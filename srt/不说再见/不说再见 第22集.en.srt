Don't say that.

4
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,680
Why? Are you worried about her?

5
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,660
No, I'm not.

6
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,420
This is business.

7
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,229
You're not supposed to be involved.

8
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,820
Take my men with you.

9
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,920
Get out of here.

Fine, I'll get going.

-Explain to me when you get home.
-Okay.

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,840
Let's talk at home.

Goodbye, Kexin.

I'll visit you at your studio someday.

Leave me alone.

33
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,800
Explain it to me, the two of you.

34

"What's going on?"

36
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,190
You have recognized the wrong person.

37
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,170
That man is not a cop.

38
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,850
He's not?

39
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,520
He has been working for Mr. Zhao

40
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,230
for over a decade.

41
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,730
He's probably just a look-alike.

42
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,680
"A look-alike"?

43
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,930
If he was really a cop,

44
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,690
do you think
we would've walked away safely?

45
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,240
I think you're right.

46
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,440
I never expected
that Linda's direct superior

47
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,760
would be Guanyin.

48
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,010
So it's really related to Tieguanyin.

49
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,030
I was also surprised when I got there.

50
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,720
She has really done a lot of things

51
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,780
behind my dad's back.

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,370
It's going to be interesting.

53
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,660
Then what was that gunshot about?

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,770
Tieguanyin fired it.

55
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,970
I found out through Linda

56
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,480
about Tieguanyin's private dealings.

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Tieguanyin thinks

58
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,850
that we've got something on her,

59
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,010
so she shot Linda in a fit of rage.

60
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,990
Linda is hurt?
Where was she hurt? Is it serious?

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Well, it's nothing serious.

62
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,900
The bullet just grazed her.

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,180
It's just a scrape.

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,190
What should we do next?

65
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,300
Should we tell Godfather

66
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,840
that Tieguanyin is selling the goods?

67
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,130
No way.

68
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,680
We can't be snitches.

69
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,320
If we want to destroy Tieguanyin,

70
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,820
it has to be done in one go.

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,400
She's so greedy.

72
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,130
Maybe that's her real weakness
and we can use that against her.

73
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,120
Let's play the long game

74
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,130
and catch a big fish.

75
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,490
Please speak Mandarin.

76
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,790
Not only must we keep this secret for her,

77
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,470
but we must also seize this chance

78
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,050
to get closer to her.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,430
When we finally gain her trust,

80
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,980
that's our chance to strike.

81
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,330
Not bad.

82
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,680
You're really good at playing tricks.

83
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,320
You're the one who always tricks me.

84
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,370
Yet you're judging me.

85
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,740
How is that the same?

86
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,150
That's because I like you.

87
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,690
I did it to get close to you.

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,380
Aren't we talking about a serious matter?

89
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,140
Stop flirting around.

90
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,810
I'm being serious.

91
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,840
He owes me his life today.

92
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,860
Tell me. How are you going to pay me back?

93
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,990
Will you two stop
showing affection in public?

94
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,220
There's a single man here.

95
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,110
Analyze it for him. Be unbiased.

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,560
Did I not just save his life today?

97
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,620
-All right.
-Didn't I?

98
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,670
Okay, carry on.

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,170
-I'll go away, all right?
-Tell him.

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,150
-I'll take a shower.
-How will you thank me?

101
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Ruosheng.

102
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,490
How are you going to thank me?

103
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,910
How do you want me to thank you?

104
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,180
Your acting is really something.

105
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,430
What do you mean?

106
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,920
Didn't I really save your life today?

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,860
He's gone. Stop acting.

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
We're old friends. What are you afraid of?

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,700
That's one thing.

110
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,600
Stop acting. Just be normal.

111
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,310
I am normal.

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,200
The sofa is long.

113
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,140
Go on. I'll play with you.

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,520
You're too immersed in your role.

115
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,020
What's wrong?
Didn't I save your life today?

116
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm going to the bathroom.

117
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,240
Hey.

118
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,909
You're leaving just like that?

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,540
Boss, the payment
from Tongzhou has arrived.

120
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,600
It's in cash.

121
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,220
Give it to the accountant.

122
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,040
Keep a third of the amount,

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,680
and give it to the girls as a bonus.

124
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,400
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Guanyin.

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,040
The cheongsam you ordered just arrived.

126
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,180
Do you want to try it on?

127
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,760
Leave it there.

128
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,440
Get to work.

129
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,760
All right.

130
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,030
Do you know why I shot you today?

131
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,860
I don't like silly and naive girls.

132
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,820
You were so careless.

133
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,550
How could you provoke

134
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,170
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng?

135
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,120
You caused me so much trouble.

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,670
This shot...

137
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,280
You must endure it.

138
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,850
Does it hurt?

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you know why I like this type of fish?

140
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,130
Because...

141
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
they have a beautiful appearance.

142
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,820
They are always

143
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,760
so relaxed in the water

144
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,740
without a worry in the world.

145
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,080
But...

146
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,550
Once they come across other fish,

147
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,540
they'll jump right on it

148
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
and never let go,

149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,130
until they swallow the fish down.

150
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,210
I still think this is a bit too risky.

151
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,300
As long as we can take down Tieguanyin,

152
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,060
I think it's worth the risk.

153
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,550
You and Tieguanyin working together,

154
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,490
that is outright playing tricks

155
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,760
under Godfather's nose.

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,170
Once you take that step,

157
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,540
there's no going back.

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,010
Can't you think of some other ways?

159
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,220
Tell me then. What other ways do we have?

160
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,130
That's already the least risky way.

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,340
If we go against Tieguanyin head-on,

162
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,150
that's how we will lose big-time.

163
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,260
This is called

164
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,110
"using your opponent's strength
against them."

165
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,830
I see.

166
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,910
I hope

167
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,250
that you can be like this type of fish.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,690
Do you understand?

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,970
Today, Li Ruosheng called.

170
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,040
He asked how you are doing.

171
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,650
I answered him for you.

172
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,830
I told him that you're all right.

173
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,900
There's also Mu Qing.

174
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,760
He wants to see the new product samples.

175
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,580
You will deliver the samples to them

176
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,250
first thing tomorrow morning.

177
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,390
Yes, boss.

178
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,740
Don't be so courteous.

179
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,580
You can call me by my name.

180
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,710
There's only so much money you can make.

181
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,120
But you only live once.

182
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,180
We're all only trying to make a living.

183
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,770
Let's take it easy from now on.

184
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,050
These samples
weren't processed beforehand.

185
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,900
Let's give them out and see the feedback.

186
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,070
My boss will be waiting to hear from you.

187
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,340
Linda.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,320
Let me change your medicine.

189
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,910
Worry about yourself.

190
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,400
That brat is so thoughtful.

191
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,870
Did he...

192
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,550
save your life twice?

193
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,680
Yes.

194
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,470
Does he make your heart flutter?

195
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,890
No.

196
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,070
He's handsome,

197
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,790
thoughtful,

198
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,640
and also capable.

199
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,450
It's only natural

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,520
that you would fall for such a man.

201
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,900
If I were you,

202
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,060
I might have fallen for him too.

203
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,360
Mu Qing just called.

204
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
He said the new product samples were good.

205
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,980
He wants to make a deal with us.

206
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,110
He even asked me to bring you along.

207
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,880
He keeps mentioning your name.

208
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,440
Could it be that he has feelings for you?

209
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,220
No, he's...

210
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,240
What about him?

211
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,180
Are you trying to say

212
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,350
there's no way he has feelings for you?

213
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,580
Am I right?

214
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,120
I would like to see

215
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,550
what those two rascals

216
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,280
are up to.

217
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,790
This time,

218
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,340
whether we can take down Mu Qing or not,

219
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,990
it's all up to you.

220
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,170
Guanyin.

221
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,630
This place is not bad.

222
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,340
Welcome.

223
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,910
You made this place so successful

224
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,240
in less than three years.

225
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,480
That's incredible.

226
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,590
This is just an experience center.

227
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,440
It's just a small business.

228
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,130
I'm nothing compared to you, Guanyin.

229
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,950
Are you feeling better?

230
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,060
Guanyin.

231
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,440
Do you want to play a game?

232
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,500
Sure.

233
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,400
Let's talk business while we play.

234
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,770
Deal the cards.

235
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,260
Guanyin.

236
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,480
Linda is my lucky star.

237
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,190
Let me borrow her today.

238
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,380
Do you mind?

239
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,320
What are you talking about?

240
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,640
She's working for me.

241
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,410
How can she be your lucky star?

242
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,540
Linda is our guest today.

243
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,520
I don't think it's a good idea

244
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,840
to borrow her around.

245
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,260
That's not up to me.

246
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,340
Linda, the choice is yours.

247
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,340
This time,

248
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,960
whether we can take down Mu Qing or not,

249
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,640
it's all up to you.

250
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,770
Since I am Mr. Mu's lucky star,

251
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,470
I have no reason to not choose Mr. Mu.

252
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,640
That's a good choice.

253
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,430
A hero and a beauty.

254
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,890
Ruosheng.

255
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,630
Mu Qing has his lucky star with him today.

256
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,829
You have to be careful.

257
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,119
Deal the cards.

258
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,319
Guanyin.

259
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,740
What happened before
was just a misunderstanding.

260
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,190
Don't take it to heart.

261
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,910
Of course I won't.

262
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,650
In all fairness, you did nothing wrong.

263
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,500
However,

264
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,730
you have to understand

265
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,010
that I have my difficulties.

266
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,590
I'm looking after

267
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,910
such a huge fortune for others.

268
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,290
Who wouldn't want more shares?

269
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,430
Am I right?

270
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,660
You're right.

271
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,260
There are so many eyes on me.

272
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,900
I had no choice but to do such a thing.

273
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,890
Guanyin.

274
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,600
From now on,

275
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
your business is my business.

276
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,530
Let's let bygones be bygones.

277
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,140
I have my own way of smuggling the goods.

278
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,680
I can tell you.

279
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,420
That's great.

280
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,630
It can save me the trouble.

281
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,260
Guanyin.

282
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,620
Didn't we agree to talk while playing?

283
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,340
But why is there only talk, but no play?

284
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,590
Besides,

285
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,220
if you're discussing business,

286
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,860
shouldn't you be talking to me?

287
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm in charge.

288
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,000
But hasn't it always been Mu Qing

289
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,130
who handles business matters
on your behalf?

290
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,490
That was before.

291
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,010
I'll take charge from now on.

292
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,530
If anyone disrespects the hierarchy,

293
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,200
that's not good.

294
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,640
Mu Qing, what do you think?

295
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,190
No matter how and who does it,

296
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,990
isn't it all for our family?

297
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,880
Still, there's always
a head in the family.

298
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,030
Hey, buddy.

299
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,610
Why are you so angry?

300
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,190
Linda.

301
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,780
Pour him a cup of tea.

302
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,600
Sorry, I won.

303
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,860
Let's play again.

304
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,380
Linda.

305
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,620
In terms of seniority,

306
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,220
shouldn't you pour tea for me first?

307
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,530
It's too late.

308
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,130
I don't want it anymore.

309
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,410
Mu Qing, let me tell you.

310
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,610
I'm your superior.

311
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,590
You're working for me.

312
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,350
You'd better know your place.

313
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,400
That's it.

314
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,250
We can't play anymore.

315
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,890
Let's get some fresh air too.

316
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,040
Come on.

317
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,220
As I was saying,

318
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,510
if you disperse your goods
through my dark web,

319
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,670
no one will ever find out.

320
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,120
Including Mr. Ou.

321
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,880
In terms of that,

322
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,210
you can rest assured, Guanyin.

323
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,880
But my goods

324
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,160
worth a lot of money.

325
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,460
Can your dark web handle it?

326
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,860
I can even handle Mr. Ou's goods.

327
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,620
Are you saying

328
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,740
you have more goods than Mr. Ou does?

329
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,380
Although Dakun's traditional sales method

330
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,660
was a mess,

331
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,220
you two brought it back to life.

332
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,650
How can you be so sure

333
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,320
that the dark web you set up

334
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,310
is completely risk-free?

335
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,740
It is risky.

336
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,780
You've witnessed it yourself.

337
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,860
Unless someone tampers with it,

338
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,150
it won't bear any risk at all.

339
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,690
I know.

340
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,810
You have never trusted me.

341
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,840
Mr. Glasses and Mr. Congtou

342
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,510
have always been prejudiced against me.

343
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,240
But no matter how much
we disagree with each other,

344
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,870
we should not disagree with money.

345
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Obviously,

346
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,870
now is not a good time for anyone else.

347
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,110
Only the goods you have in hand

348
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,140
can complement my sales network.

349
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,650
If we can join forces
and use our strengths,

350
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,930
that will be perfect.

351
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,310
Let's make money together.

352
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,760
I don't see why we can't do that.

353
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,450
Besides,

354
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,710
we're in the same boat now.

355
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,820
Am I right, Guanyin?

356
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,950
Your effort in this will not be wasted.

357
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,960
Does that mean you've agreed?

358
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,250
I have another question.

359
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,240
Tell me.

360
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,060
Am I working with you

361
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,260
or the two of you?

362
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,720
I don't want our partnership

363
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,090
to make things awkward between you two.

364
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,720
That's not good.

365
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,980
Don't worry, Guanyin.

366
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,350
Ruosheng is just too caught up

367
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,360
in his temper.

368
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,430
He knows what's important and what's not.

369
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,040
Mr. Mu, we have a problem.

370
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,230
You should take a look.

371
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,200
What happened?

372
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,920
I'm not sure what happened.

373
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,420
But Mr. Li is furious.

374
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,960
Why don't you go and take a look?

375
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,010
Linda should come with you.

376
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,740
Linda, look after Mr. Mu.

377
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,760
Guanyin, I'll go and take a look.

378
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,490
That jerk!

379
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,500
Boss.

380
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,390
Ungrateful brat.
A dog is more loyal than him!

381
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,020
-Make way!
-Leave me alone!

382
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,270
I'll kill whoever stands in my way!

383
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,290
Have you lost your mind?

384
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,650
How dare you come back!

385
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,810
Wait for me here. I'll go check on him.

386
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,870
Be careful.

387
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,520
Have you lost your mind?

388
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,670
If you want to act crazy,
do it at your own place.

389
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,170
What are you doing at my house?

390
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,060
Yes, I've lost my mind!

391
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,870
Whatever you have today,

392
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,540
I gave them all to you!

393
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,080
Everything here is mine!

394
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,060
I can smash them if I want to!

395
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,550
Listen up, Mu Qing!

396
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,850
If you want to do dirty work,

397
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,610
do it behind my back!

398
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,640
How dare you talk business

399
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,530
with Tieguanyin in front of me?

400
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,770
Do you have any respect for me?

401
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,190
How about this?

402
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,180
From now on,

403
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,560
I'll be your lackey

404
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,890
and I'll call you my boss!

405
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,490
That sounds great to me.

406
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,160
You're a good lackey!

407
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,570
What do you mean?

408
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,110
What's wrong? You don't agree?

409
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,690
-Of course I don't.
-Hit me then!

410
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,920
Don't make me!

411
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,070
I dare you!

412
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,220
For real?

413
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,510
Hurry, hit me.

414
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,790
Here.

415
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,330
I'll hit you!

416
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,220
Mu Qing!

417
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,800
-Don't take me for a fool
-Mu Qing!

418
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,210
just because I go easy on you.

419
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,750
Mu Qing.

420
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,860
Li Ruosheng, are you crazy?

421
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,110
Mu Qing.

422
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,660
Mu Qing, are you okay? Does it hurt?

423
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,120
You two are really something.

424
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,440
Don't touch me!

425
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,530
I'll take you to the hospital.

426
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,640
Luckily, you're fine.

427
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,960
Does it still hurt?

428
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,860
It hurts. How can it not hurt?

429
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,340
Li Ruosheng is so ruthless.

430
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,230
Why are you two doing this?

431
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,830
I've helped him for three years.

432
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,450
Look what happened in the end.

433
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,080
All my effort has gone to waste.

434
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,560
Actually,

435
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,770
you two shouldn't be like this
because of me.

436
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,820
Men are all the same.

437
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,070
But you two are business partners.

438
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,740
How will you work together in the future?

439
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,850
From now on,

440
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,740
we'll stay out of each other's business.

441
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,590
He has no control over what I do.

442
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,220
Are you starting your own business?

443
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,560
What else can I do?

444
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,850
Isn't that what Guanyin wants?

445
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,620
I don't care what you want to do.

446
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,610
But it's not easy to work with Guanyin.

447
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,930
You have to be careful.

448
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,840
You know that too?

449
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,940
That's why you should quit.

450
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,410
I know you're trying to protect me.

451
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,080
I'm very grateful.

452
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,840
But...

453
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,350
You don't have to always care for me.

454
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,900
You'll only sink deeper into it.

455
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,210
What do you mean?

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,600
Thank you.

457
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,550
I'm grateful to you.

458
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,030
You'll always have a place in my heart.

459
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,240
Not bad.

460
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,360
Another Qingqing just left.

461
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,770
That's right.

462
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,570
This Linda...

463
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,690
She really is something.

464
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,070
Don't get the wrong idea.

465
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,790
I was only acting for her sake.

466
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,900
It had to look real for her to believe me.

467
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,390
You're such a great actor

468
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,800
with deep emotions.

469
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,180
How else could I have survived
in this industry?

470
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,280
Did Li Ruosheng send you here?

471
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,790
Of course he sent me here.

472
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
He's afraid he went overboard.

473
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,870
He wants me to see if you're all right.

474
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,250
It's okay. I'm fine.

475
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,870
I faked it.

476
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,630
Let me see.

477
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,530
I guess you're really okay.

478
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,850
You even got a hug.

479
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,060
Don't hurt me even if I'm fine.

480
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,070
You're okay, right?

481
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,480
Then don't stay here

482
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,670
and waste social resources.

483
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,680
Let's go.

484
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,140
Come on.

485
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,420
Waste of resources?

486
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,690
It's for the sake of the act.

487
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,390
That went well.

488
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
Are you still angry?

489
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,540
I was acting, you know?

490
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,500
I am acting too.

491
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,690
I'm acting like I'm jealous.

492
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,010
Your acting is really good.

493
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,510
The same goes for you.

494
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,090
Did you see them fighting

495
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,850
with your own eyes?

496
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,410
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

497
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,000
It was quite a fierce fight.

498
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,360
"A fierce fight"?

499
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,130
That's great. I love it.

500
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,720
Once they have a falling-out,

501
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
it will be easier to deal with them.

502
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,050
There's no way they could beat me.

503
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,660
Inform Mu Qing tomorrow.

504
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,940
We'll do as he suggested.

505
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,230
Give him 20% of goods first.

506
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,460
Don't give it all to him yet.

507
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,270
Why?

508
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,540
Isn't it obvious?

509
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,570
Who knows if they're having
a falling-out for real?

510
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,710
We need to test them out.

511
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,790
Just do as I say.

512
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,870
Yes, boss.

513
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,210
I've told Director Liu

514
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,830
about the plan you and Li Ruosheng have.

515
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,810
What are you going to do next?

516
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,230
I'll find out the location

517
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,730
of Tieguanyin's factory.

518
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,630
I'll have to sever
the group's lifeline first.

519
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,790
Okay.

520
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,890
By then,

521
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,350
just let me know what you need me to do.

522
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,990
Sure. Cheers.

523
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,280
How long have you known Liu Qingqing?

524
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,530
We've known each other for a few years.

525
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,630
What's wrong?

526
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,170
It's nothing.

527
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,750
I just feel

528
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,560
that the relationship between you two

529
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,270
is not as simple as I thought.

530
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,630
Look at you. You're asking about it again.

531
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,080
I told you before.

532
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,620
I'm just putting on an act.

533
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,900
You ask that every day.

534
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,090
You're so paranoid.

535
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,420
About that hug today,

536
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,910
tell me the truth.

537
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,160
Does Liu Qingqing have feelings for you?

538
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,220
Be careful.

539
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,980
When she can't hold
her feelings in anymore,

540
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,740
you won't be able to walk away from it.

541
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,620
What do you mean?

542
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,270
You'll see.

543
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,060
I guess

544
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,180
it's better for me to stay away from you.

545
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,980
And why would you do that?

546
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,930
You see.

547
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,340
Although Tieguanyin wants to do

548
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,360
a big business because of her greed,

549
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,550
we can't be sure

550
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,780
that my dad won't suspect you

551
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,840
of pocketing the money.

552
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,380
On top of that, you've always been

553
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,740
a thorn in Mr. Glasses's flesh.

554
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,030
If he spreads false rumors
about you to my dad,

555
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,720
you'll be in even more danger.

556
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,390
So you're talking about work.

557
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,260
What did you think I meant?

558
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,830
I thought it was work too.

559
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,600
-Of course it's about work.
-Sure.

560
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,430
So what are your plans?

561
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,450
Me?

562
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,210
I'm going to play it by ear.

563
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,450
I'll make use of Liu Qingqing's
feelings for you

564
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,210
and pretend to be jealous.

565
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,890
I'll fight with you

566
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,070
and move back to my dad's

567
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,610
so that I can keep an eye on him too.

568
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,150
By doing that,

569
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,910
it can also distract his attention

570
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,500
from you and Guanyin.

571
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,910
I'll also let him know

572
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,270
how important you are to me.

573
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,370
Then he and Mr. Glasses

574
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,730
won't dare do anything to you.

575
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,910
Sure, let's do as you say.

576
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,860
Just now,

577
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,410
when I said it was about work,

578
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,860
deep down inside,

579
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,210
did you feel a little bit disappointed?

580
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,090
You have such bad observation skills.

581
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,450
Why would I feel disappointed?

582
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,140
When did I feel disappointed?
That doesn't make sense.

583
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,430
It's all over your face.

584
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,320
My face? Was it written on my face?

585
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
I look the same every day.

586
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,880
I'm always emotionless.

587
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,770
You still won't admit it?

588
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,830
Fine.

589
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,840
Admit what?

590
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,380
What are you looking at? It's the same.

591
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,320
[Traitor]

592
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,310
[Traitor]

593
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,000
That's a bit too much.

594
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,580
What?

595
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,760
Mr. Glasses.

596
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,570
I'm sure you have heard.

597
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,870
Yes.

598
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,020
I didn't expect things

599
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,440
to progress so quickly.

600
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,450
Tieguanyin's dark web

601
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
has helped her earn quite a lot of money.

602
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,850
Compared to the losses

603
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,040
she suffered before,

604
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,190
it's not worth mentioning.

605
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,570
Are you jealous?

606
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,930
I can't get jealous.

607
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,130
Tieguanyin has one word

608
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,240
written all over her face.

609
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,340
"Greed."

610
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,810
She would go to whoever that has money.

611
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,920
She's a woman.

612
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,720
She has the ability to do so,

613
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,350
but we don't.

614
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,070
We are incapable.

615
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,260
You're still jealous.

616
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,280
It's all for the money.

617
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,730
There's nothing more to say.

618
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,210
But on the other hand,

619
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,760
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing

620
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,210
have quite a bit of skill.

621
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,670
They only use a few shabby computers.

622
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,860
But they're able to make

623
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,580
a few fold increase in sales.

624
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,160
The profit they make

625
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,490
is like water flowing into their pockets.

626
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,710
Li Ruosheng.

627
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,650
This fool is considered lucky.

628
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,500
If it wasn't for Mu Qing,

629
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,000
he wouldn't be so successful today.

630
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,970
Am I right?

631
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,430
Who cares if he's really a fool?

632
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,320
There's also a possibility

633
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,860
for a fool to be enlightened someday.

634
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,250
What do you mean?

635
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,320
His lackey is more capable than him.

636
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,950
How do you think that makes him feel?

637
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,060
I don't know how he feels.

638
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,400
If it were me, I would never allow it.

639
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,250
Recently,

640
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,180
Mu Qing and Tieguanyin are very close.

641
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,640
She's obviously fond of him.

642
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,140
Who can stop her?

643
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,770
It's okay if she is only fond of him.

644
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,230
What if there's something else?

645
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,140
My friend.

646
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,300
Whatever it is,

647
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,620
it has nothing to do with us.

648
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,940
This matter

649
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,400
is Mr. Ou's concern.

650
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,200
How do you have time to please me?

651
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,020
What are you talking about?

652
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,610
I'm your daughter. Can't I visit you?

653
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,930
Look.

654
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,430
Your house is so big.

655
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,660
It has everything.

656
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,290
But do you have a daughter?

657
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,470
Why do you sound so sarcastic?

658
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,010
What's bothering you?

659
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
I just missed you.

660
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,560
That's too sweet for me to handle.

661
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,490
Sit down.

662
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,430
Did Mu Qing bully you?

663
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,640
You're acting weird.

664
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,840
You weren't like this the other day.

665
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,220
I think what you said that day was right.

666
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,160
When you're in a relationship,

667
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,700
you have to be careful.

668
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,680
I've decided

669
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,090
to not see him for a few days.

670
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,570
Tell me. What's going on?

671
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,140
Talking about it makes me furious.

672
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,160
Mu Qing's ex-girlfriend
is causing trouble.

673
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,760
His ex-girlfriend?

674
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,610
Did she get in your way?

675
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,320
Yes.

676
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,180
And coincidentally, she works for Guanyin.

677
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,080
So what does Mu Qing think?

678
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,840
What else can he be thinking?

679
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,350
But Dad, let me tell you.

680
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,190
She's no ordinary woman.

681
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,610
She's quite pretty.

682
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,590
Even Li Ruosheng falls for her.

683
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,260
After Li Ruosheng found out about

684
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,540
her relationship with Mu Qing,

685
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,270
it even caused a conflict between them.

686
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,080
Are you sure?

687
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,900
Of course.

688
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,180
Guanyin has been trying

689
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,850
to get on Mu Qing's good side lately.

690
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,830
She wants to do business
using his sales network.

691
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,420
Mu Qing seems to be unhappy with it.

692
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,450
But in reality, I bet he's more than happy

693
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,810
to be working with his ex.

694
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,880
Dad, be the judge.

695
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,550
Isn't this ex-girlfriend a troublemaker?

696
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,190
You said Tieguanyin

697
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,860
is close to Mu Qing lately?

698
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,100
Yes.

699
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,860
And you know it too.

700
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,570
All of Guanyin's girls

701
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,510
are very pretty.

702
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,960
They have nice figures too.

703
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,760
I'm so jealous.

704
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,300
But I can't tell anyone about it.

705
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,060
That's why

706
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,480
I'm avoiding Mu Qing.

707
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,540
But thanks to him,

708
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,660
I have time to come back and visit you.

709
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,970
Dad, what's wrong?

710
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,560
I'm not telling you all this
to make you worry.

711
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,620
I know.

712
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,760
When women are in love,

713
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,130
we must keep our eyes wide open.

714
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,770
I get it now.

715
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,360
Love is easy, but it's hard to get along.

716
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,950
Are you backing out?

717
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,750
No way.

718
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,070
I'm your daughter.

719
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,210
You don't understand.

720
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,550
Mu Qing is so popular.

721
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,920
That means he's attractive and charming.

722
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,150
What does that prove?

723
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,630
Your daughter has good taste.

724
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,260
What are you planning to do?

725
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,060
You don't understand.

726
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,730
If I want a good relationship,

727
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,070
I shouldn't be reckless.

728
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,650
I need to play some tricks.

729
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,510
I'll just ignore him for a few days.

730
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,940
This is called playing hard to get.

731
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,250
Then how do you want me to support you?

732
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,200
I just need you

733
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,270
to let me stay with you for a few days.

734
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,630
Let him feel how hard life is without me.

735
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,970
I would love that.

736
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,240
I knew you're the best.

737
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,610
Men are nothing.

738
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,110
Only my dad would always love me.

739
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,600
I didn't give you a good massage earlier.

740
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,000
Tell me where it hurts.

741
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,460
Let me give you a massage.

742
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,840
What's going on with you?

743
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,170
Mu Qing's ex-girlfriend

744
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,310
is working for Tieguanyin.

745
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,500
Why didn't you tell me

746
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,690
such an important matter?

747
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,460
Is that true?

748
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,530
Kexin was so mad that she came back home.

749
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,720
How could it be fake?

750
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,750
I'm sorry, sir.

751
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,220
This is my fault.

752
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,070
This woman is not that simple.

753
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,740
