[Episode 24]

3
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,410
Have some tea, Guanyin.

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,289
I quote what Mr. Ou said.

5
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,680
"Please take care of Kexin and Mu Qing."

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,289
It's understandable if it's just Ou Kexin.

7
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,650
But it's sort of strange

8
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,600
to mention you as well.

9
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,180
Guanyin.

10
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,820
You underestimated Mr. Ou.

11
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,330
You think he doesn't know about our deal?

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,370
Does he know?

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,050
What do you think

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
we should do then?

15
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,630
I think

16
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,870
as long as we don't go too far,

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,110
Mr. Ou won't do anything to us.

18
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,340
We have something.

19
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,920
Mr. Mu, 15 pieces.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,870
Fifteen pieces?

21
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,690
Who's the buyer?

22
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,310
Guanyin.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
They don't ask about our sources,

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,480
so we don't ask who they are.

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,800
That's my rule.

26
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,000
How do we deliver the goods?

27
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,630
That's easy.

28
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,610
You put the goods somewhere.

29
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,250
Then contact the buyer
through the dark web.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,570
Once it's confirmed,

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,850
he'll pick up the goods.

32
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,030
That's good. We don't need to deliver it.

33
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,150
That's not all.

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,340
In the dark web system,

35
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,829
I installed more than three layers

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,070
of virtual private networks.

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,180
Even if the police find out,

38
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,070
our deals will already be done.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,140
They won't see anything.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,480
Safe shipping and transferring.

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,910
The whole process is off the grid.

42
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,940
That's amazing.

43
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,450
Guess what it is.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,470
Is it goldthread?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,120
Do you think that I'm hiding my pain?

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,730
Goldthread?

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,770
Ruosheng.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,700
We're in the same business.

49
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,640
Don't you know what that is?

50
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,850
It's ephedra.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,540
All the goods you're selling

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,090
are all made from this thing.

53
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,740
Bring it over.

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,910
Come on, Ruosheng.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,380
Try it out.

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,390
Congtou.

57
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,940
Godfather makes the rule.

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Even if you kill me,

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,100
I wouldn't dare touch it.

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,220
Yes, knowing what we do,

61
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,600
we really shouldn't touch this.

62
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,470
But how many people

63
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,100
have lost their lives

64
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,250
for such a thing?

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,320
At my age,

66
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,430
I can't do drugs anymore.

67
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,590
Otherwise, I might die.

68
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,400
Bring it here.

69
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,420
I want to show you something.

70
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,750
Take a look.

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,490
It's so pure.

72
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,450
This isn't Guanyin's product.

73
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,000
Ruosheng.

74
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,500
Today,

75
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm offering you my secret.

76
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,350
Congtou.

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,170
I don't quite understand.

78
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,370
You know what they say.

79
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,270
"A mountain isn't big enough
for two tigers."

80
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,040
But what if a new tiger comes?

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,760
You have two choices.

82
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,750
Either you chase away the new tiger

83
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,480
or you're the one who will have to scram.

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,330
Then you'll be out of the game.

85
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,320
In our line of work,

86
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,030
in the end,

87
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,070
it's all about the purity level.

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,780
Guanyin can't make products this pure.

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,990
You were talking about this factory.

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
Show me around sometime.

91
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,100
Show you what?

92
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,740
Guanyin, don't be like that.

93
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,330
I just want to know more

94
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,380
about the factory.

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,190
If we have a large order one day

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,730
and we can't deliver,

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,310
won't that be awkward?

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,170
Don't worry. That won't happen.

99
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,640
You still don't trust me, do you?

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
It's not about trusting you.

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,290
If you want to eat eggs,

102
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,400
you don't have to see the hen
that laid the eggs.

103
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,960
Just eat the eggs at ease.

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,550
As for the production,

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
just leave that to us.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,050
Besides, the more people know,

107
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,150
the more dangerous it is.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,910
You never know what could happen.

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,760
If something goes wrong,

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,480
Group K will be burned to ashes.

111
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,080
Group K hasn't been authorized

112
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,320
to sell Spectre's new goods.

113
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,700
If we make a mistake,

114
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,380
both of us will be in big trouble.

115
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,290
I understand, Guanyin.

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,909
I was just asking.

117
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,370
Don't get so worked up.

118
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,120
I'm a rookie.

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,670
But I'm really not the tiger.

120
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,850
All I want

121
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,960
is to teach Mu Qing a lesson.

122
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,380
But I've never wanted to involve Guanyin.

123
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,490
Right.

124
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,740
You don't want to mess with Guanyin.

125
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,940
But have you ever thought

126
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,240
that Mu Qing and Guanyin

127
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,780
might gang up on you one day?

128
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,130
Ruosheng.

129
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,530
Do you really think

130
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,070
that Mu Qing and Tieguanyin

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,920
are running a business together?

132
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,730
I'm telling you.

133
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,930
Mu Qing is doing it for two reasons.

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,640
Number one.

135
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,409
He's using Tieguanyin as a shield.

136
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,830
He'll kick you out

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,890
and get rid of you.

138
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,030
Number two.

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,750
He's standing on her shoulders

140
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,550
and climbing up the ladder,

141
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,580
gaining status in the business.

142
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,850
Do you know what it's called?

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,570
"Kill two birds with one stone."

144
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,300
With Mu Qing's intelligence,

145
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,790
it won't even take a year

146
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,860
before someone like me

147
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,460
gets kicked out and trampled by them.

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
No matter what,

149
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,060
Guanyin was always there for me.

150
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,820
I really can't mess with her.

151
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,780
You're really smart.

152
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,640
But personally, I think

153
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,360
that compared to me,

154
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,260
you're missing the most important thing.

155
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,230
What is it?

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,860
You don't know how to play dumb.

157
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,420
I've been in this business for so long.

158
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,419
I've seen many of our people die,

159
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,440
get injured, crippled, and ruined.

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,549
So I've come to a realization.

161
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,190
There can only be one smart guy in a gang.

162
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,520
It's enough that Mr. Ou is smart.

163
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,240
We as his subordinates

164
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,970
are better off being a little stupid.

165
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,340
It's safer.

166
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,150
You're right.

167
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,950
Tell me.

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Mu Qing has done so much for our group.

169
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,590
Why does your godfather

170
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,370
still give him the cold shoulder?

171
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,970
Godfather doesn't like him.

172
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,000
He doesn't want Mu Qing as his son-in-law.

173
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,100
You're wrong.

174
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,120
It has nothing to do with that.

175
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,720
Let me tell you.

176
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,520
As the old saying goes,

177
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,510
"cleverness may overreach itself."

178
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,110
Your intelligence might wrong you.

179
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm telling you.

180
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,890
Mu Qing is too smart.

181
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,920
It's scary how smart he is.

182
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,820
Even your godfather is scared.

183
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,000
But Ruosheng,

184
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,490
you're different.

185
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,610
You are loyal.

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,910
You're loyal to your friends and men.

187
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,600
You're a fast worker.

188
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,830
Let's just say,

189
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,410
in my opinion,

190
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,170
in your godfather's heart,

191
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,210
you're his successor.

192
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,760
This is not funny.

193
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,390
I'm really unsuitable.

194
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm not kidding.

195
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,250
Let me put it this way.

196
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,850
Mu Qing made the dark web system.

197
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,780
But now, you get the gist of it.

198
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,190
Am I right?

199
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,350
So you can do it without him.

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,710
-Am I right?
-Yes.

201
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,030
I think

202
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,890
I'm a little better than Guanyin

203
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,870
in many ways.

204
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,760
If we're together,

205
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,350
we'll make a powerful team.

206
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,020
We can bid them goodbye

207
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,470
and get rid of them.

208
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,970
In the future,

209
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,750
this group will be ours.

210
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm too old to be ambitious.

211
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,820
So it will be yours in the future.

212
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,320
But...

213
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,780
as long as I'm here,

214
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,610
I promise I'll never let you suffer.

215
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,900
Thank you, Congtou.

216
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,660
Here, have a drink.

217
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,970
Bottoms up.

218
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
One more glass.

219
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,890
You mentioned the new product.

220
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,830
What if...

221
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,300
Spectre and Mr. Ou really made the deal?

222
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,940
It will affect you greatly.

223
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,650
What are you going to do then?

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,810
You're right.

225
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,740
I know it too.

226
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,870
But what can I do?

227
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,330
Everyone calls me greedy,

228
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,690
and they're right.

229
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,250
But every morning,

230
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,230
I think I'm hearing the death knell.

231
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,350
When I'm not needed by Mr. Ou or Group K,

232
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,150
I, Tieguanyin, become worthless.

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,570
What should I do then?

234
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,210
I think you don't need to worry

235
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,450
about money anymore.

236
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,600
You're a woman

237
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,050
who runs a drug factory.

238
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,770
But you're still all alone.

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,510
What exactly do you want?

240
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,110
You don't understand.

241
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,890
As a woman, I have thought

242
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,560
about marriage, kids, and family.

243
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,720
It's not like I don't want those.

244
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,370
But everything I've been through

245
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,730
made me swear to myself

246
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,980
that I, Tie Guan Yin, must be strong.

247
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,040
I must be stronger than men.

248
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,610
I want those who bullied and opposed me

249
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,540
to kneel in front of me.

250
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,860
So...

251
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,540
So...

252
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,620
So...

253
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,790
Here, Guanyin.

254
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,760
Have some tea.

255
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,860
Don't think about it.

256
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:18,040
[Li Ruosheng: See you tonight.
I have big news for you.]

257
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,570
Why tea?

258
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,240
I want some alcohol.

259
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,780
Alcohol? I have some.

260
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,880
I'll get it for you now.

261
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,150
It's not a big deal.

262
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,340
You're a smart kid.

263
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,730
How did it go?

264
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,550
He took the bait.

265
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,690
What about you?

266
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,910
I made a few deals with Guanyin.

267
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,850
But she still doesn't trust me.

268
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,280
Compared to Guanyin,

269
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,140
Congtou is not having a great time.

270
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,910
Didn't you say you have big news?

271
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,230
What is it?

272
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,260
Take a look.

273
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,350
It's 97% pure.

274
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,020
Guess who made it.

275
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,300
I don't have to.

276
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
It's definitely Congtou.

277
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,220
It looks like Congtou

278
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,940
has made up his mind long ago.

279
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,270
He was waiting for the right time.

280
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,230
I've been thinking about something.

281
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,340
We already have money and high status.

282
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,140
We can live very well.

283
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,180
But what are we still working hard for?

284
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,760
What are we after?

285
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,900
What's wrong? Are you scared?

286
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,000
"Scared"?

287
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,330
I've never been scared.

288
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,840
I just think that...

289
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,650
I know what you mean.

290
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,380
Everyone has their own goals.

291
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,700
We all want different things.

292
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,420
That's right.

293
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,420
But we've been brothers for so long.

294
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,280
You've never told me what you want.

295
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,390
What I want are a warm home

296
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,980
and a safe and secure life.

297
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,870
Hold it in. Don't laugh.

298
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,540
It's a small wish.

299
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,550
Are you serious?

300
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,310
-Really? Are you serious?
-I'm very serious.

301
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,540
-I'm not kidding.
-Okay.

302
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,790
Fine. You're serious.

303
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,330
But in all seriousness,

304
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,250
whether you want to be an angel

305
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,010
or the devil,

306
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,690
I'll always support you.

307
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,990
Are you touched?

308
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,510
My goodness.

309
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,450
Come on.

310
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,740
We should still celebrate.

311
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,050
Don't tease me like that.

312
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,590
I'll call you "Angel" from now on.

313
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,860
Thank you for tonight.

314
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
There's no need.

315
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm just returning the favor.

316
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,450
"Returning the favor"?

317
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,770
All right, I'll arrange the next one.

318
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,500
There's a "next one"?

319
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,560
Of course.

320
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,760
Can't I?

321
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,280
Mr. Huang, don't you understand?

322
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,550
I had dinner with you

323
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
just to return the favor.

324
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,410
That wasn't a date.

325
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,490
But for me,

326
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,569
if a man and a woman have a meal together,

327
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,849
that means they're on a date.

328
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,339
Please.

343
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,200
He's currently working
for Yungang Medical Group

344
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,840
and in charge of research
and development of cancer medicine.

345
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,780
What about his parents?

346
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,510
His dad is Huang Yuankun.

347
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,560
His mom is Liu Jie.

348
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,690
In the 1990s, they moved to Thailand.

349
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,500
Later, they were close
with friends in India.

350
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,170
In early the 2000s,

351
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,930
the two families sold

352
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,350
cheap anticancer drugs in our country.

353
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,290
After making money,

354
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,330
they opened a few more factories.

355
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,750
They went from being the seller

356
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,150
to become the manufacturer.

357
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,450
What's their connection with Tieguanyin?

358
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,910
We don't know yet.

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,050
But five years ago,

360
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,330
our customs found

361
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,650
a batch of smuggled ephedrine.

362
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,070
Its source was a drug factory abroad.

363
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,530
That factory belongs to the Huang family.

364
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,080
But this is an international case.

365
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,440
They didn't find anything.

366
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,590
So that was it.

367
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,170
That means

368
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,720
the Huang family could be the source
of the methamphetamine.

369
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,790
We can't confirm that yet.

370
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,420
Then confirm it.

371
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,610
Zheng Ke.

372
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,280
Have you contacted the Indian police?

373
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,680
Zheng Ke?

374
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,600
-Captain Rong.
-Don't be distracted.

375
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
Have you contacted the Indian police?

376
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,500
Not yet.

377
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,820
I'll make the call right away.

378
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,050
I'll go now.

379
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,300
What's wrong with Zheng Ke lately?

380
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,020
He has been absentminded.

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,490
Did you report on Huang Boyuan?

382
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,520
Yes.

383
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,670
But Rong Yao hasn't replied.

384
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,800
I think Guanyin is behind everything.

385
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,180
I didn't expect Tieguanyin

386
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,640
to be so sneaky.

387
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,790
We pretended to have broken up.

388
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,730
And she managed to take this chance

389
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,880
and use Huang Boyuan to separate us.

390
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,050
It doesn't matter how sneaky she is.

391
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,940
She will never expect

392
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,850
that we're police officers.

393
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm telling you.

394
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,640
You just got lucky

395
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,090
and made the right guess.

396
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,730
Until we know for sure,

397
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,680
I will keep in touch with Huang Boyuan.

398
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,230
I'm sure Huang Boyuan and Tieguanyin

399
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,860
can't hide their secret.

400
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,700
What about me? What should I do?

401
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,800
You?

402
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,050
Keep acting in front of Tieguanyin.

403
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,630
I know that.

404
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,590
Also, you can act jealous

405
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,670
in front of Huang Boyuan.

406
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,750
Act jealous?

407
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,860
Do you think my character

408
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,970
is the jealous type?

409
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,650
Why not?

410
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,360
They say everyone is an idiot

411
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,900
when they're in love.

412
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,060
Kexin, this mission isn't a game.

413
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,560
Please be careful.

414
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,880
Don't make any mistakes.

415
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,770
I know. I won't make any mistakes.

416
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,260
You'd better don't.

417
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,680
Here.

418
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,150
Here's your fried rice.

419
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,350
This time, I put kale in it.

420
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,160
Enjoy it. I'm leaving.

421
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,180
Wait.

422
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,860
In return, here's your suit.

423
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,460
It's for me?

424
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,260
Try it on.

425
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,890
I don't have to.

426
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,910
You know my size. I trust you.

427
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Thank you.

428
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,050
Hello?

429
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,550
This is Zheng Yixiao's dad.

430
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,100
[Zheng Yixiao is in danger. Come now.]

431
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,860
Okay, I'll be right there.

432
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,630
Doctor Guan, how is Yixiao doing?

433
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,520
He's stable for now.

434
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,930
But...

435
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,210
Let's talk in my office.

436
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,000
If the nurse hadn't noticed it,

437
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,940
it would've been bad.

438
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,870
The child almost lost

439
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,150
all his kidney function.

440
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,040
His hyperkalemia is leading

441
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,020
to total organ failure.

442
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,130
Even with three dialyses a week,

443
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,670
it won't get better.

444
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,160
Don't worry.

445
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,010
Our hospital has been looking for donors

446
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,420
for our patients.

447
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,050
But it's still risky.

448
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,510
You also have to be prepared.

449
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,780
You're awake, Xiaoxiao.

450
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,030
Dad, you were sound asleep.

451
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,500
I'm so tired.

452
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,780
Dad.

453
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,110
Can you take me downstairs to play later?

454
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,170
Sure, but you have to eat first.

455
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,330
Wait here. I'll get you some food.

456
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,600
-All right?
-Okay.

457
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,680
[Dad.]

458
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,130
[Let me ask you something.]

459
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,890
[You have to answer me properly.]

460
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,120
[Go ahead.]

461
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,320
[Am I just like Mom?]

462
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,910
[Am I also going on a trip]

463
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,090
[to a faraway place?]

464
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,500
Who told you that?

465
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,670
It was painful last night.

466
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,430
I wanted to call you.

467
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,230
But I couldn't speak.

468
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,740
I heard Nurse Zhao telling the doctor

469
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,600
if I don't get a kidney donor,

470
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,360
I will...

471
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,620
Dad, was she telling the truth?

472
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,470
Of course not.

473
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,150
You'll get better.

474
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,160
Really?

475
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,170
It's true.

476
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,450
Don't you trust me?

477
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,940
Of course I do.

478
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,360
That way, I can be with you.

479
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,250
I won't have to go far away.

480
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,940
Can I go to school after I get better?

481
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
Of course.

482
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,400
It's not just that.

483
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,220
You'll also go to elementary school,
middle school, and the university.

484
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,190
All right?

485
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,200
When I graduate,

486
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,400
I will become a police officer.

487
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,600
Like your Task Force 84,

488
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,870
I'll catch drug dealers.

489
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,900
Okay.

490
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,520
-Pinky swear.
-Okay.

491
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,590
Don't break the promise

492
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,260
for a hundred years.

493
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,320
And seal it.

494
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,210
Drug enforcement officer?

495
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,460
Task Force 84?

496
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,950
Yes.

497
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,240
Did you hear it right?

498
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,430
I wasn't sure,

499
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,980
so I asked my son to ask the young girl.

500
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,300
It's true.

501
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,860
What's the girl's name?

502
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,930
Zheng Yixiao. Her dad's name is Zheng Ke.

503
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,780
He's in the Network
Supervision Department.

504
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,050
Does Zheng Yixiao have a kidney donor?

505
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,630
Not yet.

506
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,160
Don't worry, your son will have a donor.

507
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,790
Thank you.

508
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,110
You may leave.

509
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,140
Glasses.

510
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,160
Have you done a background check

511
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,180
on Task Force 84?

512
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,800
I'll find out as soon as I can.

513
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,510
They're finally showing the cracks.

514
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,840
You did a good job.

515
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,470
Remember.

516
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,190
Find out about it.

517
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,430
Yes.

518
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,330
Take care of the store.

519
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,490
-Hello.
-Are you Mr. Zhao?

520
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,940
Yes. Please get in.

521
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,900
Did you look into
Huang Boyuan's background?

522
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,260
Here is everything you asked for.

523
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,190
How is Mu Qing doing?

524
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,570
Mu Qing is close to Tieguanyin.

525
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,290
Tell me specifically.

526
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,060
Congtou is trying to replace Tieguanyin.

527
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,630
He also has the technique and ability.

528
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,150
Mu Qing took advantage of this.

529
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,840
He put on a show with Li Ruosheng.

530
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,460
You mean, Mu Qing

531
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,230
wants to make Tieguanyin and Congtou...

532
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,180
Mu Qing also wants me to ask you

533
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,770
if we should continue

534
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,050
taking out Tieguanyin?

535
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,370
Once Tieguanyin falls,

536
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,050
Congtou will take her place.

537
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,620
That will be a big change for us.

538
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,920
I can't decide on my own.

539
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,940
Wait for my message.

540
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,930
Got it.

541
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,870
If there's nothing else,

542
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,640
I'll get going.

543
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,470
Rong Yu.

544
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,720
I know everything.

545
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,010
Director Wang told me.

546
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,690
Rong Yao.

547
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,660
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,080
♫ Actually, I didn't tell you ♫

549
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,860
♫ About my loneliness ♫

550
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,680
I know everything.

551
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,710
♫ Wandering at night ♫

552
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,950
♫ Does it belong to you ♫

553
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,820
Don't cry, Rong Yu.

554
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,450
Don't cry.

555
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,820
When the mission is over,

556
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,920
♫ At times, I would look ♫

557
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,680
I'll take you home.

558
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,280
♫ At the grains of sand
on the boundless sea ♫

559
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,700
♫ There's no fear
even when the waves hit ♫

560
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,000
You and Yuanwen...

561
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,100
Don't worry.

562
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,400
♫ I want to drag him down
from heaven into hell ♫

563
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,040
I won't tell him.

564
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,550
I won't say a word.

565
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,560
♫ Have my back pushed to the wall ♫

566
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,940
♫ Uncover every mask ♫

567
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,910
♫ Every time I walk past here ♫

568
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,710
♫ I am drenched with confusion
in the night ♫

569
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,090
♫ The rain in the morning ♫

570
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,920
♫ Have seen uncontrollable emotions ♫

571
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,130
♫ I tell myself ♫

572
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,140
I'm leaving.

573
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,150
♫ Holding your hand ♫

574
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,650
Okay.

575
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,190
Take care.

576
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,180
♫ I walk out of this bustling city ♫

577
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,980
♫ And walk through this forest ♫

578
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,110
♫ To meet the most ferocious beast ♫

579
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,290
♫ Look at how vast the sky is ♫

580
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,510
♫ The world is my playground ♫

581
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,210
♫ Tearful smiles ♫

582
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,720
♫ When the sky lights up ♫

583
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,320
Ms. Ou.

584
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,920
What a coincidence.

585
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,780
Why are you here?

586
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,380
I'm a regular at this bookstore too.

587
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,280
I guess we were meant to meet again.

588
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,620
I already saw you back at the bookstore.

589
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,250
But you didn't notice me.

590
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,550
I think you cried earlier.

591
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,980
It's nothing.

592
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,320
You must have been touched

593
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,550
by the content of the book.

594
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,760
"Poems of Shelley."

595
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,340
It's very profound.

596
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,810
But it doesn't move me.

597
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,490
I didn't expect you

598
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,780
to be so delicate.

599
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,220
Does it concern you?

600
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,560
Right.

601
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,840
I know a great restaurant.

602
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,870
May I have the honor

603
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,110
to treat you to lunch?

604
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,550
Please.

605
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,610
She's not only using Huang Boyuan

606
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,590
to go against me,

607
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,710
but she's also using him

608
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,370
to get close to the Ou family.

609
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,230
Tieguanyin.

610
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,720
I always thought

611
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,610
that she was just a stupid woman

612
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,290
who is cooped up in her factory.

613
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,910
I didn't think

614
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,110
she would be so sly.

615
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,740
Congtou.

616
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,650
I'll take care of Huang Boyuan.

617
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,420
There's no rush.

618
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,790
She's still a stupid woman.

619
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,170
She doesn't get it.

620
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,900
If she tries to take such a huge bite,

621
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,700
she's the one

622
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,950
who will suffocate in the end.

623
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,800
Guanyin looks down on me.

624
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,400
That's not it.

625
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,520
My boss told me that you deserve it.

626
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,540
I want cooperation, not employment.

627
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,520
Guanyin should know that.

628
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,880
Take your time.

629
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,989
You can't succeed after one try.

630
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,260
Thank you.

631
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,580
I've seen your tears at the bookstore.

632
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,260
Why don't we talk about it?

633
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,380
I don't think we're close enough

634
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,060
to have a deep conversation.

635
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,610
But we can get to know each other.

636
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,980
If you ask me,

637
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,180
I would say let's keep our distance.

638
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,600
It's better to be distant.

639
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,270
Are you really not working

640
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,290
with Li Ruosheng anymore?

641
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,460
He has been fooling around.

642
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,390
He talks about everything when he's drunk.

643
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,680
He's hot-headed and careless.

644
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,310
He's a troublemaker.

645
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,740
How can I work with someone like that?

646
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,980
Is it because of me?

647
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,140
Why do you say that?

648
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,390
Because I've been thinking
about it lately.

649
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,680
If I had listened to you back then

650
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,660
and stayed away from drugs,

651
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,760
could we have...

652
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,170
I only saved you back then

653
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,290
because I was worried about your life.

654
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,410
As for the rest,

655
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,170
I had no idea.

656
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,760
-Right
-Mu Qing.

657
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,220
Tell Guanyin.

658
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,980
"Thank you for appreciating me."

659
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,380
Ms. Ou.

660
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,710
I...

661
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,620
I don't think I've offended you.

662
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,970
No. What's wrong?

663
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,120
It's nothing.

664
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,700
I just think

665
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,690
that I never did anything wrong to you.

666
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,080
So you shouldn't be so disgusted by me.

667
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,410
Forgive me.

668
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,690
This is just how I am.

669
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,550
I always smile at the people I like.

670
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,960
But to people I don't like,

671
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,670
I won't lead them on.

672
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,620
Okay.

673
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,890
So what kind of man do you like?

674
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,010
For example,

675
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,920
like the man who stood next to you

676
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,590
at the bookstore today?

677
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,710
Yes, that's my type.

678
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,570
He looks sharp, handsome, and cool.

679
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,110
I can be like that too.

680
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,910

Of course.

But in the future,

718

we'll meet again.

719
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,100
Not bad.

You acted so well this time.

From what I heard,

Huang Boyuan is not bad.

728

Huang Boyuan is an MIT graduate.

729
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,300
He studied biomedicine.

730

His parents live in Thailand.

Sir.

735
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,140
I wonder what you think of this.

736

I guess I was worried for nothing.

738

if Kexin will be interested in him.

740
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,790
Whether she's interested or not,

741
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,250
it's better than her being
with Mu Qing all the time.

we should get rid of Tieguanyin now.
