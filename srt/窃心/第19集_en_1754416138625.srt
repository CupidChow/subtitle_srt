1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,600
travelled in several

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,360
则

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,360
which

4
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
yes

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
it

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,420
that is not

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,240
a

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,760
what

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,960
You broke into the private residence.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,360
Chu Nian,

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
stay away from her.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,680
She's with Tian Hua.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,400
Why are you still standing there?

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Take her away from the prison.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
You knew she was fake.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,040
It was fake just now,

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,160
but now it's real.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,880
Thanks to you, Xiaorou.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,800
Do you know this sachet

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,720
is on the body of Tian Hua's dead body?

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,920
Shen Mochen, you're scheming against me again.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,480
Wait.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,760
Mochen,

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
why don't you check your pocket?

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Is the sachet inside?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
I hope you can

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,280
take responsibility

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
and isolate yourself.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,640
I bought this sachet

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,520
for our director.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
It's not on the body of Tian Hua.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,520
It seems that it's a misunderstanding.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,880
Let's talk about the soldiers.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,120
Misunderstanding?

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,680
I said she was with Tian Hua.

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,160
She was with Tian Hua.

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Besides, she's already in a critical condition.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm going to find her for the people of the city.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,120
She's on a journey to the grave.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
If you get close to her,

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,280
you'll be executed.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I didn't touch her.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
I knew she was with Tian Hua.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
I reported it to the authorities immediately.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,680
I didn't touch her.

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,840
Xiaorou,

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
why did you do that?

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
You're back together with her.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,920
Do you expect me to die with you?

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,960
Director Shen,

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
arrest this pair of evil men and women.

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Shoot Gao Siye

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
and drag them out of the grave.

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,120
Chu Nian.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,440
Mochen Geng,

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
don't bet your life.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,400
You know

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,200
I can do anything for Siye.

59
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
Shoot.

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,640
Go.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,680
Go together.

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,080
He won't forgive you.

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,480
You go first.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,840
Chu Nian.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't shoot.

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,800
Chu Nian.

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,280
Chu Nian,

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,960
do you remember when you kidnapped me last time?

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Last time,

70
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,120
you wanted Lu Siye to die.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
This time,

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
you did it to save her.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
I don't know what's on your mind.

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,960
You know I don't want to hear you say sorry.

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,360
It seems you don't care about me at all.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,200
But for me,

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
I can only say sorry to you.

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,760
Chu Nian,

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,440
what do you like about Lu Siye?

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,440
You love her so much.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,520
But what about her?

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,000
She gave up on you without hesitation.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
She and Xiaorou are on the same side.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
She knows you won't hurt me.

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
You're always like this.

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
As long as it's about Lu Siye,

88
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,680
you'll lie to yourself.

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,080
Do you really love her that much?

90
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Go.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if you can escape to the end of the world,

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
you can't escape from my love.

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
You can't escape from me.

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,400
How do you feel?

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,760
It'll hurt.

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,800
Bear with it.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
It's not safe here anymore.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,160
Just go.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm not going.

100
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
I've lost you once.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,080
Even if I die this time,

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll be with you.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Wait for me here.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
I'll get some medicine.

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Lu Siye!

106
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Lu Siye, wake up.

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
What's wrong?

108
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Siye!

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,840
How do you feel?

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Let me help you up.

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
Don't touch me.

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,240
How could I leave you alone?

113
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Just go.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't leave.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,880
Wait here.

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,800
I'll get the medicine.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
סessions

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Come.

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,560
Slow down.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,220
Fine, 来,

121
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,520
Chairman!

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Cheng Tian.

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm here.

124
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Du Chuning.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Should I love you

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
or hate you?

127
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Do you know

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I really

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
love you?

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
You can't do that.

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Boss Gao.

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
You said you'd accepted

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
the wedding for your own son.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
But you're hiding it from me.

135
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
What?

136
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Are you afraid I'll be bad to your own son?

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm afraid you'll tell Mrs. Lu.

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
So what, Boss Kao?

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I thought you knew Gao Siyan,

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
and you didn't need me.

141
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
No matter how capable Siyan is,

142
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
I have to rely on you.

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I'm afraid you'll tell Mrs. Lu.

144
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm afraid you'll tell Mrs. Lu.

145
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm afraid you'll tell Mrs. Lu.

146
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
No matter how capable Siyan is,

147
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I have to rely on you.

148
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Director Shen, you know,

149
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
my wish has always been

150
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
to create a gentle fragrance like heaven.

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Now the gentle fragrance has been repaired and finished.

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It can open at any time.

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Although last time Siyan

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,800
was a little bit of a nag from Lu's family,

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
it's far from enough.

156
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
And Lin Chuning

157
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
protected the Yuying Bank.

158
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I have no money and no one.

159
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm very worried.

160
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I have an idea.

161
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I have an idea.

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Director Shen, please take care of her.

163
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Since your plane accident,

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
my parents have been working hard.

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You are their lifelong blood.

166
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
You are as kind as your parents.

167
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Boss Gao is very guilty.

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
The gentle fragrance he built

169
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
was destroyed by us.

170
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
If you don't believe me,

171
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
you can check the newspaper.

172
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
They have records.

173
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Wait for me here.

174
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Wait for me here.

175
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Why are you following me?

176
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Come on.

177
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Be careful.

178
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Lu Chuning.

179
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Siyan.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,800
This woman has been badmouthing us for many times.

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
If she doesn't come out,

182
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
we will have endless trouble.

183
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Dad.

184
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Dad.

188
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Let me do it.

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Siyan.

190
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Are you crazy?

191
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Kill him.

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Revenge for your unborn son.

193
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Lu Siyan.

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Don't worry.

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
You can make a decision after you see this.

196
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Don't listen to him.

197
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Siyan.

198
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Do you remember this?

199
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
You gave it to me.

200
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I won't forget this, okay?

201
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
If you kill him,

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
He will kill you one day.

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,640
Kill him!

204
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,440
Don't listen to him!

205
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,360
Lu Si Yan!

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm Gao Si Yan.

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,960
🎵Lun明既臼 Meiji

208
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm so glad

209
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,240
you did this for me.

210
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,480
🎵 Virtuous, holiness, proud

211
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,520
I don't understand, it's worth it

212
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,720
You are the hand of the moon, the hand of the wind

213
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,000
You have a pair of clear eyes

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
You are the red bean on the side, the heart of the dream

215
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,520
You want me to walk hand in hand, the heart of the horse

216
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,760
You are the poison in the flower, the poison in the mouth

217
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,040
You leave me to be the sweet and bitter

218
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,200
You are the spring wine that I drink

219
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,440
You are the moon, the moon is falling

220
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Looking back

221
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,840
My current identity is your daughter-in-law

222
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,640
Be careful of being discovered by Siyan

223
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,240
What are you afraid of?

224
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,240
Lin Chuning is dead

225
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
She can't go back

226
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Dad

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Siyan, you two talk first, I'm leaving

228
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Dad, this old man is sick, it hurts too much

229
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Sit

230
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Lu Chuning, clean up the mess

231
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Lu Chuning, is it all cleaned up?

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Of course, it's all cleaned up

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Tomorrow, you go back to the Lu family

234
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Once Lu Chuning dies, we can inherit the Lu family's business

235
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
It was originally ours

236
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Of course

237
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Dad

238
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,040
What exactly is in your box?

239
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Nothing, just some old things

240
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
The county governor is going to change his mind

241
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Dad, what do you have against your son?

242
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I have to know what you are putting in there

243
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I have to help you, right?

244
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
What do you think?

245
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I won't ask, I'm leaving

246
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Siyan

247
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Siyan

248
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Siyan

249
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Are you still angry about what happened before?

250
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I was just too angry because you were with Lu Chuning

251
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
That's why I did that

252
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm really worried about you

253
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Worried about me?

254
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
You have already reported it before you were killed

255
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
I was because

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
It doesn't matter

257
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
What is important?

258
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Lu Chuning?

259
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
But you have already killed her

260
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
You killed the person who loved you the most in this world

261
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
And the person you love the most

262
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
We don't have children at all

263
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I was lying to you before

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I'm not your wife at all

265
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
You never loved me at all

266
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Lu Chuning is the person you loved from the beginning

267
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
It's a pity

268
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I didn't see her die in your hands

269
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
But it doesn't matter

270
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm happy to see you suffer

271
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
You are crazy

272
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
What?

273
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
You want to hit me?

274
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Lu Chuning is dead now

275
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
You only have me

276
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Siyan

277
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Let's start over

278
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Okay?

279
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
I love you, Siyan

280
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
You are so disgusting

281
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I don't want to see you again

282
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Get away

283
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Siyan

284
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
I shot the person I loved the most

285
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
How can I face him?

286
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
You saw it too

287
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I really shot you

288
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm not the same person I used to be

289
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I'm Gao Siyan

290
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm stupid

291
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm not stupid

292
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I thought I could wake up

293
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I thought we could go back

294
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Maybe you weren't Lu Siyan

295
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
My Lu Siyan

296
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
He is dead

297
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I know

298
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I owe you

299
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
I'll return it to you

300
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
You think I won't?

301
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Shoot

302
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Gao Siyan

303
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I hate you

304
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
I'm sorry

305
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Chuning

306
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm sorry

307
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm not qualified to love you anymore

308
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
You hate me

309
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
I will solve everything as soon as possible

310
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I won't let anyone hurt you again

311
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Except me

312
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Dad

313
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
You drank so much

314
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Here, drink some water

315
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Siyan

316
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I'm happy today

317
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Come on

318
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Drink some

319
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
You have to drink if you are happy

320
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Ok, come on

321
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Cheers

322
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Dad

323
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
What's the matter?

324
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
You are so happy

325
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Siyan

326
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Do you know

327
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Your dad is smart

328
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Your dad has many voices

329
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Not only the fairy's power

330
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
So great

331
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I just don't know what else is there

332
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Dad's dream

333
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
To create a

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Man's paradise

335
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
So great

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Except the fairy's power

337
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
What else is there?

338
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Dad

339
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Then Wen Ruoxiang

340
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Is she also yours?

341
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Siyan

342
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
You are so smart

343
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I will tell you alone

344
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Wen Ruoxiang

345
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Is also mine

346
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Drink

347
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I heard that in your box

348
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
There are many new paintings

349
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
What is in the box?

350
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
In the box

351
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,040
There are beautiful girls

352
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Siyan

353
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Do you want

354
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Dad to take you inside

355
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
To play

356
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Ok

357
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Come on

358
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Cheers

359
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Cheers

360
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Dad

361
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Dad

362
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I am leaving

363
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Take your time

364
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
I am leaving

365
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I am leaving

366
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040

I am leaving

I am leaving

I am leaving

372

I am leaving

373
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I am leaving

374
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I am leaving

375
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
I am leaving
