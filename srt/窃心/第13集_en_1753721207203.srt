and he caught a cold

00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,500

It's all my fault.

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'll promise you everything when you wake up.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,160
God, please.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,640
Just let me go.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Don't hurt my son.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,640
Shen Mochen, you're a useless servant.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,640
Why haven't they found out who hurt my son?

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Si Yan, wake up, will you?

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Si Yan, you're awake.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
How are you? Does it hurt?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
You're back.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I think I feel like I'm awake when you cry.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Sorry, I hurt you again.

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
It's not your fault.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
As long as you're safe, I'm not a big deal.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Don't get hurt again, silly.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Don't be lonely for anyone else in the future.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
You're not someone else.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
You're my love.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Si Yan.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Si Yan, you're awake.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Are you okay?

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Go to the altar and tell your mother.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Si Yan, are you okay?

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Miss Lin, let me send you away.

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Otherwise, you won't be able to leave when they come.

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Miss Lin, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Please bless my son to be safe and well.

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Mrs. Lu, you've done so much to the Lu family.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
You even begged the ancestors of the Lu family for blessings.

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Aren't you afraid that the ancestors of the Lu family will come to you at night?

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
You should worry about yourself.

48
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I can send you away once, and I can send you away again.

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Mrs. Lu, you're threatening me.

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
So what?

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Mother.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Mother, what are you doing?

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Untie her.

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes.

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Si Yan.

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I told you not to touch her again.

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Are you going to force me to die?

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Si Yan, how's your wound?

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
How are you?

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you okay?

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm fine.

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Mother.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Why don't you rest?

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Don't touch her again.

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Si Yan.

66
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Xiaorou, why are you here?

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Chuning, didn't father tell you that this position is mine?

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I forgot.

69
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Father doesn't want to see you anymore.

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
This paper is from Si Yan, right?

71
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Give it to me.

72
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Lin Chuning, your final ending will be the same as this paper.

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
You're stepping on my feet.

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Xiaorou, are you crazy?

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Do you know what you're talking about?

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Of course I know.

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
How did you become like this?

78
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I've always been like this.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
It's just that you don't know.

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Seeing you like this now, I really regret it.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Regret saving me?

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
This way you can continue to occupy Quechao and take my position, right?

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I can save anyone who changes to Yu Ying Tang.

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I regret that our sisterhood for so many years is fake.

85
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I thought we were the same.

86
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Same?

87
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
We're not the same at all.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm Qianji, you're Jian...

89
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Xiaorou, you'd better remember what you said today.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I'll be back.

91
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Lin Chuning, this is mine.

92
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Aren't you the noble Miss Lu?

93
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
How did you end up in this world?

94
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I thought it was a phoenix, but it was a wild chicken.

95
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
You hit me again.

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
What? One slap is not enough?

97
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Then another slap.

98
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Stop.

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
This is the Lu family, not your Yu Ying Tang.

100
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Did I tell you to leave?

101
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I lost something.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
You lost something and went to look for it.

103
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
But you were the only one who entered my office.

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Is this the only skill of the Lu family?

105
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Marry her and search for her.

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Who dares to come?

107
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Let go.

108
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
No.

109
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I said you stole it.

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
How dare you say that?

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Everyone, look at me.

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I'm the Miss Lu.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
If someone offends me,

114
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
then it's offending the whole Lu family.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
You can resign.

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
You can also fight back.

117
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
But I can guarantee that

118
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
if you do this,

119
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
there will be no more white-trade companies in the city

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
who dare to use you.

121
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Tonight, Lu's Group is going to hold a charity auction.

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Lin Chuning, I'll let you clean this place up in two hours.

123
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
No one is allowed to help.

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Be careful.

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I want to do it too.

126
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I want to do it too.

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
What are you thinking?

128
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Why are you laughing so happily?

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm thinking...

130
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
What do you think it feels like to kiss someone?

131
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I saw a couple on the street today.

132
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I kissed them right away.

133
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Good, Xiaorou.

134
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Turn around.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
What do you think it feels like?

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
What are you doing?

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Didn't you say that?

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
What do you think it feels like to kiss someone?

139
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
What do you think it feels like?

140
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I won't tell you.

141
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Thank you very much.

142
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Thank you.

143
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Xiaorou, why are you laughing?

144
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
If it weren't for you,

145
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
you wouldn't have cared about our sisterhood.

146
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
How could you have woken up?

147
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
So, the first auction today

148
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
is a treasure donated by me.

149
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Next, my daughter will show you this nishan clothes.

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
This is the nishan clothes.

151
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Everyone,

152
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
she was sewed by Ming family

153
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
for three months.

154
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Is it a lie to take a shabby dress here?

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Are these things all fake?

156
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
What's this?

157
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Everyone, you may not know,

158
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
this is

159
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
what Master Lu intended to do.

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Lin Chu Niang?

161
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
This dress

162
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
is very expensive and gorgeous.

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
If you don't take good care of it,

164
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
it will be like this.

165
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
My father asked me to sew it

166
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
to tell everyone

167
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
that our family is now

168
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
in a storm.

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Only by uniting and working together

170
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
can we make it shine again.

171
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
The flowers are in full bloom

172
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
and the snow is falling.

173
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I hope you will give me your support.

174
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
This person is really...

175
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
That model is definitely not a lady from Luo family.

176
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Her temperament is clear.

177
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
She doesn't look like a prince in a dragon robe.

178
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Master Lu only said that

179
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
the one who shows the nishan clothes is her daughter.

180
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
He didn't say that the one who wears the nishan clothes is his daughter.

181
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
But this...

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Everyone,

183
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
now, the auction is officially started.

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
The starting price is 10,000 yuan.

185
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll give you 10,000 yuan.

186
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
10,000 yuan.

187
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Master Lu,

188
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
last time I let you get your life back.

189
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I don't believe you still have this good luck.

190
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
How did he get off the car of Siyan?

191
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
My father's legs are not comfortable.

192
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
You go and drive the car to the entrance.

193
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Okay, I'll go right now.

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Father,

195
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm going to the market.

196
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Father, your car seems to have some problems.

197
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Siyan said to let you take his car back.

198
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Okay.

199
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Chuning,

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
you push me to the road.

201
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I have something to talk to you.

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay.

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Father, slow down.

204
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Chuning,

205
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I'll leave my father to you.

206
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Don't worry.

207
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I take care of my father better than you.

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Drive slowly.

209
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Lin Chuning,

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,200
you have to take good care of your father when you get there.

212
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Okay.

213
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Where's the car?

214
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Master, how did I see Miss Lin take your car back?

215
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
My car?

216
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Yes.

217
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I'll go to the market.

218
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
You've been kicked out of the Lu family.

219
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Why are you still defending the Lu family?

220
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,200
I have to get up from where I fell.

221
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
You all look down on me.

222
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I have to prove to you that my ability has nothing to do with the Lu family's daughter.

223
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I will announce that

224
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I've been sick since I was a child.

225
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
You're my goddaughter who I brought back to the Lu family to help me get back my blood.

226
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
You can stay in the Lu family.

227
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Thank you, Master Lu.

228
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Don't disappoint me.

229
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Lu Si Yan,

230
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
only by killing you

231
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
can I get what I want,

232
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
including Chuning,

233
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
including the Lu family.

234
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
So you have to die.

235
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Here.

236
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Dad!

237
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Chuning!

238
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Dad!

239
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Chuning!

240
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Master, how is she?

241
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Is she hurt?

242
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Don't touch me.

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Save your dad.

244
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I'm fine.

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm fine.

246
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm fine.

247
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm fine.

248
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm fine.

249
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Dad.

250
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
It's my fault that I didn't protect Master Lu.

252
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I should be the one to say sorry.

253
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
It's me.

254
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I didn't protect you well.

255
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Master!

256
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Master!

257
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Master!

258
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Lin Chuning!

259
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
If it wasn't for you,

260
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Master wouldn't have been hurt!

261
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I don't allow you to say that.

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
She is more sad than anyone else.

263
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Please calm down.

264
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
She is bleeding.

265
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Please come and check her blood.

266
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I'll do it.

267
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Si Yan.

268
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
It's okay. I'll be right back.

269
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Does it hurt?

270
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm fine.

271
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I thought you were in the car.

272
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I thought if something happened to you,

273
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I wouldn't want to live.

274
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Don't say that.

275
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm fine.

276
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
How is Master Lu?

277
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I just gave her blood.

278
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
She should be fine now.

279
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
That's good.

280
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
He Niang is so rude.

281
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I can't stand her.

282
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Don't talk to her.

283
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
She cares about Master Lu.

284
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
If I hurt someone I care about,

285
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm worse than her.

286
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Here.

287
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
What's this?

288
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
It's a birthmark.

289
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I used a powder to cover it

290
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
to pretend to be Xiaorou.

291
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Is she my daughter?

292
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Mother.

293
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Mrs. Lu.

294
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Mother. I told you not to touch her.

295
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
What's wrong?

298
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
You...

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
How did you develop?

300
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I'll tell you the truth.

301
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I won't marry her.

302
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
No!

303
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Unless I die,

304
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
you'll never be together.

305
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Mrs. Lu.

306
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
What do you want?

307
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Wind and water are the same.

308
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
This world owes me.

309
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
You owe me.

310
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I want to get it back.

311
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I want to get it back.

312
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Chuning.

313
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Your birthmark is so special.

314
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
If you like it,

315
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I can draw it for you.

316
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
You drew it?

317
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
My mother wore it.

318
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
But my mother

319
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
doesn't want it.

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
No.

321
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Your mother left you a mark.

322
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
You can go back and find it.

323
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Mother.

324
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm sorry.

327
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm sorry.

337
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm sorry.

341
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm sorry.

345
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm sorry.

348
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm sorry.

350
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm sorry.

355
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm sorry.

363
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I'm sorry.

378
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
