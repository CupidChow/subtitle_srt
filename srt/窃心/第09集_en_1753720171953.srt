1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
little bit of a

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
little bit of

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a little bit of a

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,040
a

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
little bit of

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,000
a little bit of

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're so beautiful.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How can I let you down?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The final Part

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Cui Qingxiang?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Madam, you've prepared two dishes.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Not only did you prepare the wine for the Lord,

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you also ordered Cui Qingxiang for the Lady.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The Lady and the Lord must have enjoyed it.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sure they will like it.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please watch the show.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The Lady and the Lord

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Lady and the Lord

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Siye.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you doing?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Get out.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Siye.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you looking for me?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not looking for you. Get out.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Siye.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh no.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cui Qingxiang?

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Siye, how are you?

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I told you to get out.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Get out. Get out. Get out.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you okay?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Lin Chuning, I told you to get out.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Siye.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let me go.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I just saw Gao Yuanfeng

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
sneak into Chuning's workshop.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm afraid Gao Yuanfeng will be angry

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and hurt Chuning.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Where is Siye?

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've already sent someone to look for her.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you crazy?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm crazy.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Lin Chuning.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let me go.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't control myself.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't control myself.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Lu Siye.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Lu Siye.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Lu Siye, wake up.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Lu Siye.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Lu Siye.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Lu Siye.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Lu Siye, wake up.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Lu Siye.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They just want to get away.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't let them get away.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't let them get away.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't let them get away.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lu Siye.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let me go.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let me go.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Lu Siye.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Lu Siye.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Lu Siye.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Brother.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Brother.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Long Live experts.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If I tell you now

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
not to be afraid of test matter anymore,

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
don't worry.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We will hear everything.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You must protect and protect

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let me go.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ically.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
It's me, it's all my fault

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't say it

103
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Even if there's a life, it's a life

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Even if we're born together, we can't escape

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Lu Si Yan

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,800
Even if we're born together, we can't escape

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,400
I hope you can forget me

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Dad, mom, why are you here?

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why are you alone?

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is there someone else?

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I saw it clearly

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Dad, I'm a client

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Our jade mold is not easy to store

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm thinking if we should add a re-enactment process

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know this?

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I did everything to survive

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, then you're in charge of this

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then I'll let them move everything out

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You guys move all this out

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wait

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's going on?

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong?

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Nothing

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was wrong

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mom, why aren't you leaving?

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you know what to do?

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Si Yan

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't come over

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm worried about you

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then don't come over

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Are you okay, Si Yan?

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't come over

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The sea of the unknown in the roadside

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The roadside is full of the sound of waves

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The sound of waves

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The sound of waves

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The sound of waves

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The sound of waves

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The sound of waves

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Si Yan

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm worried about you

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm worried about you

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're making me...

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then let me...

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me forget about you

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I gave you a chance

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you don't listen, don't think about it

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Stop talking nonsense

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want you to be happy

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can't do this

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We can't do this

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You go

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How do you know I'm not...

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sexy

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Madam said you lived too long

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're not my brother

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Li Shuntian

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're hurt

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's not my blood

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Madam

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I just made a mistake

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Useless

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Find a place to hide

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't let anyone find out

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Da Cong

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Call everyone here

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
See who's got a wound on their chest

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's useless to find it

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Even a woman can't kill

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mom, do you know they're...

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Shut up

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What do you mean?

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Send Miss Jiang to Zhengyu School

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Learn from Furong

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mom

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Go

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mom, I'm not going

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mom, I know I made a mistake

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm not going to Zhengyu School

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mom, Lu Yujin should be taught

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But not to Zhengyu School

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
In this age

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's not good to teach women those things

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you soft on him?

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Of course not

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Deputy Chief

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're so kind

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Please forgive her

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't investigate anymore

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Mom

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You mean

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
My sister wants to kill me

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Chuning

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The school will teach your sister well

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She won't do it again

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Since mom said so

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll forgive her this time

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're my good daughter

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll sleep with you tonight

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We can talk

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mom

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I hope you can

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Protect Chuning

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I won't hurt her

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay?

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A'Cong

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Stay outside the house tonight

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Shoot me if you see anything

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is anyone here?

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Open the door

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mochun

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're finally here

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Are you okay?

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've knocked your people out

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You don't have to go to Zhengyu School

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Stay here

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If my mom finds out I'm not here

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You'll be in trouble if you find out

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't worry

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
To prevent any accident

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You should thank your family

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll send someone to Lu's house

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So you can rest in peace

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're the best

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Chuning

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The whole city is here

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Help me find the right girl

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Mom

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Help your brother find a wife

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Miss Li is good

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
She's a good girl

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
She's pretty

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Miss Zhang is good too

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
She's gentle

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
She's good for your brother

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll choose the right one

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're engaged

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your brother should get married

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I just want my children to get married

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mom, what's wrong?

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Nothing

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm old

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll tell my brother to vote for her

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is the sun

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll help you to relieve your headache

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He's a good boy

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What a pity

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How was your rest last night?

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You don't want to talk to me?

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you don't want to talk to me

261
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll give you this

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Give me a hug

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You should keep the flowers

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
For your Miss Li and Miss Chen

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Who are you talking about?

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Your boyfriend

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you jealous?

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No

269
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It doesn't matter

270
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I only have one Miss Li in my heart

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Miss Chen and Miss Zhang

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When you and Xiaorou get married

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll confess to my parents

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If I can't be their daughter

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll be their daughter-in-law

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But your mother hates me so much

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How could she accept me as her daughter-in-law?

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It doesn't matter

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I warned them last night

280
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
They dare not to talk to me again

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The most important thing is

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're mine

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
As long as you accept me

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's enough

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I've discussed with my father

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Then

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We'll hold a wedding in Xianli City

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I've been visiting Xiaorou recently

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Every Wednesday and Friday

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can apply the powder in the golden cage

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Every night, Boss Gao will put the peacock out of the cage

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll watch the peacock perform

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Boss Gao's good days

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Are coming to an end

296
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can you eat this?

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Try one

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Is it good?

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You eat

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want it

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Not this

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Director Shen and Miss Lu

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You're a match made in heaven

304
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Boss Gao and Young Master Gu

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You two are a match made in heaven

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're a match made in heaven

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Really?

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This lady has a good taste

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They've been together for a long time

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And they still have a good relationship

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Besides, Zi Yan and Gao Daguo

312
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They've lived together for 20 years

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They look alike

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's normal

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Father, I have something to do

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll go first

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Go

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The peacock Boss Gao raised is so beautiful

319
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It must have cost a lot

321
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Fire!

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Fire!

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Run!

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Don't run!

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Get out of the way!

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hurry up!

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Fire!

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Fire!

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Run!

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Fire!

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Fire!

332
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You go to the accountant and I'll go to Xiaorou

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Hurry up!

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Xiaorou

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Xiaorou

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Xiaorou

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Xiaorou

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This way

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, I'll take you out

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I found it

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's go

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Take me out, OK?

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Take Xiaorou out

344
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We go together

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, I'm late

346
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We'll all die here

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Take her out

348
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Take me out

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Remember, don't go out

350
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Be careful

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The road is dark

352
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because of your unknown

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The whole world is lonely

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You are passing

355
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The dark corner

356
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The fog is not close

357
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The sea is still

359
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Your hand

360
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Flowing near the star

361
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We met countless times

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We met countless times

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's hard to get

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's hard to get

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The strong old

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Leave it to yourself

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I

368
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't care about you

369
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If the sea

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Your back

371
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The sky is not a fake

372
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I care

373
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I am not a cloud

374
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Have you ever

375
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If love

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Like a dream

377
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Like a cloud

378
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
In the dream

379
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'd like to

380
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'd like to be in your arms

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
In the unknown

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The sea

383
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The whole world is lonely

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You are passing

385
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The dark corner

386
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The fog is not close

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The sea is still

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Your hand

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Flowing near the star

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We met countless times

392
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We met countless times

393
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's hard to get

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The strong old

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Leave it to yourself

396
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I

397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't care about you

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If the sea

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Your back

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The sky is not a fake

401
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I care

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I am not a cloud

403
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Have you ever

404
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If love

405
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Like a dream

406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Like a cloud

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
In the dream

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'd like to

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'd like to be in your arms

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
In the unknown

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The night wind

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I miss you

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'd like to

414
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'd like to

415
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'd like to be

416
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
In the middle of the sea

417
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If love

418
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Like a dream

419
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The sky is not a fake

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The wind

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The wind
