Let's go them together

Let's go

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,440
Ok

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,300
Give it back

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,900
Here

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,420
It's too dark

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,000
No

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I like what you said just now.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm very rich.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,640
I want you to have this kind of relationship forever.

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
So, Miss Lin Chuning,

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
are you willing to marry Mr. Su Si Yuan?

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Yes.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Look.

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
I never thought I could spend my whole life with someone.

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,640
But if this person is you, I'm willing to.

22
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Not only for life,

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
I also want your next life.

24
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
For life, for life.

25
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
I want to marry you.

26
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Brother Mo Chen,

27
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I came here today to tell you that we should get a divorce.

28
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I don't agree.

29
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Chuning, you should know that I like you first.

30
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
There is nothing in love that is too late.

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Chuning, what is so good about Lu Si Yan?

32
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,640
If there is no Lu Jing, he is nothing.

33
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
What is so good about him?

34
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Chuning, you should know that I saved you when Gao Laobao wanted to kill you.

35
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
And now I'm a hero that everyone calls me.

36
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
But you still don't like me.

37
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Why?

38
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Brother Mo Chen, do you want to kill Gao Laobao or save me?

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
You know it very well.

40
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Brother Mo Chen, you should do it yourself.

41
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Chuning, Chuning, Chuning.

42
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Chuning.

43
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Chuning, you will regret it.

44
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
You will regret it.

45
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Do you think I can find you and love you again with this birthmark in the next life?

46
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Then you have to protect it.

47
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
If it's gone, I won't recognize you.

48
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Then you wait.

49
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I can just put it on my body.

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Then it won't come off.

51
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
There is no need to put it on your body.

52
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
What are you thinking about?

53
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm thinking about where Shen Mo Chen hid those girls.

54
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,640
By the way, the doctor asked us to go to the hospital tomorrow.

55
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
We can try it.

56
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Sure.

57
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
You are giving me flowers.

58
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
It's okay.

59
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Flowers are very beautiful.

60
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm not tired.

61
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Then I'll ask one.

62
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Okay.

63
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Okay, hug.

64
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
It's very hot.

65
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
It's very hot to hug.

66
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Why hasn't Chuning come yet?

67
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
She should be coming soon.

68
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Wait a minute.

69
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Mr. Lu, I'll give you a toast.

70
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
If it weren't for you and Chuning, and Director Shen,

71
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm afraid we sisters will never escape Boss Gao's trap.

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Thank you.

73
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Thank you too.

74
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm willing to stand out.

75
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Thank you.

76
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Mr. Lu, actually in the tender fragrance,

77
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
the first time I saw you,

78
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I fell in love with you.

79
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
You gave me freedom.

80
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
If you don't dislike me,

81
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm willing to give myself to you.

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm grateful to you.

83
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Don't you know Chuning is my lover?

84
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
I can be your concubine.

85
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
If you are saying these words today,

86
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I don't have to eat this meal.

87
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
You saw it all.

88
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,640
You let me test the feelings of Mr. Lu for Chuning.

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Now you can rest assured.

90
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Mr. Lu has a deep love for Chuning.

91
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
But why did you make me faint?

92
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Caiyi,

93
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,640
do you want to know why I fainted?

94
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I'll tell you.

95
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Lin Chuning,

96
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
even if Lu Si Yan dies,

97
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm afraid you still love him so much.

98
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Then I'll make you hate him completely.

99
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Recently, several girls have been missing

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
in the police station.

102
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Chuning, you must be careful when you go out.

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Isn't Boss Gao dead?

104
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Why are there still girls missing?

105
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
The bad guys in this world

106
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
are not only Boss Gao.

107
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Does the murderer have a clue?

108
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Don't worry.

109
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I've already dispatched the whole police station to investigate.

110
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Si Yan.

111
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Mo Chen,

112
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
I want to see Si Yan.

113
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
There must be a grudge between them.

114
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I want to ask him personally.

115
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Listen to me.

116
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Chuning,

117
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
you trust Lu Si Yan too much.

118
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Men are like this.

119
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Once they get it, they don't know how to cherish it.

120
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
The wild flowers outside are always fragrant.

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Caiyi is Boss Gao's prey.

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Lu Si Yan forced him to do it.

123
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
He was afraid that he would kill him.

124
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
If he doesn't kill him,

125
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
it's not enough to make a name for himself.

126
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I want to see Caiyi.

127
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Let me see him off.

128
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay.

129
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll take you there.

130
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Caiyi.

131
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Rest in peace.

132
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I will.

133
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
I will.

134
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
I will.

135
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I will.

136
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Money is money.

137
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
There are projects for the blind.

138
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
What kind of woman doesn't have one?

139
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Who would do such a thing?

140
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Don't be angry.

141
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
He used to be a handsome young man.

142
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
I heard that he was a gentle and fragrant passenger.

143
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I will execute the criminal's robbery today.

144
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Leave Lin Chuning to me.

145
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
You can go.

146
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Wait.

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I have evidence.

148
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
The murderer is someone else.

149
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
What?

150
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Before Caiyi died,

151
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
he took off the button on the murderer's clothes.

152
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,640
The pattern of this button is made by the police uniform.

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Every uniform is recorded in the case.

154
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
As long as you find a police officer who is missing a button,

155
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
the murderer is the murderer.

156
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Chief Shen.

157
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
The murderer is among you.

158
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
He is among you.

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Is he really a family member?

160
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
This criminal is not Lu Siyuan.

161
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Chief Shen.

162
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I hope you can report to the police.

163
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Don't cover up the criminal.

164
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
You are so kind.

165
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
I thought you were a couple.

166
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Lin Chuning.

167
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Who knows if you are covering up the criminal

168
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
for your brother.

169
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
You are covering up the criminal.

170
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
It seems that Lin Chuning didn't go back to the Lu family.

171
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
They were still in a good relationship for a while.

172
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Lin Chuning is a prostitute.

173
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
She should be imprisoned.

174
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
What kind of prostitute is she?

175
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
She is a prostitute.

176
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Kill her.

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Don't make a fuss.

178
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
A prostitute.

179
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
A prostitute.

180
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Kill her.

181
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Kill her.

182
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Kill her.

183
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
You are not my sister.

184
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Don't make a fuss.

185
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Stop it.

186
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
They are not sisters.

187
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
He is actually the son of Boss Gao.

188
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Boss Gao.

189
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Shen Mochen.

190
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Boss Gao.

191
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
He is the one who built the gentle incense

192
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
and killed countless girls.

193
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
He is really a great man.

194
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
The son of a rat will be moved.

195
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
My daughter disappeared a few days ago.

196
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Gao Siyuan, did you do it?

197
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Give my daughter back.

198
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
You must kill him for the sake of the people.

199
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Kill him.

200
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Kill him.

201
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Kill him.

202
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Kill him.

203
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Kill him.

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Kill him.

205
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Kill him.

206
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Kill him.

207
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Kill him.

208
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
What's going on?

209
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Where is this place?

210
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Run.

211
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Run.

212
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Run.

213
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Run.

214
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Run.

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Run.

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
The execution ground of the Pinyuan Street.

217
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Everyone, prepare to be killed.

218
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
What's going on?

219
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Run.

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Run.

221
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Run.

222
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Although he is not my son,

223
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I actually learned about it from the newspaper.

224
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
If it wasn't for this kind of thing,

225
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,640
when are you going to lie to me?

226
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
That bastard Gao Yuanfeng

227
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
let my maid go and made her pregnant.

228
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Later, I didn't give birth to Lin'er.

229
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I was afraid that you wouldn't want me, so...

230
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Mochen,

231
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
why did you bring so many people here?

232
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Are you afraid that I will hide the fugitives in Lu's mansion?

233
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Of course not.

234
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Now, Lu Siyan's identity has been exposed.

235
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
He has become a rat and everyone is beating him.

236
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm afraid that he is not good to his parents.

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
He is protecting the Lu family.

238
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Keep a close watch on him for 24 hours.

239
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Once you find Lu Siyan, kill him.

240
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Yes.

241
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I didn't expect that he would be more heartbroken than Boss Gao.

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
He tried his best to kill Siyan.

243
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Only by saving those missing girls

244
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
can he return Siyan's innocence and the world's peace.

245
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Don't worry.

246
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I'm going to gain his trust soon.

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Thank you.

248
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Lu Siyan

249
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Father, Mother,

250
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Siyan, what's going on?

252
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I didn't kill anyone.

253
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
I didn't kidnap the girls.

254
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I trust you.

255
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Of course I trust you.

256
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Father,

257
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't know

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
if you still want to recognize me.

259
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
But now the whole family

260
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
is under Shen Bochen's control.

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
To protect you,

262
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I have to pretend to cut ties with you.

263
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Someone is here.

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Siyan, go.

265
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
I don't have a son like you.

266
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
From now on, you and I are even.

267
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Lu Siyan

268
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Master, Young Master is in Master and Madam's room.

269
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
You stay here.

270
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
I'll go in and have a look.

271
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Siyan,

272
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
you taught me for more than 20 years.

273
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
In my heart,

274
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
you are my son.

275
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Where is Lu Siyan?

276
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I don't know.

277
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Xue Fu.

278
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Siyan,

279
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
protect yourself.

280
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
I will protect the Lu family

281
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
and protect everything.

282
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Chunniang.

283
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Mocheng,

284
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
what's wrong?

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Chunniang,

286
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
you are safe.

287
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
I'll be like this when I come in.

288
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Father, father, father.

289
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Siyan, father, wake up.

290
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Father, father.

291
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Mother, mother, mother.

292
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Chunniang, Chunniang.

293
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Mother, mother, I haven't forgiven you yet.

294
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Why, why did you abandon me again?

295
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Chunniang, why did you abandon me?

296
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Why did this happen?

297
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Why did this happen?

298
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
How did it become like this?

299
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Who killed them?

300
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Who killed them?

301
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
From the wound,

302
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
the murderer is a master of knife.

303
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
He was killed with one stab.

304
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Knife?

305
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Say it again.

306
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Master and Master seem to have a dispute.

307
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Master said he would cut off the father-son relationship with him.

308
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
What did you say?

309
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
It's Siyan.

310
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Siyan.

311
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Chunniang.

312
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Impossible.

313
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
It must be because Siyan was angry with him.

314
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
He killed your parents with one blow.

315
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Impossible.

316
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Impossible.

317
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Siyan wouldn't do that.

318
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
How could it be him?

319
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Siyan, it's impossible.

320
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
He could even push his own father out of the wall.

321
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Not to mention raising his parents.

322
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Chunniang,

323
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
I told you before

324
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
that Lu Siyan is not a good person.

325
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Recently, the young girl has been missing.

326
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
After I investigated,

327
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
I found out that Lu Siyan was the mastermind behind Wen Rousheng.

328
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
And Boss Gao

329
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
was just a scapegoat for him.

330
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Impossible.

331
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
It's impossible.

332
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
How could he do that?

333
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
How could he do that?

334
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
His dream is to protect the people.

335
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
How could he do that?

336
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I don't believe it.

337
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
He told you all that, Chunniang.

338
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Think about it.

339
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
If he had really been destroyed by the plane,

340
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
how could he be safe?

341
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Those were just his tricks.

342
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
And he was behind it.

343
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
He was in charge of everything.

344
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Chunniang,

345
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
how could he do that

346
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
to you?

347
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
I really care about you.

348
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Do you know that?

349
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Impossible.

350
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
He wouldn't kill them.

351
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Impossible.

352
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
The book he gave you was fake.

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
This is the real one.

354
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
He wanted to distract us.

355
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
He wanted to make you feel dizzy.

356
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
I really care about you.

357
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Lu Siyan.

358
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Lu Siyan.

359
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Lu Siyan.

360
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Miss,

361
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
a gentleman asked me to give this to you.

362
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Chunniang,

363
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
I knew you would come to see me.

364
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Don't come any closer.

365
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Chunniang,

366
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
what's wrong?

367
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Lu Siyan,

368
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
you actually dared to kill my parents!

369
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
What are you talking about?

370
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
You're still pretending?

371
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Chunniang.

372
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm here.

373
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
You're still pretending?

374
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm here.

375
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
What did you say?

376
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
You're still pretending!

377
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I still roll your back

378
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,640
As a fake

379
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm still dreaming

380
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Have you ever had a story

381
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,640
If love is like a dream, it's like a retribution

382
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,640
In the dream, I'm like a shadow

383
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I'd like to be in your arms

384
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
I'm still dreaming

385
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Have you ever had a story

386
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
If love is like a dream, it's like a retribution

387
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
In the dream, I'm like a shadow

388
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,640
I'd like to be in your arms

389
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
I'd like to be in your arms

390
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
I'm still dreaming

391
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Have you ever had a story

392
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Like a fallen leaf

393
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,640
The floating rain on the beach

394
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
No one cares

395
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,640
A long old dream for myself

396
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I have nothing to do with you

397
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,640
If love is like a shadow

398
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
As a fake

399
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
I'm still dreaming

400
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Have you ever had a story

401
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
If love is like a dream, it's like a retribution

402
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
In the dream, I'm like a shadow

403
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,640
I'd like to be in your arms

404
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,640
I'm still dreaming

405
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Have you ever had a story

406
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,640
I'd like to be a love that symbolizes the sea

407
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,640
If love is like a rain in the evening

408
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,640
No one cares

409
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,640
A long old dream for myself

410
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Thanks for watching!
