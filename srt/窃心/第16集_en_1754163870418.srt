1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,760
foreign

2
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
foreign

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait a minute.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Si Yan, I know you've been by my side all this time,

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and you've been protecting me.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You promised to keep your promise.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How can you ask me to let go of you?

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've asked the Hong Kong school.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lu Si Yan didn't go to Hong Kong to study.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not only that,

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
he's also the first pilot of the aviation school.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now he's the Air Force's young school.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No wonder I always feel that he and Lin Chu have some secret.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now they're in the same place,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but their sister's identity is also an unavoidable red light.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But it doesn't matter.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They look at each other, but they can't get along.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's more torturing than seeing them together.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What if they're not real siblings?

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you mean?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In the past, Mrs. Lu changed the Crown Prince for the sake of the throne.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lu Si Yan is not the son of the Lu family.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He has nothing to do with Lin Chu Ning.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I advise you to cook the rice in advance.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Give birth to a child and hold him with your child.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Otherwise, when they know the truth,

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you'll be in trouble.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lu Si Yan finally caught you.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you find out who the real bastard is,

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will make you and Lin Chu Ning lose your life.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You go back first.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to walk around alone.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How can I?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Young Master told me to keep you safe.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Otherwise, I can't eat and walk around.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lin Chu Ning.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You little bastard.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You've got me in a tight spot.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Without Si Yan, who else would...

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Si Yan.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why are you here?

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Did I warn you to stay away from Lin Chu Ning?

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He is soft-hearted, but I'm different.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll kill you.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm your father, Si Yan.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Uncle, even if my father is here,

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
he can't save you.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Si Yan, I'm your real father.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let me explain.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your mother is not your real mother.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Your real mother is your mother's maid.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I had a relationship with her, so I had you.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your mother killed her mother many times to stabilize her position.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you don't believe me, you can confront your mother.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You think I believe you?

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Si Yan.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Si Yan.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No wonder people say we look alike.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just found out that we are real father and son.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Lu family killed your mother.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Si Yan, we've been deceived by them for so long.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You must avenge them.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let them feel the separation of family.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You don't deserve to be a man.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You don't deserve to be a father.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can never make me deal with Lu family.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Lu family

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Chunni, maybe we are not real father and son.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Maybe we are still possible.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm so nervous.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait for me.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wait for me.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hurry up.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Move.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Come on.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hurry up.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Si Yan, you left so quickly yesterday.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Nothing will happen.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Lu family's market share of this season is increasing.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Chunni.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll do my best to protect your brother and family.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When you get married, I'll prepare a generous dowry for you.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yan, don't talk about work when you eat.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Chunni has been on sale for these ten days.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Si Yan said you like chestnuts.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Have a taste.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is chestnut cake made by me.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you, mother.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Father.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Any news about Si Yan?

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Not yet.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Si Yan just woke up yesterday.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He said everything was fine and he would come back at the end of the year.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's the first reunion year for all four of us.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Miss, someone is looking for you.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They say you are his classmate.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Miss, please.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Air Force Major Lu Si Yan.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He has been on duty for ten months.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was destroyed by the plane.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He was sacrificed.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What?

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Si Yan went to school.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Miss Lin.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Our plane has no way to fly.

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If we get stronger,

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
every flight

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
will be a life-or-death experience.

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But to get the hang of the plane,

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we must do it.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We must make our plane fall into the city of Si Yan.

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We must not let the enemy fall into the battlefield.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Maybe

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
he is not dead.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The plane exploded in the air.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The man has been burned to ashes.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What did you say?

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We will try our best to find Si Yan.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What did you say?

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There is no body.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There is no body.

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why did you say he was dead?

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We have no choice.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He will not die.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He said

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
he would come back to see me.

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He said he would protect me for the rest of my life.

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He will not die.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Miss Lin.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Every time we carry out a mission,

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we will leave a will.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let me give it to you.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Chunni.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you see this letter,

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it means I have

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
stayed in the blue sky.

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't be sad.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I am just a part of my dream.

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This life is short.

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Because of you,

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
there are fireworks.

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So even if I can only be a spy,

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
please continue to meet me

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
in the next life.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Forget it.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
As long as you are happy,

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I still like you.

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will always be with you.

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
As long as you are happy,

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I still like you.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The way you smile.

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am sorry.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Before,

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
now,

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and in the future.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If possible,

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I love you.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Before,

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
now,

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and in the future.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I miss you so much.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If I knew it would end like this,

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I shouldn't have brought you back.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
At least,

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you can be safe.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Chunni.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Actually, I only had you at that time.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I killed Ziyan with my maid.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
At that time,

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
your father just took over the business.

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I didn't have a son,

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the current Lu's madam

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
wouldn't have been me.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Madam.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have a daughter.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Baozong.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I wanted a son,

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but I had a daughter.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How are the people next door?

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Madam, how are you?

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Boy and girl.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There are still some who are not yet married.

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's hard to produce.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then give them a village to produce medicine.

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Until they have a son.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm afraid it will kill people.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not afraid.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They are just a group of scoundrels.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you afraid of?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
When the old man returns to the front,

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
this is my best chance.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Tell them,

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
as long as they have a son,

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
they will be rich and rich for a lifetime.

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If they can't give birth,

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the old man will definitely divorce me.

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Madam said,

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
as long as you can have a son,

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
she will keep you rich and rich for a lifetime.

204
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Drink all the medicine in your hands.

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Go in first.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Congratulations, Madam.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You have a son.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't cry.

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Give this to her.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Maybe the people who saw her

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
can treat her better.

212
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Take them away.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Take them away.

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And the women next door.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You have to take care of them.

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want anyone

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to know about my son's bad words.

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes.

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What did you say?

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So,

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
when you were born,

222
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you were afraid of your position

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and abandoned me.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When I returned to the Lu family,

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you were afraid that

226
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
your scandal would be exposed

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and you would kill me again and again.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't touch me.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you know

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that because of you,

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Siyan and I have been ruined by you?

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Siyan,

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we can enjoy it.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come back.

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come back.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Come back.

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The End

239
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Siyan,

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
have a good year.

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Have a good year.

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm back.

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Siyan.

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm so happy.

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Me too.

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
After we come back,

247
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
let's be together

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and never separate again.

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay?

250
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
After we come back,

251
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
let's be together

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and never separate again.

253
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay?

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay?

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay?

256
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay?

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay?

258
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay?

259
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay?

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay?

261
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay?

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay?

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay?

264
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay?

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay?

266
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay?

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay?

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I hope you like the man who can be with you.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The one who is loyal will never think about it.

277
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Miss, someone saw Gao Yunfang in the east city today.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Look at my makeup. How is it?

279
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Director Shen, I recovered the same as before.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Are you satisfied?

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Boss Kang, you are the boss behind Wenrou Xiang.

282
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No matter how much you earn, it has nothing to do with me.

283
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Director Shen, I owe you a lot.

284
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't understand what you are talking about.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Director Shen, please keep the land for me.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Boss Kang, don't worry.

287
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wenrou Xiang's future is in my hands.

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Director Shen, you are so wise.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Gao Yunfang is still alive.

290
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He disappeared after Wenrou Xiang was destroyed.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't think he can hide this time.

292
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know what he is up to.

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But this time, we can't let him escape.

294
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hello, Director Lu.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Lu Chuning, we are family.

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You stole my goods.

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you not happy?

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You killed Si Yan and my father.

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You want me to be a good wife and have a son.

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You want to talk about morality with me.

301
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Are you worthy?

302
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You are a woman.

303
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Lu Chuning, why do you have to take care of the Lu family?

304
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Lu's will be mine sooner or later.

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You want Lu's so much.

306
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Then I will burn it for you.

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Boss Lu is so great.

308
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Put the gun down now.

309
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Si Yan, is that you?

310
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Si Yan.

311
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Are you crazy? I am Chuning.

312
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Who are you?

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You are so good at playing tricks.

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But it doesn't matter.

315
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I will remember it for you.

316
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The game has just started.

317
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The road is dark because of you

318
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The road is dark because of you

319
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You cross the dark bridge

320
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I am lost and I can't get close to you

321
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I look at the sand in the early morning

322
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The flowers are near the star

323
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I have dreamed of us meeting for many times

324
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But I can't get close to you

325
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to leave the pain to myself

326
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I am not concerned about you

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
If the sea can cut your back

328
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The sky is not a fake

329
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Give me the cloud

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Have you ever had a piece of the sky

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If love is like a dream

332
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
In the dream, we become each other

333
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I am willing to be in your arms

334
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I am willing to be in your arms

335
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The sea is dark because of you

336
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The road is dark because of you

337
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You cross the dark bridge

338
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I am lost and I can't get close to you

339
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I look at the sand in the early morning

340
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The flowers are near the star

341
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I have dreamed of us meeting for many times

342
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But I can't get close to you

343
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I have to leave the pain to myself

344
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I am not concerned about you

345
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If the sea can cut your back

346
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The sky is not a fake

347
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Give me the cloud

348
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Have you ever had a piece of the sky

349
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If love is like a dream

350
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
In the dream, we become each other

351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I am willing to be in your arms

352
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I am willing to be in your arms

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I am willing to be in your arms

354
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I am willing to be in your arms

355
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If love is like a rain in the evening

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The sky can't stop

357
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The wind will scatter my traces

358
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Thank you for watching!
