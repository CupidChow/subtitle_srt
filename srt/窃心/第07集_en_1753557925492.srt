1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
is different.

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,520
You hid it under

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,000
the rank of the Lu family.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,640
It's strange.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,680
Young Master,

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
I've asked around.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,320
Only this shopkeeper

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,800
has seen the same kind of safe button.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,720
Please.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,120
Shopkeeper,

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,040
take a closer look.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
Is this the pendant we saw before?

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,720
Welcome to present ourselves.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,240
There was a lady

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960
carrying an almost the same pendant

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,480
to store some coins.

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,720
She left without solutions.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,440
Let me see again.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,320
Is it her?

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
Yes, that's the girl.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
Please check if she's the one.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Did she use a pendant like this?

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,320
Yes.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,280
Thank you, boss.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,600
Please.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,280
Why is the girl so pretty today?

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
She's in Jingyang today.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,280
I know.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,160
You're here.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
Xiaorou is still alive.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
But I don't dare to act rashly now.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,360
It's not easy for us to

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,600
get into the Rose Scent now.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
We need to make a long-term plan.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
I must

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,160
save Xiaorou.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
I can give her

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,880
as much as she wants.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,320
After all,

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,080
Xiaorou is my biological sister.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
When did you know that?

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
It's too late for me to know.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
Why did you lie to me?

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Do you know

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
how painful it is for me

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
to know about my sister's relationship?

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
Every second is a thorn in my side.

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Why didn't you tell me?

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,440
Why?

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,120
Lu Si Yan,

51
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,040
in fact,

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
whether it's me or Xiaorou,

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,320
it's not a bad thing

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,640
for you to have a sister.

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,320
But have you ever thought

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,640
that you and Lu Yi Jing are brothers?

57
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,320
Lu Yi Jing is getting along with you

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,200
very well.

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,640
Lin Zhong Ning,

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
do you know what I'm talking about?

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,960
Of course I know.

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,480
But I have to save Xiaorou now.

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
After I save Xiaorou,

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,880
I will return her identity.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,120
I will never appear in front of you again.

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm your sister.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
I know how to save her.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
You're really angry.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,480
Beat him.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Master, I'm sorry.

71
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Lu Si Yan is a man of his word.

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
He said he would save Xiaorou.

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
He will definitely save her.

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,680
I'll go to Master Lu and Madam Lu

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
to make it clear.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Take him out.

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,640
I hate it when people lie to me.

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,640
It seems that it's not the time yet.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Stop.

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,080
Where are you going?

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
You don't know how to deal with the goods.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Where are you going to have fun?

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,440
You're always busy with your business.

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,880
You don't even know

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,920
how to exchange food and shelter

86
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
under your eyes.

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,320
Exchange food and shelter?

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Who is it?

89
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,440
Father,

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,360
I made an appointment with the tea house this afternoon

91
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,400
to watch the tea.

92
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm worried that I can't help the tea house.

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,920
I want to find Si Yan to go with me.

94
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Go with your sister now.

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Okay, sister.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
Let's go, brother.

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Break your neck.

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,920
Si Yan is the best student of our school.

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
She may forget some old學生 grandes if she fails some tasks.

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Third Miss Lin, wait for now.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,280
Okay.

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,960
If you have the ability, you can keep on doing this.

103
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Miss Lin, someone is looking for you.

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Miss Lin, who are you waiting for?

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
You know but ask.

106
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,760
I'm waiting for you.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm waiting for you.

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
I'll come out with you.

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
We'll go back together.

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Or I'll show up at my parents' place.

111
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't care.

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
You come with me.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Then practice with me.

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,600
Okay.

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,720
You see how good your father is.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Lu Siye, I'm talking to you.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay.

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,320
If you don't talk to me,

119
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I'll go and tell them.

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
Threaten me?

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,920
Am I a threat?

122
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Okay.

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
Then tell my father

124
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm studying aviation.

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
My father won't do anything to me.

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
But you,

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
if my father knows

128
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,920
you pretend to be his daughter,

129
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
guess what he'll do to you.

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Instead of threatening me here,

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,880
you'd better think about how to please me.

132
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,000
What a coincidence.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,120
I think so too.

134
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,280
Time is the best.

135
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Then

136
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
call me brother first.

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Brother?

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,680
Good.

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Wait for me outside.

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,480
I need to change.

141
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,360
Do you need me to help you?

142
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,840
No.

143
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm thirsty.

144
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,440
Help me get some water.

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Okay.

146
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Your water.

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
Help me get a towel.

148
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,840
Go.

149
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Please.

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,880
I...

151
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,840
You're quite a good boy.

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,240
Wipe your sweat.

153
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Wipe it.

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,800
Are you upset?

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
Isn't it obvious?

156
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Is this your attitude to your brother?

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
My shoulder is a little sore.

158
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,400
Help me rub it.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Go away.

160
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,400
Get out.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
Instead of being tired here for half a year,

162
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,520
I'd rather be beaten to death by your father.

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,080
You said so?

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,080
Okay.

165
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,240
My sister isゼ

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
my embroidered pattern.

167
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,640
And I'm the owner of this shop.

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,040
I'm not sure

169
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
if I have done anything wrong.

170
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,900
You're such a fan of me.

171
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,880
Yes?

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
In the past,

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
you also

174
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,080
transcended time wherever you go.

175
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,040
Let's aggravate detailed thoughts

176
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
and make yourself fit for the workshop.

177
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,880
Fantastically.

178
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
You're so playful.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,680
Learn from him.

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Don't come over.

181
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,720
Don't come over.

182
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,200
Don't come over.

183
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
What's wrong with you, Chu Ni?

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Don't touch me.

185
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong with you?

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,760
Are you okay?

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,120
Don't come over.

188
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Okay.

190
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
I won't go over.

191
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,880
Wait for me.

192
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,200
Thank you.

193
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm glad that you're not my sister.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,160
Because you're not my sister.

195
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,000
I love you.

196
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,520
What are you doing?

197
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,560
How should I see through this bull?

198
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,160
Love and hate in the world

199
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
are mixed with sadness and sorrow.

200
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,640
How much tears are left

201
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,120
for a young man?

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,240
I want to be with you in this life.

203
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
The heaven is teasing.

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,960
Do you have any worries in your eyes?

205
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Even if it's a hole in the wall.

206
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,480
I can't read it in my dream.

207
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,720
I can't understand it after waking up.

208
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,800
It's worth it.

209
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
You are the moon and the autumn.

210
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
The wind blows in the earth.

211
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,040
There is a pair of clear eyes.

212
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
You are the red beans on the side.

213
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,600
The small and small dreams.

214
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Let me walk hand in hand.

215
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,480
The horse is concerned about the heart.

216
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,760
Rou is still suffering.

217
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,200
How can I think of her happiness

218
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
and her brother's love?

219
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,120
It's right to stand still in the street.

220
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,760
When I return the identity to Rou,

221
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,960
I can also be her assistant in the Lu family.

222
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,560
Deputy Chief.

223
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,840
I want to ask you some English.

224
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
The land is built on the land of the department store.

225
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,480
You have to communicate in English.

226
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
I almost lost a big gall to not understand English.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
So you don't have any English foundation?

228
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,600
I know some basics.

229
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,000
For example?

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,120
Hello.

231
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
Welcome.

232
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Money.

233
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
Fast.

234
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
Yes, please.

235
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,400
Birthday.

236
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,480
Birthday.

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,760
Birthday.

238
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
Birthday.

239
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
Birthday.

240
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
Is not standard?

241
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,440
CHAO, it's time for me to take you out

242
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,380
first.

243
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,140
Ok

244
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:12,880
You lost a friend in the former

245
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,640
Why your face as withライト

246
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,800
So

247
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,800
Can you take a rest

248
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm afraid to be alone

249
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm afraid to be alone

250
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm afraid to be alone

251
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm afraid to be alone

252
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Who can forget my pain

253
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
You are the one who is beautiful

254
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I want to be your shadow

255
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
The sea of ​​blue sea, the sea of ​​dark sea

256
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You are warm tonight

257
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Stop it

258
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Where is the light

259
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm not awake yet

260
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
The love that will fly away

261
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Your soft arms are no longer

262
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,800
A moment, you are with him

263
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Missing, missed

264
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I miss you

265
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I miss you

266
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I miss you

267
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Sister

268
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Good evening, sister

269
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Siyan

270
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Siyan

271
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Happy birthday to you

272
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Happy birthday to you

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Happy birthday to you

274
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Happy birthday to you

275
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Happy birthday to you

276
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Correct pronunciation

277
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
But today is not my birthday

278
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I know

279
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Today can be ours

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Today can also be your birthday

281
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Happy birthday

282
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Make a wish

283
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Hope

284
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't talk

285
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Don't talk

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Don't talk

287
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Try it

288
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Is it delicious

289
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I really didn't expect the cake to be so sweet

290
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
This is my first time eating cake

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Then the cake is sweet or am I sweet

292
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
The cake is exactly the advantage

293
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
But you

294
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
A little greasy

295
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Don't move

296
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm not going to eat

297
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm not going to eat

298
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800

I'm not going to eat

308
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm not going to eat

309
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm not going to eat

310
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm not going to eat

311
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm not going to eat

312
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm not going to eat

313
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm not going to eat

314
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm not going to eat

315
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I'm not going to eat

316
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800

317
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800

319
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm not going to eat

320
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm not going to eat

321
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm not going to eat

322
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm not going to eat

323
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Only care

324
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Do you still want to see me

325
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm looking you

326
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,800
You're so organisable

327
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Then I'll go

328
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
wait

329
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
What's wrong?

330
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
It's a gift for you.

331
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Is it pretty?

332
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Is it okay?

333
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
It's okay.

334
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Thanks.

335
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Your Highness.
