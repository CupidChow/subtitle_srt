1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,620
rip

2
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,240
The End

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
What's the matter?

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Did you find out about what happened back then?

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,240
You were the one who introduced me to the jade pendant.

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Is there anything else that can prove her identity?

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
There is.

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
I remember there was a birthmark on her shoulder.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
A plum birthmark.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Who?

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
You two are the same person.

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Is this the birthmark you're talking about?

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
That's right.

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
It's the same plum birthmark.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Why is the jade pendant with Chu Ning?

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
You mean my safety pin?

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
I gave it to Chu Ning.

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Chu Ning didn't tell me about this.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Did you two recognize each other because of that safety pin?

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
You're my daughter.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Mother.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Congratulations, Madam.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
This girl seems to be a beautiful woman.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
She shouldn't be so crazy.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
I shouldn't be so crazy.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I should just let her go for now.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
I should just drive away Lin Chu Ning.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Kneel.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
I told you to kneel.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Why should I kneel?

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
You pretended to be my daughter and you still said you didn't do anything wrong.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Chu Ning, I've already recognized my parents.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Silly girl.

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
You shouldn't be sorry for her.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
She should be sorry for you.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
You're too kind.

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Lin Chu Ning.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I really thought you were my daughter.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
I tried my best to make up for you.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I wanted to give you the star nest.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,240
How could you bear to hurt a mother who lost her daughter for many years and lives in regret all day?

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Regret?

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
The day you pushed me into the river,

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
the day you said you wanted to kill your own daughter,

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I didn't see any regret.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Xiaorou, aren't you afraid?

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
The next person she wants to kill is you.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Mother.

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,240
I knew you weren't my daughter and pushed you into the lake.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,240
How could I bear to hurt my own daughter?

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Come on.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Get out of here and get out of the city hall.

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Lu Si Yan.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Get out.

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
You want to rebel?

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Si Yan.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
She's not your sister.

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Be more modest.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
I don't want her to be my sister.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Mother.

63
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Did you forget?

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,240
I told you to protect her for me.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't let anyone hurt her.

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I won't tell you what you did.

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
It doesn't mean I don't know.

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
If that's the case,

70
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
I'll tell you.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
You're mine.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Kill me first if you want to kill her.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
I won't allow you to touch her.

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Si Yan.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Between this woman and her parents,

76
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
do you want to choose her?

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't want to choose her.

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
You forced me to choose her.

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
In my life,

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
I don't care what I do or who I'm with.

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
It's my choice.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't care.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
How dare you!

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Okay.

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Very good.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
You killed Lin Chu Ni because of you.

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
How dare you do this to our family?

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
That's right.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I admit.

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
I did wrong to Xiaorou.

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
But to your family,

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
I didn't do anything wrong to you.

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
These days,

94
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
only because of me,

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Lu's department store can be successful.

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Master Lu.

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
If you want to kill me,

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
you'll be told off.

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Please think twice before you act.

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Okay.

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Dad, mom.

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Chu Ning has been suffering since she was a child.

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,240
She only cares about her family's warmth.

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Please let her go.

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Can I let you go?

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
But it's not easy for you to leave the Lu family.

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I let you go.

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
But whether you can get out alive

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
depends on your own fate.

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Please, Master Lu.

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I have a message.

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,240
I want to leave the Lu family.

113
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
In my dream,

114
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
I'd rather you get kicked out like a dog.

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
You have to be dead.

116
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
You're so cruel.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
You should pay for your mistakes.

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Lu Si Yan.

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I've been generous.

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
But if I don't be a good son,

121
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
everyone can bully me.

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Let's go.

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I can do it.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Let's make it a clear end.

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Let's go together.

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Si Yan.

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
No.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Si Yan.

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Si Yan.

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Si Yan.

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Master.

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Please forgive them.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Let me down.

134
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Master.

135
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Master.

136
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Master.

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
I beg you.

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Get down.

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Master.

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I beg you.

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Master.

142
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I'm so confused.

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm so lost.

144
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I can't forget you.

145
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Time has passed.

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
The past is long gone.

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Where is the bitter night?

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Who is so far away?

149
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Looking back,

150
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I can only see the smile.

151
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
The smoke and the frost.

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Time flies.

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm still here.

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,240
The broken memories are still in my heart.

155
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Who is so far away?

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Hugging me,

157
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
like the time we were in the dream.

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
The past has passed.

159
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
The past is long gone.

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Where is the bitter night?

161
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Who is so far away?

162
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Looking back,

163
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
I can only see the smile.

164
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Si Yan.

165
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
If you dare to step out of this gate,

166
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
you will never come back.

167
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Who is so far away?

168
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Hugging me,

169
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
like the time we were in the dream.

170
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Si Yan.

171
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Si Yan.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
It's not bad to walk to the end with you.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
I was afraid you would abandon me.

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
My parents are so cruel to you.

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Your parents are your parents.

176
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
You are you.

177
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I almost gave up your family

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,240
to save your family.

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I, Lin Chu Ning, never do any loss-making business.

180
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
You are mine.

181
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Okay, Miss Lin.

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I won't change it.

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Here you are.

184
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
The principal gave me the jade and the cherry.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
It's good that I didn't have to

186
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
hire any sisters for Xiaorou.

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I can finally go back to the Yuying Hall

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
and fulfill my duty to them.

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
But you don't have a home.

190
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Who said I don't have a home?

191
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I'll take you to a place.

192
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Where are you taking me?

193
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Okay, turn around.

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Can I open my eyes now?

195
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Open them.

196
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
What are you doing?

197
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I can't hold the fire.

198
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Actually, I've been prepared.

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I know we'll leave the Lu family sooner or later.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
So I bought this place.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
This is our home from now on.

202
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
You are not only my son

203
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
but also my family.

204
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Don't be too moved.

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Here.

206
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
One is the deed.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
The other is the transfer.

208
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
From now on,

209
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
the whole Yuying Hall is yours.

210
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
From now on,

211
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,240
you can live here with the Yuying Hall sisters.

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Si Yan.

213
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Thank you.

214
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Do you love me?

215
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Yes.

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Be careful.

217
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't chase me.

218
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Let's play this.

219
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Wait for me.

220
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Be careful.

221
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Let's play the one in front of the window.

222
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Let me play.

223
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Do you like this?

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Are you happy?

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Why are you so thin today?

226
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
It's a pity that you are not good at studying.

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
You should wear some clothes tomorrow.

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm not big enough.

229
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Yes.

230
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Come on.

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Look at this.

232
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Do you want to play this?

233
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Give it to me.

234
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay.

235
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
You've been playing for a long time.

236
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
You are really a soul-seeker.

237
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Mo Chen.

238
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
What do you mean?

239
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
This is a betrothal gift.

240
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I've said that

241
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I will marry you in a grand way.

242
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm not the daughter of the Lu family.

243
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
You should marry Lu Yujin or Xiaorou.

244
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
But I hope you

245
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
don't be controlled by others

246
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
and can pursue your love freely.

247
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm pursuing my love.

248
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Chuning.

249
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
You are the same as me.

250
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
You are the only child of my parents.

251
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I was born with you.

252
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Don't you think it's a match?

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
It's interesting.

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Chuning.

255
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Master Lu is a righteous man.

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
He will never betray you.

257
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
But Mrs. Lu

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
won't let you go so easily.

259
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
And Boss Gao.

260
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Boss Gao.

261
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I was so angry with you

262
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
because of Wen Rousheng.

263
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
When the storm is over,

264
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
it will come again.

265
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Only I can protect you.

266
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Are you threatening me?

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Of course not.

268
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm not like some people

269
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
who only speak nicely.

270
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I will use actions to prove

271
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
that only I can protect you.

272
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay.

273
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Then I will ask Director Shen

274
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
to prove himself.

275
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
What are you doing?

276
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Deputy Chief.

277
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Don't move.

278
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Did you prove it?

279
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Deputy Chief.

280
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
There are two birds in the sky.

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
The big bird is also a loyal bird.

282
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
There are only two birds in the sky.

283
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I have found

284
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
my true love.

285
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Mo Chenge.

286
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I believe you can find

287
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
your pen and paper.

288
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I will go back to the garden.

289
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Move.

290
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Deputy Chief.

291
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Open your arms.

292
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Let me measure your size.

293
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Are you jealous?

294
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
No.

295
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You are so old.

296
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
You still say you are not jealous.

297
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Hurry up.

298
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I have proposed to you.

299
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Am I not jealous?

300
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
You did it on purpose.

301
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Isn't it obvious?

302
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Sign it.

303
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Are you satisfied?

304
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Then raise your arms.

305
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
What are you doing?

306
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
I won't tell you.

307
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Okay.

308
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Turn around.

309
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Turn around.

310
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I know you will make me clothes.

311
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I know it.

312
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
I am waiting for you.

313
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Chu Niang.

314
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Deputy Chief.

315
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Is it beautiful?

316
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Of course it is.

317
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
What does it mean?

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
The bone of the soul.

319
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Give me your hand.

320
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Do you feel my heartbeat?

321
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Your heart beats fast.

322
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Because you are in my heart.

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Deputy Chief.

324
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Let's continue training.

325
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Take it.

326
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I have been dreaming since I was a child.

327
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I can fly like a bird.

328
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
In the sky,

329
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
I can fly freely.

330
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
At that time, I didn't know what a pilot was.

331
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
When I learned that Junxiao recruited pilots,

332
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I signed up for it at the first time.

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
At first, it was just for fun.

334
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
But when I saw the enemy's plane

335
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
flying in our air-control,

336
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
I made up my mind.

337
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
To protect this leader.

338
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
One day,

339
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
we will return the country to its original state.

340
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,960
There will be no more

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Trust me.

342
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I will protect you and everyone.

343
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I believe you.

344
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
It's hot.

345
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
I am leaving.

346
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Who is the one who is crying?

347
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Who knows that I am a fool?

348
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I am not willing to part with you.

349
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
So I can't leave.

350
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I am not willing to leave.

351
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
So I can't leave.

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Turn around.

353
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Turn around.

354
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Turn around.

355
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Turn around.

356
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
What's the matter?

357
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Mrs. Luo, you are here without my invitation.

358
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
What's the matter?

359
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
I respect you as Si Yan's mother.

360
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
That's why I have been tolerant of you all the time.

361
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
But I don't mean to be bullied.

362
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I have never thought that you are a bully.

363
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
You pretend to be my daughter.

364
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
That's enough.

365
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I am not your daughter.

366
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
I am your mother.

367
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
I will not be bullied.

368
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I am your mother.

369
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
I am your mother.

370
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I am your mother.

371
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I am your mother.

372
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I am your mother.

373
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
You pretend to be my daughter.

374
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
You seduce my son.

375
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
You don't even know your identity.

376
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
You are a bastard.

377
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
You are not even good at talking.

378
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
You even dream of becoming a rich man.

379
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
You are so obsessed with my son.

380
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
You don't even know your family.

381
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Mrs. Lu, please be careful.

382
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Don't let your son be obsessed with me.

383
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
I am a bastard.

384
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I am so obsessed with him.

385
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
In the end, you will only blame others' daughter.

386
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,240
You are still so stubborn.

387
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
You are really a bastard.

388
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
I can't let you live.

389
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Since Master said he would spare your life,

390
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I won't kill you.

391
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
But you must leave.

392
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I will hate you whether I die or escape.

393
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Let him hate you.

394
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I am his mother.

395
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
He can't love you forever.

396
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
He won't hate me forever.

397
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
No need.

398
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
My wife can't walk.

399
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
She takes medicine and coughs.

400
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
I am back.

401
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Why are you here?

402
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Where is Chuning?

403
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Deputy Chief.

404
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I asked you where is Lin Chuning.

405
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
You like your sister.

406
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I am your sister too.

407
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
How did you do to her?

408
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I didn't do anything to her.

409
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Your mother wants to kill her.

410
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
You won't see her again.

411
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
The train is leaving.

412
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Your love will only kill her.

413
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Don't worry.

414
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
It will be fine.

415
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
You know what?

416
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Chuning.

417
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Remember to bring me the medicine.

418
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Chuning.

419
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
It's me.

420
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Jiahua.

421
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Chuning.

422
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
I am here.

423
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Wang Chunge.

424
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Why are you here?

425
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Xiaorou said you were sent away.

426
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
So I came.

427
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Are you okay?

428
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I am fine.

429
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Thank god you came in time.

430
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I found a safe place.

431
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I won't let them hurt you again.

432
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Okay?

433
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Wang Chunge.

434
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,240
I thought I made it clear last time.

435
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
But Lu Siyan can't protect you.

436
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Mrs. Lu won't give up.

437
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Even if you escaped to other cities.

438
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
You are a weak woman.

439
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Without me and Lu Siyan.

440
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
How can you be safe?

441
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Why do I have to depend on you?

442
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
To be able to stand on my own two feet?

443
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Chuning.

444
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Chuning.

445
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Lu Siyan.

446
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240

447
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
