COLORING

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Episode 15

4
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Mom!

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Mom?

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
You're just a lowly concubine, but you call me mom?

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I remember there was a birthmark on her shoulder.

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
A plum birthmark.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Go on.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Stop!

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Mom, what are you doing?

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Are you using your private life?

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Deputy Chief, save my sister!

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Sister?

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Did you hurt her when I drove the car?

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
You bitch!

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Deputy Chief, she's not...

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Mom!

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I saw her in the hospital.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Do I need to tell you?

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
It's done.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Good girl, thank you.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Mom, what are you talking about?

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
What's this?

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
It's bad for your health.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
I'll make up for it when I get back.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Of course.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Take it.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Nurse, take it.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Okay.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
What?

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Deputy Chief, go back to your room and rest.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Mom, is there anything I can't hear?

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Nothing.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
It's my private life with her.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Go back to your room and rest.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Okay.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
You guys talk.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Go back to your room and rest.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Yes.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I was wondering why she wouldn't confess her love.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
It's a secret.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Madam, you're trying to cover up your position

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
by hiding the truth from everyone.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm not your mother.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Yihua Jing?

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm not your daughter.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
But Lu Si Yan is not your son.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
You're in the hospital to exchange blood.

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
You're afraid that Lu Si Yan's identity will be exposed.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Si Yan is my son.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I raised him for 20 years.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
He is my son.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You protect your son so much.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Then you have to be nice to me.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll be your daughter in the future.

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
If someone finds out about my identity,

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Lu Si Yan's identity will be exposed.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The dead people are very strict.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Then you can try.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I've written a letter in advance to Dean Lin.

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
As long as I die,

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Dean Lin will give the letter to the newspaper.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
In less than two hours,

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
everyone in the city will know this news.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
So,

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
act like a little.

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
It's best to let everyone know that

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
you and I are mother and daughter.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Otherwise, no one can live well.

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Chunni.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Is it beautiful?

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
This is a rose I planted myself.

74
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
For you.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Do you feel better when you see this?

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Of course.

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Let's make up.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
What's wrong?

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Miss Lin.

80
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
This is what Miss Rou asked me to give you.

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Chunni, come to the west corner warehouse.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Let's make a decision.

83
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Otherwise, you will never see your little sister again.

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
What did she say?

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Nothing.

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Rou, help me recover soon.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Okay.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
You finally came.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
You alone?

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Where are the kids?

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
They...

92
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I gave them all to Boss Gao.

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
This slap is for them.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
This slap is for me.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Is it enough?

96
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
It's my turn.

97
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Have you seen enough?

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Don't come over.

99
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
You really think I'm so stupid?

100
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Do you think I will come alone to recover?

101
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Do you think I will believe you?

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
He asked me to go to the west corner warehouse to find him.

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I'll go.

104
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
No.

105
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
How about this?

106
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
You wait for me at the door.

107
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
If I don't come out in ten minutes,

108
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
you go in and save me.

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I'll give you five minutes.

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Okay.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Of course I know you're not that stupid.

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
So I'm also hiding out there.

113
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Chunni,

114
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
why did we become like this?

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I don't want to be like this.

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
I was beaten by thousands of people.

117
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Why are you so proud?

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I want you to be like me.

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
So we can still be good sisters.

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Don't fight.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't resist.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Hurry up.

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Come here.

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Get out of here.

125
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
If you come here again, I'll kill him.

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Kill me.

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'll kill you even if I have to die with you.

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't worry. I'll go now.

129
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Go.

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't come here.

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Go.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Let me go.

133
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Come on.

134
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Let me go.

135
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Let me go.

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Come on.

137
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Stop.

138
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Stop.

139
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Siyan.

140
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Siyan.

141
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Siyan.

142
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm your sister.

143
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
You should be glad that you're my sister.

144
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Or I'll kill you now.

145
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
I've already asked Si to save them.

146
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Does it hurt?

147
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
It's okay.

148
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I didn't expect that she would do such a thing.

149
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
If she weren't my sister, I would have killed her.

150
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Enough.

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
You didn't say anything.

152
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I didn't say anything.

153
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I didn't say anything.

154
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Okay.

155
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
You weren't hurt, right?

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Of course not.

157
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
They can't defeat me.

158
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Siyan is so powerful.

159
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I have to do something, too.

160
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I want Lu to accept me as soon as possible.

161
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll work hard for our future.

162
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I don't care what you do.

163
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I just hope you won't get hurt again.

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I'll protect you in the future.

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
How could I get hurt when you're here?

166
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I'll marry you.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll wait for you.

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I said I wouldn't let you be together.

169
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I just won't.

170
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Mom.

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
We're not discussing it with you.

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
We're just informing you.

173
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
We're already together.

174
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Siyan.

175
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Are you forcing me to die?

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm not forcing you.

177
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Whether it's my career or choosing who to be with,

178
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
you have no right to be too stable.

179
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
This time is different.

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
You have your own reasons.

181
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Mrs. Lu.

182
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I've never been in love with you.

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I've never thought of taking Siyan away.

184
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You don't have to be so hostile to me.

185
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Siyan and I will be together.

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
We'll love her like you do.

187
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
No.

188
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
You can't love her.

189
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Why?

190
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Because...

191
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Because you're blood brothers.

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Mrs. Lu.

193
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
You'd rather admit I'm your daughter than let me...

194
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Chunni.

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
You're really my daughter.

196
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Mom.

197
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Can you stop lying to me just to break us up?

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You've made a mistake before.

199
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Rou is my sister.

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Right.

201
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Rou.

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You can ask Rou.

203
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
You have to admit her

204
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
because she imitated Chunni's birthmark.

205
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Chunni.

206
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Is there a plum birthmark on your shoulder?

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
You can still separate now.

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Don't make another mistake.

209
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Chunni.

210
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Tell me it's not true.

211
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
You made a mistake the last time.

212
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You did this time too.

213
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Right?

214
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
You can't be my sister.

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
The birthmark is fake.

216
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
This birthmark is a fake.

217
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
The birthmark is a fake.

218
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
You can't be my sister.

219
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
You're my sister.

220
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
You're my sister.

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
You're my sister.

222
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
You're my sister.

223
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
You're my sister.

224
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
This birthmark is fake, right?

225
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
This birthmark is fake, right?

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Tell me.

227
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
You're not my sister.

228
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
You're not my sister.

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Right?

230
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Tell me you're not my sister.

231
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
You're not my sister.

232
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
You can't be my sister.

233
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
You're not my sister.

234
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Tell me.

235
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Zi Yan.

236
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Tell me you're not my sister.

237
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Tell me you're not my sister.

238
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Tell me.

239
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Tell me.

240
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I didn't believe you from the beginning.

241
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
But now I do.

242
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I've always said I'm your sister.

243
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Now I'm really your sister.

244
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I believe this is retribution.

245
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Retribution?

246
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,400
If this is retribution,

247
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I have the most to say.

248
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I believe this is retribution.

249
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You're not my sister.

250
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Chong Nian.

251
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Zi Yan.

252
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Chong Nian.

253
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Do you know?

254
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I really thought...

255
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I really thought we could be together.

256
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
But why did I leave you?

257
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I don't want to be like this.

258
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I don't want to be like this.

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Zi Yan.

260
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Today,

261
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
let's pretend I'm not your sister.

262
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
We...

263
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Zi Yan.

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
It's not you.

265
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Go away.

266
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Go away.

267
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Zi Yan.

268
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
I love you.

269
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
You don't know how happy I am

270
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
when I know we're not sisters.

271
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Zi Yan.

272
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't care about the Lu family.

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm willing to be a beggar.

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I beg you, Zi Yan.

275
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I beg you.

276
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Be with me, Zi Yan.

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
But you're my sister.

278
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Don't call me sister.

279
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Lin Chun Ning is your sister.

280
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Zi Yan.

281
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
You two are impossible.

282
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Impossible for the rest of your life.

283
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Shut up.

284
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Shut up.

285
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Shut up.

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Zi Yan.

287
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I can do anything for you.

288
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Just be with me.

289
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Zi Yan.

290
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh no.

291
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
The big girl is dead.

292
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
You should have given me Lu Si Yan.

294
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
You knew it.

295
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,400
We're sisters.

296
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Yes.

297
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I want to see you suffer.

298
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
I want to see you be desperate.

299
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
I want to see you two suffer.

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Xiao Rou.

301
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Why did you become like this?

302
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Why do you ask me?

303
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Lin Chun Ning.

304
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
You knew I like Lu Si Yan.

305
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
But you insisted on being with him.

306
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Gao Yun Feng came to humiliate me

307
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
because he couldn't get you.

308
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
When I was in the fragrance of tenderness,

309
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
what were you doing?

310
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
You were trying to be affectionate with Lu Si Yan.

311
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Do you think I should hate you?

312
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I didn't cause your tragedy.

313
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You knew we were both victims.

314
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I was punishing the one who did it.

315
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
But you?

316
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,400
You became a victim for the sake of your family.

317
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
But you put everything on me.

318
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
You even put on a show that everyone owes you.

319
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Xiao Rou.

320
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
No one owes you.

321
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
You owe yourself.

322
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Don't be angry.

323
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Do you realize you're numb?

324
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I know you're a spirit.

325
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
So I added a colorless poison.

326
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
This poison won't kill you.

327
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
But it will make you move.

328
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
If I die,

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
will you be able to be on the dark side?

331
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Of course.

332
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I can replace you if you die.

333
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Your man, your land, your everything is mine.

334
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Everything will start over.

335
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't be so serious.

336
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
The more serious you are, the more numb you are.

337
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,400
They will think you're doing this for your brother.

338
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
For love.

339
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
No one will suspect me.

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,400
If the sea can cut your back,

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I'll be your coat of arms.

343
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Give me the only one.

344
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:56,580
Have you ever had a

345
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,580
I'm willing to be in your arms forever.

346
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I'll create a sea of unknown languages.

347
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I'll travel around the world.

348
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,580
You're like a moonlit, dark and remote land.

349
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,580
I'll only get close to you.

350
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,580
I'll go to the bottom of the sea.

351
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Like a fallen leaf.

352
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,580
I'll go to the bottom of the sea.

353
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,580
I'll go to the bottom of the sea.

354
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I'll give myself a strong old life.

355
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,580
I'm related to you.

356
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,580
If the sea can cut your back,

357
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,580
I'll be your coat of arms.

358
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Give me the only one.

359
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Have you ever had a

360
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,580
If love is like a dream,

361
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'll be your coat of arms.

362
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,580
I'm willing to be in your arms forever.

363
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:28,580
I'm willing to be in your arms forever.

364
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll be your coat of arms.

365
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,580
If love is like a dream,

366
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I'll be your coat of arms.

367
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,580
The wind blows my memories away.
