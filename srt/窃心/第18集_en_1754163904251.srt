1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,760
Embracing the

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Look at the man I love most

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
sleeping together

4
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Do you want to eat?

5
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Lin Chuning

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Do you feel humiliated when you kneel down to me?

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Don't worry

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I will make you feel this humiliation again and again

9
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Siyan

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
You are here

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Eat one

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
No

13
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Eat one?

14
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
I said I don't want to eat

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Okay

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
My feet are so sore

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Help me to massage my feet

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Enough, I will help you

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Chuning

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Shen Bochen

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Chuning

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Are you okay?

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
You know him?

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Of course

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Whether it's at the dock or at the Lu's department store

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
It's all you

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Why do you do this?

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
You like heroine so much

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Siyan

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
This is director Shen

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Also Chuning's fiance

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
Since director Shen is here

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Let's show him a little respect

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Okay

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Please take care of your fiance

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Okay

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Young Mistress

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Please take care of your husband

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Siyan, what's wrong?

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Siyan

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Don't go

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Siyan

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Sister

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Siyan, is that you?

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
It's me

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Don't come over

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Siyan

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Don't come over

49
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Don't come over

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
You are not the Siyan I know

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I am Siyan, sister

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
No matter what I say

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Or what I do

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
It's not my intention

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
I don't want to be like this

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Sister

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Only you can save me

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
You come to save me

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Pull me back

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Okay?

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I want to go home

62
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I want to go home

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I want to go back to you

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Okay?

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Siyan

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Siyan

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Siyan

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Siyan

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Siyan

70
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Siyan

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Chuning

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Chuning

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Chuning

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
You are so weak

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Why do you still think about her?

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
She lost her memory

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
She doesn't want to do this

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Can you stop lying to yourself like this?

79
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
You are not the Chuning I knew before

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
She can love and hate

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
She can take and let go

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
But now

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
For a man

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
You hurt yourself all over the body

85
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Do you really love her so much?

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
You are not in any serious trouble

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Just some bleeding

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
You will be discharged in two days

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Thank you

90
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
By the way

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I was poisoned with red-cured flowers

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Is my body okay?

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Did you do something wrong?

94
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
You did take red-cured flowers

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
But the effect of red-cured flowers is not only to remove the bleeding

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
But also to relieve the stress

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
No

98
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
I am not a man

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
You are here to do something wrong

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I think you are depressed recently

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
You didn't have a good rest

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Maybe it's because of the water

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
You have a stomachache

104
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
You want to kill me

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Why do you save me?

106
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
What should I do?

107
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
If she can't remember

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Miss, come to pick flowers

109
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Will she think about me forever?

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Sir, come to pick flowers

111
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Miss, come to pick flowers

112
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Here

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
I want all these flowers

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Thank you

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I have given up on you for a long time

116
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
But you are still firm

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
This time

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I will protect our love

119
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Sir

120
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
I will not give up on you

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Absolutely not

122
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Miss Lu

123
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
My young master said

124
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
He has a relationship with you

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Only you can live or die

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
You must meet again in the mall

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
I want him to tell me in person

128
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Why?

129
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
I hurt you like this

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
You still want to find me

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
My young master

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Is it true that Lu said

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
He was just playing with firewood?

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Chuning

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You are so stupid

136
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Let's go

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I won't leave

138
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
I want him to tell me in person

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Si Yan

140
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
You are really anxious

141
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You are so good at it

142
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Chen Fucheng

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Did you see it?

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
This is your woman

145
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
As long as I hook my finger

146
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
It will stick

147
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Does it hurt?

148
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I successfully attracted your attention

149
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Lu Si Yan

150
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Even if you lose your memory

151
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
People's nature will not change

152
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
You still eat this after playing

153
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
You are so stubborn

154
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes

155
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
I am stubborn

156
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
And I will be stubborn until the end

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
If it wasn't for Si Yan's good

158
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Do you think I care about you now?

159
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
I tell you

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I will let you recover your memory

161
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Let the old Lu Si Yan come back

162
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
He can't come back

163
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
He has completely disappeared

164
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
He will never come back

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Ok

166
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Let's make a bet

167
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Ok

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
You are sure

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Don't worry

170
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I can't lose

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Lu Si Yan won't let me lose

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
He will come back

173
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Ok

174
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's wait and see

175
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Chuning

176
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
You still love her, right?

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Even if I have done so much for you

178
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
You still have her in your heart

179
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Mo Chenge

180
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I am sorry

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Chuning

182
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I think for you

183
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I am the one who is calling you

184
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You want to kill Lu Si Yan

185
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I will help you out

186
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
You want Lu Si Yan to give up

187
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I will accompany you to act

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
You are my fiance

189
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
But now in front of me

190
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
You are so obsessed with another man

191
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

192
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Even if

193
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
There is only a little bit

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
From now on

195
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I will not be in danger of the world

196
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I want to do something that makes me happy

197
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Even if I have to do something

198
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I have to get what I want

199
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Si Yan

200
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Si Yan

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Si Yan, what's wrong with you?

202
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I am fine

203
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
You should rest first

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Si Yan, what's wrong with you?

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Why?

206
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Why do I always think of some

207
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
The story of Lu Chunming's love

208
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Why?

209
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Si Yan

210
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Isn't the person I love you?

211
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Si Yan

212
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
You did spend some time with him

213
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
But you found out that he lied to you

214
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
That's why he is so obsessed with you

215
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't worry

216
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
The person you love is always me

217
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Really?

218
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Yes

219
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
If he went to see Lin Chunning

220
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Then kill him

221
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Yes

222
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Are you hungry?

223
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Don't be shy

224
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
You guys eat

225
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I will put some cakes here every day

226
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
You can come and get it every day

227
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Thank you, Mr. Lu

228
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Thank you

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
You are welcome

230
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Thank you

231
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
It's you

232
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
It's me

233
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

234
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
You won't

235
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Why?

236
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
You looked like him just now

237
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
It seems that your wife is not worried about you

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
And she is watching you

239
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
They seem to come to kill you

240
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
That way

241
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Chase

242
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Where is this?

243
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Brother Yi, you are so stupid

244
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
You are so stupid

245
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
A place you are familiar with

246
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
The person they want to kill is you

247
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Why should I run with you?

248
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Because you won't die

249
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Have you ever thought that

250
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Once you see me, Lu will kill me

251
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
You never doubted anything?

252
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Don't try to make a scene

253
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
It's you

254
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You are the one who set us up

255
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
You are the one who made us fall into this situation

256
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
So he wants to kill you

257
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
It's all your fault

258
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Why did you follow me just now?

259
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
You can't bear it

260
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Isn't it?

261
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Even if they say that I am a bad person

262
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
They want you to hate me

263
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
But you still can't bear it

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
It's true that Lu wants to kill me

265
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
It's also true that you can't bear it

266
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
You are not afraid of me

267
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
You are afraid of me

268
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
You are afraid of me

269
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
You are afraid of me

270
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Memory can be cut off

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
But the heart won't

272
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Here

273
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
It's you

274
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Why is my body so close to her?

275
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
It's Xiaorou who is coming

276
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Those two killers have been solved

277
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Then I won't bother you

278
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I have married

279
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
That's fake

280
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,760
You will marry Lin Chuning alone in this life, next life and the next life

281
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Xiaorou has lost her child

282
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I can't live with her

283
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
That's not your child

284
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Why do you have to believe what she said?

285
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Enough, shut up

286
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I won't allow you to slander my wife again

287
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Don't talk nonsense anymore, okay?

288
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
You said that

289
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
As long as you love each other, you can talk nonsense

290
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I know you are very sad now

291
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I don't know who to believe

292
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
But give me some time

293
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Please tell me the story between us

294
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Aren't we enemies?

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
They are family

296
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
How can we be enemies?

297
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
We will be good friends sooner or later

298
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
This is where we often come

299
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Do you remember?

300
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I will find the truth by myself

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Before this

302
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
You and I are enemies

303
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
It doesn't matter, I will wait for you

304
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Don't go

305
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't go

306
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
It's a flower

307
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
How do you know?

308
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I once escaped with refugees

309
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
And refugees saved a flower

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
It's this portrait

311
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
How can there be a flower here?

312
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
You should tell the police

313
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
If the news spreads, the consequences will be unimaginable

314
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
But

315
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
I have a good idea

316
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
I can test your good wife

317
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Si Yan, what's wrong?

318
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Nothing

319
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I just feel dizzy

320
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Are you ok?

321
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Si Yan

322
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
You have a flower

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Wait

324
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I will call the doctor

325
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
He will take care of me

326
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Let's wait for him

327
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
See if your good wife will come back

328
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Director

329
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
The flower body has been burned

330
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
And we posted an announcement

331
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
To warn the people in the city

332
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
If anyone finds the flower

333
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
We need to report it to them

334
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
This is the sachet you asked me to buy

335
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,760
This sachet is the same as the one on the body of the flower, right?

336
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Yes

337
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
But why do you want me to buy this?

338
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I need it, you can go

339
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes

340
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Shen Mochen

341
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Someone is sending you the pillow

342
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
What did you say?

343
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
What's up?

344
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Lu Si Yan, your flower

345
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
You are so lucky

346
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I have a good idea

347
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Lu Si Yan, your flower

348
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
When you found the flower body

349
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
If Lu Si Yan was really infected

350
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
He would not be so calm

351
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm afraid they set a trap

352
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Want to try

353
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
You said the couple is the same bird

354
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
But they are different

355
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
It seems that you

356
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Have no feelings for Lu Si Yan

357
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Instead of talking nonsense

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
You should think about what to do

359
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Lin Chu Ning

360
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Lu Si Yan has lost his memory

361
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
And he is so obsessed with him

362
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
If this continues

363
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
We will both go out

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
How long have you been out?

365
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Two hours

366
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
He must be suspicious

367
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Because he has been out for too long

368
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Take this back

369
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
I will tell him that you went to the temple to pray for him

370
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Si Yan

371
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Si Yan

372
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Si Yan

373
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I asked the doctors in the city

374
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
They said they were not willing to ask for a doctor

375
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I caught some medicines for you

376
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
And this

377
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
This is the sachet I asked for you

378
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
You wear it

379
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
It can keep you safe

380
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Thank you

381
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Si Yan

382
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Are you okay?

383
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Isn't it fake?

384
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
How can it be fake?

385
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Si Yan

386
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I will go and get the medicine for you

387
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Wait for me

388
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Wait

389
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Xiaorou

390
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
You saw it all

391
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Your wife doesn't love you much

392
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
She is hiding from you

393
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Enough

394
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
She just went to get the medicine

395
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
How about this?

396
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Give me the sachet

397
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760

I will try it for you

404
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I will try it for you

405
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I will try it for you

406
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I will try it for you

407
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
I will try it for you

408
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I will try it for you

409
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760

429
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760

430
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760

435
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I will try it for you

436
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
I will try it for you

437
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I will try it for you

438
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I will try it for you

439
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,760
I will try it for you

440
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I will try it for you

441
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I will try it for you

442
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860

I will try it for you

447
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
I will check the mare

448
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,260
I will take you out

449
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Don't waste it

450
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I will yell it

451
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Don't waste it

452
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,260
遇到海水褪卻到底 像一片落葉凋零

453
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:04,260
隔著岸邊埋藏的漂流堤 不忍安靜

454
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:11,260
漫長的孤瀧獻給自己

455
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,260
我 已無關於你

456
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:24,260
若海 卻刻你背影 也無所假意

457
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:31,260
化我為雲 流片刻曾經

458
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,260
若愛如夢幻泡影 夢中這聲音

459
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,260
我願長眠在你懷裡

460
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,260
我海外的晚風起 陪我游向你

461
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:58,260
我願化作 游半海的景

462
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,260
我愛如晚風中雨 片刻不忍聽

463
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:11,260
隨風混散我的痕跡

464
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,260
