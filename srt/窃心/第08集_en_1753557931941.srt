1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're lying to me.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're lying to me.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You were close to Lu Si Yan

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You were close to Lu Si Yan

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
for the sake of the Lu family's property.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But now you've fallen in love with him.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's your brother.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He's your brother.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't you feel disgusted?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't you feel disgusted?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just playing with him.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm just playing with him.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Lu Si Yan is not my brother.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Lu Si Yan is not my brother.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In my eyes,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Lu Si Yan is useful.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Chunying, I can fight the world for you.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chunying, I can fight the world for you.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Chunying,

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Chunying, never betray me.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,560
Mia Wuyi

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,800
This is what I bought.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,300
Thanks.

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,580
I've handed all the gifts to Mr. Gao

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,740
He's happy.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,220
Not多久 early para樣他不在手

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,200
Your father said

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
at the end of the month he'd Leon

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
to announce my identity to everyone.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,880
I plan to go to Wenrou Township to study Xiaorong.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
But before that,

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,120
I have to drive Boss Gao out of Lu's Mansion first.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,040
Okay.

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Let's go.

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
Father-in-law,

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,280
this is the book I brought back from abroad.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,120
You can read it if you have time.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,480
Okay.

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,320
Father, mother.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Zi Yan, Chuning,

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,240
your brother-in-law is discussing the engagement with me.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,520
We are a family now.

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,520
You should be more careful.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
Father-in-law,

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
I went to the mountain to meet the mountain.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,920
I want to marry Chuning.

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,560
Father-in-law,

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,840
you have a daughter.

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,840
What?

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Do you want us to be a couple?

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Father-in-law,

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
you promised me to marry the daughter of Lu family.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Now the daughter of Lu family is Lu Chuning.

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Father-in-law,

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,840
you are a respectable businessman.

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,640
Now I am the director of the police station.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,520
It's not good to take revenge.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't be so formal with me.

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,360
Don't forget how you came here.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,520
Welcome the new director.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
Welcome the new director.

75
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Welcome the new director.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,880
I can let you go up,

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
but I can let you down.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,040
Father-in-law,

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,480
your son has a lot of experience

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
as a young master of the Lu family.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,120
But I am different.

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
I am a chess player.

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Now I am in my position.

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
If you want to challenge me,

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,880
you should be more careful.

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,640
You...

87
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Let's go.

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,760
You can't marry her.

89
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,680
Your engagement with Xiao Jing

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,440
is now known by the whole city.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,960
The girl is the most important.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,120
Now the two of our Lu family are famous.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Do you want them to be the

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
I have to be rude to you.

95
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,960
I am not rude.

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,400
I have no blood relationship with the Lu family.

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
To be honest,

98
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,720
I have a relationship with Chuning.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Bullshit.

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
I should have killed you.

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Wait.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
Say what you said just now.

103
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,960
What did you say?

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,440
Li Li,

105
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
blame me if you want to blame me.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,640
I can't control my daughter

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,640
from the way she loves me.

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,480
But I really didn't know

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
she was your daughter.

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
I am a cook in the city.

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
But don't worry.

112
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
I will take care of her

113
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
in the rest of her life.

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
I will raise her.

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
What's going on?

116
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,640
Father, do you believe her?

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,840
The

118
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Master,

119
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
we have a way

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
to verify whether it is over.

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm afraid you will be wronged.

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,640
You have no right to do that

123
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
if you want to prove your innocence.

124
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,000
What else can be wronged

125
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
by her?

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,720
Si Yan,

127
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
it's about the girl's reputation.

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,160
If you care about your sister,

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
you shouldn't stop her.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
Okay, Father.

131
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
I will go with them.

132
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Miss, I need your blood.

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Si Yan, come with me.

134
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Please, Miss.

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,720
Father, listen to me.

136
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
Don't blame me.

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,880
You know I have a hobby.

138
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,000
I really didn't know

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
she was your daughter.

140
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,000
So I...

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Shut up.

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,120
Here.

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,720
This is Miss's blood.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Put the blood on the yellow flower

145
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
with the cold bag.

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,520
If there is nothing wrong with the flower,

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,320
it's over.

148
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,600
If the flower withers,

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
it's a loss.

150
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Father.

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't call me father.

152
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,440
I don't have a shameless daughter like you.

153
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,360
Father,

154
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
I'm willing to marry Chuning.

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,560
You really don't mind Chuning?

156
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,760
I, Shen Mochen, swear

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
I will be a man of honor,

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
a man of honor,

159
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,080
and marry Chuning

160
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
with a good marriage.

161
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
Are you still not talking?

162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
If you don't talk,

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
you will be sentenced to death.

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
Uncle,

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
you just said

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,480
I have a relative with you.

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,080
Then may I ask

168
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
if the birthmark of my waist

169
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,760
is on the left or the right?

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Birthmark...

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,680
On...

172
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
On the left.

173
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,280
Wrong.

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
On the right.

175
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
The blood that my mother took for me

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,120
was seen.

177
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
Am I right?

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes.

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
It's on the right.

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,800
Wrong again.

181
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,360
There is no birthmark on my waist.

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,000
Why did you lie?

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
I didn't pay much attention

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,440
when I was drawing blood.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,520
Chuning,

186
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
even if it's not your uncle who broke your body,

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,000
you are not finished.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,320
It's a fact that you don't argue.

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,920
A daughter should love herself.

190
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,360
You should live a good life with Mochen.

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Don't bother yourself again.

192
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,120
Mother is right.

193
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
A girl should love herself.

194
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
But the blood just now was holy.

195
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
I am a phoenix,

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
but I am innocent.

197
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,320
Father,

198
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
you must help me.

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,920
I was afraid someone would break it,

200
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,440
so I changed the needle.

201
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
But look at the yellow flower.

202
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
It's still withered.

203
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
It means

204
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,960
someone deliberately

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,840
wanted to make me innocent.

206
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
It's so shameful.

207
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
It's so cruel, father.

208
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,280
What's wrong with my mother?

209
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Tell me.

210
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,920
Master,

211
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,720
I...

212
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,160
I was blinded by a ghost.

213
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,000
I...

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
I took advantage of Boss Gao.

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,080
You...

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,160
You are talking nonsense.

217
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,520
When did I give you any advantage?

218
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,480
Brother,

219
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,280
listen to me.

220
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,920
Shut up.

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
Don't call me brother.

222
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
From now on,

223
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
we have no relationship with the Lu family.

224
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,720
Get out.

225
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
And you,

226
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,120
you two get out of the Lu family.

227
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,720
Get out.

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,720
Let's go.

229
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Don't you feel

230
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Since Boss Gao was driven away,

231
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
has the air in Lu's mansion become fresh?

232
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
For me,

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
the air in Lu's mansion has changed.

234
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Since you entered the Lu family,

235
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
my life has become lively.

236
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Thank you.

237
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
You're welcome.

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Anyway, that's all I have.

239
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
That's all?

240
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
You heard it all.

241
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
What did I hear?

242
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Explain it.

243
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Forget it.

244
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
There's nothing to explain.

245
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Anyway, I will marry Shen Mochen.

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
What if I say I disagree?

247
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
What identity do you have to say you disagree?

248
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I don't want to agree.

249
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
You...

250
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Are you really going to say it so honestly?

251
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
You like it so much.

252
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
One set in front of you, one set behind you.

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
That's why Shen Mochen was fooled by you.

254
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Right?

255
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I admit

256
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I did fall in love with you.

257
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
But so what?

258
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I want to save Rou.

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I want to raise Yu Yingtang.

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I also have to be on guard against your parents.

261
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Love is too extravagant for me.

262
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
I don't have time or willpower.

263
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I have to save Rou.

264
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Master Luo, please leave.

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I want to leave after I use it.

266
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Your love is too much

267
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm just waiting for the fourth time

268
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Who can leave without saying goodbye

269
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
You are the one who is beautiful

270
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Lin Chunni

271
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I won't let you marry someone else.

272
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Lin Chunni

273
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
What do you mean by this money?

274
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Apologize.

275
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
If you can drive me out of the Lu family

276
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Don't use money to find me Yan He.

277
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
You think

278
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
If I didn't save Rou

279
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
I would care about you?

280
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
I didn't cut you into pieces

281
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
You should be very grateful.

282
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
To be honest

283
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I drove you out of the Lu family

284
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
To make it easier to secretly go to the Chen Cang

285
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
To transfer the property

286
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
During this period

287
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
You'd better serve Rou well.

288
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Otherwise, I will never let you live well.

289
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
As long as you cooperate well

290
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I will change this bird cage to gold sooner or later.

291
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Which one is beautiful?

292
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
All beautiful

293
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Wrap all the ones I chose for Wenqi.

294
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Miss

295
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
The young master ordered

296
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
If you and Director Shen come to make a bet

297
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Or a wedding

298
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Not selling

299
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Yes

300
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Let's see the rest.

301
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
This is not bad.

302
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
You can help me take it out and have a look.

303
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
No need to see

304
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Hold this for me.

305
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
The young master ordered

306
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
As long as it's you, it's not for sale.

307
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
It's okay.

308
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Let's see the rest.

309
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Not for sale

310
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I bought it myself.

311
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
The young master ordered

312
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
As long as you and Director Shen are together

313
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Not for sale

314
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Chuning, it's okay.

315
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
The department store is not only Lu's.

316
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Let's go to the other stores.

317
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
There are many department stores.

318
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
But Lin Chuning is the only one.

319
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
She can't be included.

320
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Everything in Lu's department store belongs to her.

321
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
What she wants in the future

322
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Take it directly to her room.

323
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Brother

324
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'm going to marry your sister soon.

325
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Your sister adores you so much.

326
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Today's matter

327
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I won't be as strange as you.

328
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Me and my sister's matter

329
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
It's not your turn to care.

330
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You haven't married my sister yet.

331
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Don't interfere with our matter.

332
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Lu Da Shao

333
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Where have you been these days?

334
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
You don't come to me.

335
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I miss you so much.

336
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Didn't you see me talking?

337
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Take it away.

338
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I don't need this.

339
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Chuning

340
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Mosheng

341
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Let's go.

342
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Please make way.

343
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Thank you.

344
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
You're welcome.

345
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm going to the other store.

346
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Please make way.

347
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Thank you.

348
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Master Lu

349
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Get out.

350
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Chuning

351
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I didn't mean to do that day.

352
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
But I didn't expect

353
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
You are still willing to marry me.

354
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Mosheng

355
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
That day

356
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
You have a good deal with Boss Gao.

357
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Xiao Jing is my father's pearl.

358
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
If you break the engagement in vain

359
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
You will be in trouble.

360
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm sorry.

367
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
If you break the engagement in vain

368
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
And change to me

369
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
My father will not agree.

370
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
But if I tell the truth

371
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I will still go with Boss Gao.

372
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
My father wants to cover up for his family.

373
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
He can only wrong his daughter.

374
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
So

375
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm just being abandoned by you three.

376
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Chuning

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I will never abandon you.

378
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
And only I will not abandon you.

379
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Whether it's the Lu family

380
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Or the Lu Si Yan

381
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
They can't be trusted.

382
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
But I'm different.

383
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
No matter what you did

384
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Or what you want to do

385
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,160
I will always stand behind you.

386
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
It's getting late.

387
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Go back and prepare the engagement banquet.

388
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Okay.

389
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I'm looking forward to that day.

390
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Okay.

391
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
You like eavesdropping so much.

392
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,160
It seems that you don't believe him that much.

393
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I don't believe him.

394
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
I don't believe you either.

395
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I don't think you don't believe me.

396
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
At first you wanted to fake the engagement banquet

397
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
To save Xiaorou.

398
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
But because Shen Mochen and Uncle Da

399
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
So noisy

400
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Also cancelled the engagement banquet.

401
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
You just want to push the boat.

402
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Let Shen Mochen give you a engagement banquet.

403
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Am I right?

404
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Yes.

405
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
But it doesn't mean

406
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I will marry you.

407
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You didn't want to use me

408
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
As your lowly brother.

409
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
To resist your parents.

410
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
You already knew

411
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
It's impossible between us.

412
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Possible or impossible

413
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
It's not about identity.

414
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
It's just about feelings.

415
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
I didn't love you before.

416
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Now I love you very much.

417
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
So your identity is not important.

418
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
But it's because Boss Gao didn't succeed.

419
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
But I

420
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I know you don't have the confidence to talk about love.

421
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I just want to stand in the right place.

422
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
When you finish your work

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
I will wait for you.

424
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Your next life

425
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
I will always be with you.

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
And I want to say

427
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Just like this flashlight.

428
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I hope

429
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I can be the light in your heart.

430
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,160
The red beans are as green as the end of the dream.

431
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Let me walk hand in hand.

432
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
The horse is concerned about the heart.

433
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Lin Chuning is not out for a day.

434
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Si Yan is in danger for another day.

435
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Lin Chuning

436
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
You shouldn't be so close to your brother.

437
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
And you shouldn't come back.

438
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Chuning, don't be afraid.

439
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
I will always be with you.

440
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Lu Si Yan

441
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Thank you.

442
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Xiao Jing knew that you and Chuning were going to get engaged.

443
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
She had a fight with me for a long time.

444
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Both are my daughters.

445
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I am also very difficult to be a mother.

446
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
It's all my fault.

447
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
It's all my fault.

448
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I made my parents worried.

449
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
What's wrong with loving someone?

450
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Chuning has suffered a lot since she was a child.

451
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Please take good care of her for us in the future.

452
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Don't worry, mother-in-law.

453
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I think the same as my mother-in-law.

454
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Let me take care of Chuning.

455
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Okay, Chuning is waiting for you in the workshop.

456
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Go ahead.

457
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Mother-in-law, I am leaving.

458
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Tell the lady to go to the workshop.

459
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Tell her that young master has something to do.

460
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Yes.

461
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
We met countless times in the past.

462
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
It's hard to remember.

463
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,160
I left a strong memory for myself.

464
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I don't care about you.

465
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
If the sea can cut your back,

466
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
I will be your shadow.

467
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
I am the only one.

468
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Have you ever been in love?

469
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
If love is like a dream,

470
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I want to be with you.

471
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I want to be in your arms forever.

472
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,160
So you can be with me forever.

473
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
I will be your shadow.

474
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,160
I will be your shadow forever.

475
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Have you ever been in love?

476
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I want to be with you.

477
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I want to be your shadow forever.

478
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I will be your shadow forever.

479
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Like the evening wind and autumn rain, the sky can't be stopped

480
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,160
The wind is blowing away my memories

481
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:25,160
The wind is blowing away my memories
