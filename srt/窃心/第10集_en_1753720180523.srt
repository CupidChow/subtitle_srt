1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Young Master, it's so big inside.

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
You'll die even if you go in.

3
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Even if I die,

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
I'll die with her.

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
Young Master!

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Young Master!

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I can't get her.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
No one wants to get her.

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
You can be a bunch of ghostly rascals

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
in the basement.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Young Master!

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Rong.

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Chong Ning!

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Chong Ning!

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Chong Ning!

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Chong Ning!

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Chong Ning!

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Chong Ning!

19
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
It's okay.

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll take you home.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Let's go.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I'll put you down.

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
The door is locked.

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Are we going to die here?

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Don't worry.

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
We won't die.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Gao Yunfeng will always find a way out.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Follow the wind.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
We'll find a way out.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hold on.

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
We can get out.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
It should be here.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Okay.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I can walk on my own.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Are you afraid of the strange things?

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Chong Ning!

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let me down.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Why are you so concerned about Mochan?

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I don't want others to gossip about me.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go and save her.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Chong Ning.

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Are you okay?

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll take you home.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll take her home.

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll take you home.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Go to hell!

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
You bitch.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,800
Do you think you can survive

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
if Lin Chuning becomes the daughter of Lu family?

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
No.

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm telling you.

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
It's all a dream.

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
A dream!

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Tell me.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
If I

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
tell Lin Chuning

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
that you cheated the little kids

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
of Yuying Hall for your own good,

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
will she still treat you as her sister?

64
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't want to leave you.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
I wanted to steal the account book for you.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
The account book wasn't burned by Lin Chuning.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Yes.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
Lin Chuning burned your gentle incense.

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Don't you want to take revenge?

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
I can only become your weapon

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
when I return to her.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Maybe I can kill her.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Lin Chuning.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
You'd better not lie to me.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Otherwise,

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
your photos

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,800
will be posted on the streets.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Gao Yunfeng.

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
You'd better die.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Great.

81
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
With this account book,

82
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
we can send Boss Gao to prison.

83
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm afraid he won't live a long life.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm afraid he won't live a long life.

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Miss, someone asked me to give this to you.

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You want to exchange the account book for a small one?

87
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
What's wrong?

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Nothing.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Lin Chuning

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You killed Lin Chuning for me.

91
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I can give you what she can give you.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I want to die more than you do.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Chuning.

94
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Xiaorou.

95
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Give me the account book.

96
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
You're so reckless.

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Even if you make it this time,

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
you'll be in a worse situation next time.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Give me the account book, or I'll kill her.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Chuning, don't give it to her.

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Shut up.

102
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Get up.

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Get up.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Chuning.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Chuning.

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Let her go.

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Chuning.

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Lin Chuning.

109
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
You ruined my gentle fragrance.

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
You ruined everything about me.

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll send you to hell today.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Boss.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
You're here.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Sister.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
It's okay.

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Sister?

117
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Actually, you're the real lady of the Lu family.

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
And you're Si Yan's sister.

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
You suffered so much after being so drunk.

120
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Now you tell me that I'm the lady of the Lu family.

121
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
You're the real lady of the Lu family.

122
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
You're the real sister of the Shaodong family.

123
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
What's the point of suffering all these years?

124
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Xiaorou.

125
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
All the pain is gone.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
You only have one day left.

127
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You're so naive.

128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You took my position.

129
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
You played the piano with my brother and said you loved him.

130
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
How could you understand my feelings?

131
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Sister.

132
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Don't say that.

133
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Chuning has been doing this for you.

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Whether she wanted to avenge you at first,

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
or she saved you later,

136
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
everything is for you.

137
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
You can't say that.

138
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
For me?

139
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
My life is ruined.

140
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
So what if she saves me?

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
It's just a walk in the park.

142
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Si Yan.

143
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Can you leave for a while?

144
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I have something to tell Chuning.

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Is there anything I can't hear?

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Si Yan.

147
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
You go back first.

148
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Okay.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Take your time.

150
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Xiaorou.

151
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Don't worry.

152
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
As long as I'm here,

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
no one will bully you anymore.

154
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Chuning.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Can you promise me one thing?

156
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
As long as I can do it,

157
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I will do it for you.

158
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Can you never be with Lu Si Yan?

159
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
You still say you are my best sister.

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I don't even care about your status.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
But you can't even do this little thing.

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Lin Chuning.

163
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
You know what I've been through.

164
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
But now Si Yan has become my brother.

165
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
My life is already bitter enough.

166
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Chuning.

167
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
You can't do this.

168
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
You can't do this.

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm leaving.

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Chuning.

171
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Can you give me a little more time?

172
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Please, Chuning.

173
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Xiaorou.

174
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Let's go home first.

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
We'll talk about this later.

176
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
The End

177
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Soon everything here will be mine.

178
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Lin Chuning.

179
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
You should pay for what you owe me with your life.

180
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Xiaorou.

181
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Watch your hands.

182
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Chuning.

183
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
I accidentally broke your sachet.

184
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Chuning.

185
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
It's all my fault.

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I hurt my hand to save you.

187
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I can't even hold the sachet.

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
What does that have to do with it?

189
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
By the way,

190
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
I've already told Master Lu and Mrs. Lu.

191
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
They said your family is in trouble.

192
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
They temporarily live here.

193
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Someone wanted to kill me before.

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I suspect that it's because of the identity of the Miss Lu.

195
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Once I'm sure I've solved the crisis,

196
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I'll return the identity to you.

197
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Chuning.

198
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Aren't you curious about what I've been through?

199
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Xiaorou.

200
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
This is your sad part.

201
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
If you don't want to say it,

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I want to say it.

203
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I want you to know how miserable I was.

204
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I was so miserable.

205
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
At that time,

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I was bought a house for you.

207
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
But I was taken by Boss Gao.

208
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I met Mr. Lu there.

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I thought I was with him all night.

210
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
When I was pregnant,

211
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I ran out desperately.

212
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I ran to the Yuying Hall to find you.

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
But I didn't expect that

214
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Boss Gao had caught up with the Yuying Hall.

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Chuning.

216
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Chuning.

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Chuning, where are you?

218
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Xiaorou.

219
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I knew you would come here.

220
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Let me go.

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Let me go.

222
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Do you think you can marry the man who married Lu Siyan

223
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,800
and marry him into the Lu family?

224
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
He and you are just playing.

225
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Lu Siyan.

226
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Duotai Yao.

227
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Lu Siyan made this for you.

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't take this love story too seriously.

229
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
It's a pity.

230
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Xiaorou.

231
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm actually helping you.

232
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Lu Siyan asked me to do all these.

233
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
If you want to blame,

234
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
blame Lu Siyan.

235
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Xiaorou.

236
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Xiaorou.

237
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Xiaorou.

238
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Xiaorou.

239
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Xiaorou.

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Xiaorou, what's wrong?

241
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Don't scare me.

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Lu Siyan doesn't want our child.

243
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm so stupid.

244
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Help me hold on.

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Xiaorou.

246
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Xiaorou.

247
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Xiaorou.

248
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Xiaorou.

249
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Xiaorou.

250
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Xiaorou.

251
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Xiaorou.

252
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Chuning.

253
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Chuning.

254
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Xiaorou.

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Xiaorou.

256
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
What's wrong with Xiaorou?

257
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I don't know.

258
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
It's all my fault.

259
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
It's all my fault that I didn't protect her well.

260
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
No.

261
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
No.

262
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
It's Lu Siyan.

263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
It's Lu Siyan.

264
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
She hurt her.

265
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
She hurt Xiaorou.

266
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
It's all her fault.

267
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Poor child.

268
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Chuning.

269
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
You and Xiaorou

270
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
are all the children I watched when I was a child.

271
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm half of your parents.

272
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Leave Xiaorou's funeral to me.

273
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Take care of the other sisters.

274
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Don't let them know

275
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
that they are still young.

276
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
They can't stand such a blow.

277
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Don't tell them.

278
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Xiaorou.

279
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Xiaorou.

280
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Lu Siyan.

281
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I will kill you

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
and avenge Xiaorou.

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Did you think

284
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
that you were dead?

285
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
It's a pity

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
that you are not dead at all.

287
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You are not dead at all.

288
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
You are dead.

289
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
It's not what you think.

290
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
You are dead.

291
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I don't want to die.

292
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
But you are dead.

293
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You are dead.

294
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
You are dead.

295
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
You are dead.

296
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm dead.

297
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm dead.

298
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
You devil.

299
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Only those who are disobedient will think this is hell.

300
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
From now on, you can only stay here.

301
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,800
You should really thank our child.

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
He died for you.

303
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Our child? What do you mean?

304
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I don't have to hide it from you.

305
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,800
The one who was with you that night was not Lu Si Yan.

306
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Lu Si Yan never touched you.

307
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I was the one who was with you that night.

308
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm much better than Lu Si Yan.

309
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Since our child protected you,

310
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
then you should stay with me.

311
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
You're so strong, you might forget me.

312
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm going to find Chuning.

313
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Chuning...

314
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Stupid.

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Think about why you're here.

316
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Your good sister handed you over to me.

317
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
It was all my fault.

319
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I'll listen to you from now on.

320
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Why did you let me do this?

321
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
That's the way to behave.

322
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I wasn't dead.

323
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Boss Gao lied to you and hid me.

324
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
But he actually took me back to Wen Rou.

325
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I had to try my best to please him.

326
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I was forced to die.

327
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I was about to become his?

328
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Chuning...

329
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,800
My life has been ruined by you and Lu Si Yan.

330
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
How can you two still be together?

331
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I've been through so much.

332
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I can't be stressed.

333
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I should leave Lu family for now.

334
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Chuning...

335
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Si Yan, Lin Chuning has left.

336
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
What do you mean?

337
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
She told me last night

338
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
that she came to Lu family to save you.

339
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Now I'm back.

340
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
She can be with Mo Chen.

341
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
She can't be.

342
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
She and Shen Mo Chen have been together since childhood.

343
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Don't look for her.

344
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
You won't find her.

345
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I'll find her.

346
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Si Yan!

347
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Si Yan!

348
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,800
I don't care about you

349
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
If the sea can cut your back

350
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
The sky is not a fake

351
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
I'm the only one

352
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Have you ever lost a piece of paper?

353
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
If love is like a dream, it's like a treasure

354
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
In the dream, we are like each other

355
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,800
I'm willing to be in your arms

356
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm going to create a sea of words that you don't know

357
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm going to fill the whole world with my own land

358
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You are like a bridge that crosses the Anqiao River

359
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm only close to you

360
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I met the bottom of the sea

361
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Like a fallen leaf

362
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,800
The floating skin buried in the shore

363
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I can't help but ask

364
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I have to give myself a lot of pain

365
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I care about you

366
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,800
If the sea can cut your back

367
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
The sky is not a fake

368
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm the only one

369
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Have you ever lost a piece of paper?

370
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
If love is like a dream, it's like a treasure

371
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
In the dream, we are like each other

372
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm willing to be in your arms

373
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,800
The evening wind blows

374
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I miss you again

375
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I'm willing to be a chicken in the middle of the sea

376
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
If love is like a rain in the evening wind

377
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
The sky can't be stopped

378
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
The wind is like a river

379
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
The wind is like a river

380
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm willing to be a chicken in the middle of the sea

381
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,800
If love is like a dream, it's like a treasure

382
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
In the dream, we are like each other

383
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm willing to be a chicken in the middle of the sea

384
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,800
If love is like a rain in the evening wind

385
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
The sky is not a fake
