1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,400
We have recherche rule

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Keep searching.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Even if you search the whole city,

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
you will find him.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's because of Shen Wei that Liu Pinggang gave up.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is he that important to you?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where are you going?

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Liu Pinggang

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Liu Pinggang

10
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let go of me!

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Li Chunni

12
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Li Chunni

13
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Have you ever thought about

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
answering

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
answering

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm really not here.

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can go now.

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Li Chunni

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Li Chunni

20
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I came here to apologize today.

21
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I invited everyone to come to the Changxi Palace.

22
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm very grateful.

23
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Chunni, don't worry.

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will make up for you with a grand wedding ceremony.

25
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's cancel the engagement.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What did you say?

27
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Our engagement was not pure.

28
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You used Boss Gao's hand to design me.

29
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I used your hand to design Boss Gao.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's even.

31
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is really my fault.

32
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I shouldn't have designed with Boss Gao.

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I want to marry you. It's true.

34
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We are already using each other and designing each other.

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So there is no forgiveness.

36
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, then I'll just pretend you forgive me.

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll just pretend you forgive me.

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
From today on, I can pursue you.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Since ancient times, the third person has not had a good ending.

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For example, Ma Wencai

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Forced to break up Liangshan Bohe Zhu Yunkai

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Not only did not hold the beauty,

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He also left a long-standing curse.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But do you know

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Parents' fate is not only

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The real family is Ma Wencai and Zhu Yingtai.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Liangshan Bo is forced.

48
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If he had not been stubborn,

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How would he have been involved in the marriage of Yingtai and him?

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Liangshan Bo and Zhu Yingtai are not the Shus of the Li family.

51
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bravely pursue true love.

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Even if they eventually turn into enemies

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think they are free.

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's better than being trapped in a cage for a lifetime.

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The beauty is famous, the painting is different.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think they are flying geese.

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Who do you say is flying geese?

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Enough.

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I heard you two quarreling here.

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Still watching the play here.

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can go back.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Liangxiu

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let me go.

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why did you ask me to find a little girl?

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not Zhu Yingtai.

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will not give up everything for love.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not Liangshan Bo.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will make a good result.

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you dare to say you don't love me now?

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Love and hatred are the same in the world of laughter.

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Life and death are the same.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No hatred.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In this life, no one is the same.

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Bring the next life.

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Need to be close.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Chu Ning

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Chu Ning

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

80
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Chu Ning

81
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Chu Ning

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Chu Ning

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe we can cooperate.

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Xiaorou, this is your home.

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Even if you want to go, I will go.

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are my best sister.

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are my closest brother.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why do you two tease me like this?

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Chu Ning

90
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You promised me that you would break up with Siyan.

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Chu Ning

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I beg you.

93
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You and Siyan break up, okay?

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Xiaorou

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Xiaorou

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I never promised you.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will never promise you.

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You took my identity away.

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And took away my favorite person.

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Now you don't want to return anything to me.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yin Chu Ning

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If this is the case

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I would rather die in Wenrou Village.

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Xiaorou

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Xiaorou

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Xiaorou

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I would rather die.

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't want to see you and Lu Siyan kiss.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I came to Lu Siyan to save you.

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I came to the Lu family to save you.

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But now

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are out of trouble.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But I can also go back to the city.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I know you don't want to see me again.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I will return your identity as soon as possible.

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Xiaorou

117
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You are making a mess.

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You promised to marry Shen Mochen.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And you are going to cancel the engagement.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You are just playing with marriage.

121
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Father

122
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I will tell you the truth.

123
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The reason why I will marry Shen Mochen

124
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is because

125
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Someone in the house wants to kill me.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What did you say?

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I just want to protect myself.

128
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to live a stable life.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have to make a plan.

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who is the person who dares to kill my daughter?

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know.

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But now I'm not afraid.

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because I have met one.

134
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The one who can protect me for the rest of my life.

135
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
With him

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No one can hurt me.

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Who are you with again?

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Master

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My daughter has grown up.

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's normal to be lonely.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's not always care about her.

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mother

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are you talking about?

144
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The person I'm talking about

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Is Siyan.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Father

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Siyan and I are brothers.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
With such a good brother

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We have a lot of blessings.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You two are close.

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I am very happy.

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But you will have to get married in the future.

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You should pay attention to these things.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't make any rumors.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay, father.

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Siyan has her own sense.

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Master, don't worry.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you think this is okay?

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Mochen

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I still want to tell you and mother.

162
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I see Lin Chuning and my brother

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Very close

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
After all

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You are going to get married to Lin Chuning.

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I want to get married to another woman.

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to get this out of my head.

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And ruin my good things.

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You are a big girl.

171
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You are really a bitch.

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mochen

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mochen

174
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you a team?

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, it must be Lin Chuning who ordered you to do this.

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right?

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You just want to marry the big girl of the Lu family.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I am the real big girl of the Lu family.

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Tell you

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I married Lin Chuning

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
She is the big girl of the Lu family.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But you are different.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If you are not the big girl of the Lu family

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I won't look at you one more time.

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't believe

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Lin Chuning must have seduced you.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mochen

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Look

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is the first gift you gave me.

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You said I was like a pearl

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
White and innocent

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I will buy you a drink.

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You believe men.

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are really stupid.

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No, don't open it.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Get out of my way.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why?

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Have you ever loved me?

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Never.

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You are so stupid.

202

Jing said

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He has realized

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I thank you for him.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He didn't expose you in front of your father.

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He wants to kill you.

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If someone bullies you

208
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You must tell me.

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I will support you.

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I never expect

211
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I can have a family.

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And my parents will love me.

213
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You are my child.

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I love you.

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not necessary.

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You love me.

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not necessary.

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But you

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why do you want to kill me?

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't call someone to kill me.

221

Jing said

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But I don't believe him.

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He must be bullied.

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He wants to stir up our relationship.

225
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think so.

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But thank you.

227
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You have a good son.

228
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He is really good.

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You shouldn't come back.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You should take my life.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You have lived for 20 years.

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You are my son.

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You deserve it.

236
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000

239
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
You almost died, you know?

240
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
I'm not stupid. I can swim.

241
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
Which one do you want? Change it.

242
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I'm not going to change it.

243
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm going to change it.

244
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
I'm going to change it.

245
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Why do you have a woman's clothes?

246
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I can't go back to my room for now.

247
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,260
I didn't call your mother.

248
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,260
You can go back to your room.

249
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
I'm going to change it.

250
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
You're a lonely man.

251
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
He loves swimming.

252
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,260
He makes me a sweet and lonely man.

253
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:06,680
You're a

254
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
I've already got your mother's ID.

255
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,680
I told her that as long as I can leave the Lu family safely,

256
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I'll tell your father that I'm a lowly man.

257
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,680
I know your mother just wants to drag you.

258
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Look, I'm just a woman who doesn't know how to do anything.

259
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
If you're afraid, you can escape.

260
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm afraid.

261
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
I'm just afraid you're in danger.

262
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,680
What makes me feel the most uncomfortable now is to kill you.

263
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
You're my mother.

264
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
I'll try to protect you.

265
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
But before that,

266
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
you have to promise me

267
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
don't take any more risks, okay?
