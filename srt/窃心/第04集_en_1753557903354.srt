1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,420
emed

2
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,820
It's me, Chu Ning.

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,180
Did you kill him?

4
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,140
Boss Gao is Lu Si Yan's uncle.

5
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,900
He must have a relationship with Wen Ruoxiang.

6
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,140
If he tells Lu Si Yan,

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,220
we'll be done for.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,220
I'm not a big deal.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,820
Your grandpa took me back to the Lu family to get blood.

10
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,660
But not long after,

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,020
your father came to save me.

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,940
I didn't even change my surname.

13
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,820
My surname is Gao.

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,660
In Lu Si Yan's eyes,

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,740
we're all outsiders.

16
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,540
Mo Chenge,

17
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,340
Boss Gao has been getting close to Yuying Drugstore.

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,140
I can't take the blame.

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,980
But just in case,

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,620
let's tie Boss Gao up first.

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,860
Boss Gao,

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
let's make it up to you for the time being.

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,220
We'll deal with you after we get rid of Lu Si Yan.

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,500
Lu Si Yan,

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,260
Chu Ning,

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,060
our grudge should be resolved.

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,740
Brother,

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,420
do you know Wen Ruoxiang?

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,900
Mo Chenge,

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,780
use Wen Ruoxiang's information to trick Lu Si Yan out of the city.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,540
He'll come to cover up Wen Ruoxiang's secret.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,300
Chu Ning,

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,740
he found Wen Ruoxiang's secret

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,940
and talked to Wen Ruoxiang's boss

35
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,300
for secretly trading in the testing primary storage

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,740
it was in the morning

37
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,940
and he still hasn't come back.

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,220
I suspect he met with some troubles.

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,780
Let's go together!

40
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,540
Lu Si Yan is good at defense,

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,820
bear this in mind.

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
Don't kill him.

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,380
I must win.

44
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,220
Starting from him, I must take revenge on myself.

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,060
Lu Si Yan.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,520
I said

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,680
I would take revenge on my tribe pony until you're dead.

48
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,380
In the future, Lu Si Yan will be trapped in the dark dungeon.

49
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,380
I, Ling Ru, will be the only one who can save him.

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Lin Shu Ning!

51
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Lin Shu Ning!

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Lin Shu Ning!

53
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Stop!

54
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
Or I'll kill him!

55
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,380
You threatened him with me, but it's useless.

56
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,380
I'll try. How do you know it's useless?

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Do you think I care about him?

58
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
Kneel! I told you to kneel!

59
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I told you to kneel!

60
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Lu Si Yan, I'll kill you!

61
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
So you wanted to kill me.

62
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
You're awake.

63
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Lu Si Yan

64
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Lu Si Yan

65
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
I set this trap, didn't I?

66
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
What were you going to do to me?

67
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,380
What you want to do to me now is what I want to do.

68
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,380
I want to save you. You want to kill me.

69
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Stop pretending.

70
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Let me ask you.

71
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Why is my watch on you?

72
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
You... you just...

73
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Let me ask you.

74
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,380
Why are you hiding my watch?

75
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,380
Don't you know?

76
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
What do you mean?

77
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Lu Si Yan, you're a loser.

78
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,380
Xiaorou and I, even if we go to hell, we won't let you go.

79
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Xiaorou?

80
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,380
You gave the watch to someone else.

81
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,380
You don't even remember the name.

82
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
I just lost this watch.

83
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
You mean Xiaorou?

84
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,380
Could it be...

85
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Wake up.

86
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Wake up.

87
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
Call her out.

88
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,380
You used to like to call me.

89
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Now you don't.

90
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Call her out.

91
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Call her or not, I'll let you call her.

92
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Don't go.

93
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Please.

94
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Please.

95
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Please.

96
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,380
You bitch.

97
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
I'll teach you a lesson.

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Please.

99
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Who are you?

100
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
She's mine.

101
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Thank you.

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
The moon is here.

103
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
The moon is here.

104
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Young Master, you've been here twice.

105
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
You sit here and drink every time.

106
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,380
Do you dislike me?

107
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
I don't dislike you.

108
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Get up and sit.

109
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
I didn't do anything to her.

111
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
I was afraid she would do something again.

112
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,380
So I gave the money to Jiubao.

113
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
I never saw her again.

114
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380
No.

115
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
Xiaorou's safe button is a personal one.

116
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,380
If Lu Siyan really wants to see her,

117
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
it's unreasonable that she didn't find her safe button.

118
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
Did I misunderstand her?

119
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Maybe Xiaorou's pregnant with someone else's child.

120
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
But if Xiaorou didn't go with her,

121
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
how could she be sure that the child is hers?

122
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,380
What are you looking at?

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
I didn't look at you.

124
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,380
So you went into Wenrou Town

125
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
to find Xiaorou?

126
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Why did you go into Wenrou Town?

127
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,380
Of course to find the mastermind behind the scenes.

128
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
To avoid more innocent people from getting hurt.

129
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
What about now?

130
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
Did you find her?

131
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Do you remember

132
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
the orchid at the door of Wenrou Town's study?

133
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,380
It's hard to grow flowers there.

134
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
So I don't see it often.

135
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
One day, I went to my uncle

136
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
and smelled the orchid.

137
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,380
I followed him all the time.

138
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Then I came to the door of Wenrou Town's study.

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,380
Boss Gao?

140
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,380
I thought it was very dangerous.

141
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
But now I have to let you know.

142
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
Otherwise,

143
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,380
I don't know how you will deal with me.

144
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Let's stop joking.

145
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
No.

146
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
I can't believe anyone's face again.

147
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Then why did you save me?

148
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Aren't you my sister?

149
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Why didn't you kill me?

150
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
You are my sister.

151
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,380
Don't you not recognize me as your sister?

152
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Let's get to know each other again, Lu Siye.

153
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Lu Chuning.

154
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Director.

155
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
What are you doing?

156
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
Say it.

157
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Director, it's too late. Let's go.

158
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Wait.

159
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
I'll get you later.

160
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,380
Director.

161
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Director, there's too much fire.

162
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
Let Lu Zhen think they are going to kill each other.

163
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
Go.

164
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
You just go to the scene.

165
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Just let go of the power of the Winged King.

166
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Chuning.

167
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Director.

168
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Let me go.

169
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Director, I have something to report to you.

170
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Sanshun, how long have you been with me?

171
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Five years.

172
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Five years.

173
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
Five years.

174
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,380
Director, do you know what it means to be a bandit?

175
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
What is it called?

176
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,380
What is it called to listen to orders and do things?

177
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
What?

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
You have to do something like this.

179
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,380
Director, I'm doing this for your own good.

180
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,380
But do you know that this will kill Chuning?

181
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,380
I...

182
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,380
Okay, stop talking.

183
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Go.

184
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
Yes.

185
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
I will go.

186
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
Boss Gao.

187
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Why is Xiaorou's watch in your hands?

188
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
What are you talking about?

189
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
I've never seen this watch.

190
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,380
But this watch was found in your room.

191
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Or in your gentle room?

192
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Boss Gao.

193
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Boss Gao.

194
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
Is that you?

195
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
Boss Gao.

196
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Don't leave me.

197
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Boss Gao.

198
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
Boss Gao.

199
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Boss Gao.

200
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,380
Little boy.

201
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Little boy.

202
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Chuning.

203
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
You are really from the Lu family.

204
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
You are just like your father and your great grandfather.

205
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Smart and talented.

206
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
So you admit it?

207
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I admit it.

208
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
I admit it.

209
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,380
But what can you do to me?

210
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,380
You ordered this box, right?

211
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
You want to kill me?

212
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Yes.

213
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
I want to kill you.

214
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Do you feel itchy?

215
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
It's numb.

216
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
You...

217
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
This is not a secret box.

218
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
This is a blue box.

219
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,380
It's exactly the same box that Xiaorou ordered.

220
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,380
You sisters should have different boxes.

221
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Oh, right.

222
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Let me tell you again.

223
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,380
This box is my unique special.

224
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
You killed Xiaorou.

225
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
I want to kill you.

226
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
You want to kill me?

227
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
I also want to tell you.

228
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,380
Xiaorou's business has nothing to do with me.

229
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
She is not smart enough.

230
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,380
She wants to climb up the ladder.

231
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Chuning.

232
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Don't learn from her.

233
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Don't be afraid.

234
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
Be good.

235
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,380
I will treat you well.

236
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,380
My good life.

237
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
I like it.

238
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
I like your arrogant face.

239
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
What do you want?

240
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
I am uncle.

241
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
I am wrong.

242
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I will never do it again.

243
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
Siyan.

244
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Siyan, look.

245
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Look at her.

246
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Chuning, are you okay?

247
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I am hot.

248
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,380
Chuning.

249
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Chuning.

250
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Wake up.

251
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Siyan.

252
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
I know you are sad.

253
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
I will take you back.

254
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Are you feeling better?

255
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
I will put you down.

256
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
No.

257
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
Chuning.

258
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Do you know who I am?

259
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Siyan.

260
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Chuning.

261
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Chuning.

262
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Chuning.

263
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Don't do this.

264
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Siyan.

265
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Lin Chuning.

266
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,380
You are white.

267
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I owe you in my previous life.

268
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
No.

269
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Sleep.

270
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
No.

271
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
No.

272
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
It's a long journey.

273
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
If you catch a cold,

274
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
don't expect me to take care of you.

275
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Thank you.

276
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Sit.

277
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
If you don't mind,

278
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
let me help you.

279
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,380
It's so nice to have a brother.

280
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
It's so troublesome to have a sister.

281
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
You mean

282
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
someone in the police station

283
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
is in cahoots with Boss Gao?

284
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Should we tell Mocheng?

285
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
I don't know.

286
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
I don't know.

287
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
Don't tell him.

288
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I want to solve it myself.

289
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
And as far as I know,

290
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,380
the one in the police station

291
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
is Shen Mochen.

292
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Why do you say it's him?

293
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Shen Mochen

294
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,380
is very meticulous

295
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
and ambitious.

296
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
He wants to

297
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
meet my sister

298
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
and live a glorious life.

299
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
He is the chief of the police station.

300
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
My father bought him.

301
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
You don't look up to him.

302
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,380
It's not that I don't look up to him.

303
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
No one looks up to him.

304
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,380
So

305
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
I used the incense

306
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
to take you out of the city that day.

307
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,380
You are not worried about the plan being lost.

308
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,380
You are worried about my safety.

309
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
So, sister,

310
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
is it really because of Xiaorou

311
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,380
that you are so mean to me?

312
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Lu Siyan

313
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Lu Siyan is not to be trusted.

314
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Shen Mochen is not to be trusted.

315
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I can only believe in myself.

316
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:39,360
It's been nine days.

317
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Why doesn't Gu Haibot come to see me?

318
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,360
This pretty gal seems familiar.

319
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,380
It has to be something he can only drink.

320
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,360
I want to drink this.

321
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,320
Why didn't you ask him to call me last time?

322
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,240
Open this side.

323
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,240
What kind of хот estão?

324
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Stop.

326
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Are you new here?

327
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
I thought you were here to accompany me.

328
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Why are you here?

329
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Brother,

330
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,800
there are too many people.

331
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Let's go.

332
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll accompany you tonight.

333
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Why are you here?

334
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Why are you here too?

335
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Why are you acting alone again?

336
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Childish.

337
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Boss Gao killed Xiaorou.

338
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I can't let him go.

339
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
You are now the president of the Yuying Hall.

340
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
If anything happens to your son,

341
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
will you feel sorry for your sister?

342
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't worry.

343
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I will take care of them.

344
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Boss Gao must die.

345
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Baby,

346
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
have a good sleep tonight.

347
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Love Story

348
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm not concerned with you

349
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,800
If the sea can cut your back

350
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
The sky does not make a fake

351
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I am the only one

352
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Have you ever been

353
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
If love is like a dream

354
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I am willing to be in your arms

355
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I'm in the sea of ​​uncertainty

356
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
The whole world is in the ground

357
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
You keep the moon and fire in the dark

358
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm close to you

359
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
The road to the sea is narrow

360
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Like a fallen leaf

361
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,800
The river flows into the hidden river

362
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
No one is quiet

363
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Strong and strong

364
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
I have to give it to myself

365
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I am not concerned with you

366
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
If the sea can cut your back

367
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
The sky does not make a fake

368
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I am the only one

369
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Have you ever been

370
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,800
If love is like a dream

371
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
In the dream, the sound

372
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,800
I am willing to be in your arms

373
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm in the sea of ​​uncertainty

374
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
With me, I miss you again

375
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I am willing to turn into

376
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
The memory of the ocean

377
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,800
If love is like a wind

378
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
The sky does not make a fake

379
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
