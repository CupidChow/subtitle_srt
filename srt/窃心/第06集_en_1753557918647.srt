00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mr. Yan, Mrs. Yan.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The spirit stomach...

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
The spirit stomach is bleeding!

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
I heard that the second daughter is not pregnant.

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
The second daughter was born with a dead baby.

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,400
Today, the situation is out of control.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm afraid the ancestors are not willing to admit the second daughter.

9
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Otherwise, the Lu family will be in trouble.

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,000
Ridiculous!

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,200
I was born in February too.

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Why am I not pregnant?

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Is it because my sister is a woman?

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,760
Women create lives and carry everything.

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,520
If giving birth to a child is an ominous thing,

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,520
then the whole world will be a huge curse.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,600
If my sister is wandering outside,

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,320
and the 100% is not a good thing,

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,200
then I am born with peace and happiness,

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,480
but I am not thinking about marriage.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,240
Isn't it more ominous?

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,600
Si Yan, don't talk nonsense.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
I have a way.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Guards,

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,360
lock her up.

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,640
Yes.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
I prepared red eyes for the maid in advance.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
I will make you pay for your misdeeds.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
Lin Chu Ni, I will kill you!

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,400
No!

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,120
The court is noisy in the hall.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
How can you bow to me?

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
Don't worry, sister.

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm just praying for you.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
This time,

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,320
it's not because I'm not filial,

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,080
but because you were deceived by me.

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
Although you grew up under my mother's care,

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
you are still too simple.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Stop pretending!

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,880
Me?

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
The words on the plate

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
are drawn with lard

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,040
and red salt.

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,240
The lard will melt when it is hot,

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
which will cause the plate to bleed.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Lu Yi Jing,

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
you actually came up with such a stupid idea

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
to frame me

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
and make the hall a mess.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
You made the hall like this

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
because you are a monster.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
Can you afford it?

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
Lu Yi Jing.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,640
Father!

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
Bastard!

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
How dare you touch the ancestral spirit?

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,720
How dare you!

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,720
Father, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,720
From now on,

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
you are not allowed to enter the hall again.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
Go back and reflect on your mistakes.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Write a thousand times of scriptures

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
and apologize to the ancestors.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,960
Help me.

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Father!

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Mother!

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
I know my mistake.

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,960
I didn't mean to do it.

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Miss, let's go.

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Chu Niang,

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,040
this is also because of you.

74
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,400
You wiped the ancestral spirit's plate clean

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
and you were filial.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
You have finally recognized your ancestors.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Thank you, father.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Su Yan,

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,320
your sister is back now.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,320
You have to work harder

81
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
to support the Lu family.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,240
Father,

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
since your sister is back,

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
why don't you just push the boat

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
and give the Lu family's goods to her?

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Father.

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
I, Lu Si Yan,

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
will never inherit the family business.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,640
How dare you!

90
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
Turn around.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,400
Kneel.

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Kneel.

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,960
I told you to kneel!

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,320
I want to confess to the ancestors.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,200
How dare you say such a thing?

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,680
I will break your legs!

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,720
Master, have some tea.

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
Thank you.

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,000
Little Jiangzhou,

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,120
it's all my fault for being too spoiled

101
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
and spoiling her.

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
But Chu Ning is smart.

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
She really looks like you.

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
It's because of her smartness

105
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
that I can't keep her.

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,120
Madam,

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
I have a daughter.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760
Master wants a son.

109
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Why do you have a daughter?

110
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Madam,

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,000
I have a son.

112
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
Come on, show me.

113
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Lin Chu Ning is a bomb.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,840
If I don't keep her,

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,560
Master will find out the truth about me.

116
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
I can't let her break my heart.

117
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
She has ruined my family.

118
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
She won't let anyone take my son away.

119
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
Chu Ning is the daughter of the Lu family.

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
I have no choice.

121
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,000
I hope the Lu family can bless Xiaorou

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
and get rid of the bitter sea.

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
What are you hiding?

124
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
Show me.

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Kneel.

126
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,120
Why do you care about me?

127
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,880
What are you doing?

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Lu Si Yan.

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Don't move.

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,720
Give it back to me.

131
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Xiaorou,

132
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,440
she and you are born in the same year, same month, same day.

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Why do you put her birthmark

134
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,440
under my sign?

135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
Give it to me.

136
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,840
Xiaorou is heartless and innocent.

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
Although she is not my sister,

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
she is my sister.

139
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
I wish to share my good luck with her.

140
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,080
I just hope

141
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,520
the ancestors of the Lu family

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,520
can bless her

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,760
and keep her safe.

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
I didn't expect

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
you would believe that.

146
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
That's because you

147
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
have never been forced to be a bachelor.

148
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,880
You don't know what it means to believe in something.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,200
I don't know anything else.

150
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
I just know

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
you are much better

152
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,960
to your sister

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,160
than to your brother.

154
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,320
You are jealous.

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,840
No.

156
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,080
It's rare to see you so good.

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
I have to thank

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
the ancestors

159
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
for my carelessness.

160
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,960
So I have to pay my respects to them.

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,560
So you will listen to your parents

162
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,520
for this matter?

163
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Of course not.

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
I have my own way.

165
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,640
No one can stop me.

166
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,760
But it's right.

167
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
In fact, it's not your duty

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
to inherit the family business.

169
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
I think they are in heaven.

170
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
I hope you can

171
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
fulfill your wish.

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
What do you think?

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,000
Really?

174
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Otherwise...?

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:11:06,440
is happiness evening

176
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,640
灌溉滤经烦到 Jiang Chu Wode Jie Ao

177
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:50,980
Jiang Chu Wode Jie Ao

178
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,240
重圆

179
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,980
别再说爱情是孤独的解药

180
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,660
别再说喧闹是狂欢的挣扎

181
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,820
是你 是我是谁犯的错

182
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
No.

183
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
No.

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
No.

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Don't do this.

186
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
No.

187
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Si Yan.

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
No!

189
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
You...

190
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Why are you here?

191
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
You were in the cold water yesterday.

192
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
You caught a cold.

193
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
You kept talking nonsense.

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
You're hiding from me?

195
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
No.

196
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I... just...

197
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
said...

198
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
said something in my dream.

199
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
You...

200
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I didn't hear what you said.

201
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
But...

202
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
it seems like a nightmare.

203
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
A nightmare?

204
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I did have a nightmare.

205
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
A nightmare.

206
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
A nightmare.

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Hey, Lin Chu Ning.

208
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Although we're in a partnership now,

209
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
but you came in like this.

210
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Isn't it a bit...

211
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
dangerous?

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Although we're in a partnership,

213
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
we're also siblings.

214
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
You care about your brother. Of course.

215
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Thank you for your concern.

216
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Master.

217
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
It's been very dry lately.

218
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Drink some lotus seed porridge.

219
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
It'll lighten your fever.

220
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
You...

221
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
taught your son well.

222
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
You're better than drinking a hundred thousand porridge.

223
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Where's that bastard?

224
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
The bastard is here.

225
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
From today on,

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
you should go to work at the Lu's.

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Chu Ning will supervise you.

228
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Dad.

229
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
With such a capable daughter,

230
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
isn't that enough? Why do you have to keep an eye on me?

231
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Can a daughter be like a son?

232
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

233
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
You're dreaming about flying all day long.

234
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
What's the point of that?

235
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I think you're just letting your father's sons

236
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
gather together in a fair way.

237
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
You're just waiting to die.

238
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
What do you mean?

239
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
We're attacking them.

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
When the enemy's planes fly into our territory,

241
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
all the roads and bridges will be blown up.

242
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
It'll be too late then.

243
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
You...

244
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Siyan, don't disobey your father.

245
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Chu Ning.

246
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
What's wrong?

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I...

248
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
This...

249
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Is this egg fried with peanut oil?

250
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
I'm allergic to peanuts.

251
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't like them.

252
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
I don't like them.

253
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I don't like them.

254
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't like them.

255
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I don't like them.

256
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm allergic to peanuts?

257
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Father, look.

258
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
This is your daughter.

259
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
She's the same as you.

260
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
We're not the same.

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Don't expect me.

262
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
I only know your father is allergic to peanuts.

263
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
So I made one for him.

264
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
It seems

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I have to make one for you.

266
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I think

267
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Chu Ning is more like me.

268
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Here, eat.

269
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
You're not like me at all.

270
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Are you going to see Boss Gao?

271
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
He used Xiaorou as a bargaining chip.

272
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
He won't hurt me

273
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
before he gets what he wants.

274
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
You're over-reacting.

275
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Who's worried about you?

276
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Really?

277
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Fine.

278
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I'm over-reacting.

279
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll go with you.

280
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
No need.

281
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm not worried about you.

282
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
I'm doing this for Xiaorou.

283
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
If I had more experience

284
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
and helped you bring her out,

285
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
things wouldn't have happened.

286
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
If your family didn't abandon Xiaorou,

287
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
none of this would have happened.

288
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
The priority

289
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
was to save Xiaorou from the devil's lair.

290
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
As for those who owe Xiaorou,

291
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
your family owes Xiaorou.

292
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Then let her settle it with you.

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Our family owes her?

294
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
What do we owe her?

295
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
She gave Xiaorou a package of goods.

296
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Why is she so angry with Lu Jia?

297
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Congratulations, my dear niece.

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
You've become a family member

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
who's completely and completely honest.

300
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Don't make a fool of me.

301
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Where's Xiaorou?

302
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
You really dare to come to the mansion alone.

303
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Aren't you afraid...

304
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Gao Yunfeng,

305
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
I'm telling you.

306
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I helped you get married and get over the border last time.

307
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
It's because of Xiaorou.

308
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
I can let you live

309
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
and I can let you die.

310
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Xiaorou,

311
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Chunniang, Chunniang,

312
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Chunniang, take me away, okay?

313
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Xiaorou, I'm sorry.

314
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
It's all my fault.

315
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I should have found out earlier that you're not dead.

316
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I wouldn't have made you become like this.

317
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Chunniang, I beg you to take me away.

318
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
They hit me, scolded me, and forced me.

319
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I really want to die.

320
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
But I can't even die.

321
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Xiaorou.

322
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Chunniang,

323
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Chunniang.

324
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't be afraid.

325
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Gao Yunfeng, make a condition.

326
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I want the Lu family.

327
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
The shares,

328
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
the land,

329
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
or the shops?

330
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
All of them.

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
I want the whole Lu family.

332
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
All of them.

333
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Gao Yunfeng, don't go too far.

334
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
You know what?

335
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I need money.

336
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I need a lot of money.

337
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
This way I can create a gentle fragrance.

338
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I can create a gentle fragrance

339
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
into the happiest

340
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
in the world.

341
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
No.

342
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Then I will...

343
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Don't touch him.

344
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Don't worry.

345
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I won't let you suffer.

346
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
The whole gentle fragrance

347
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
will be yours.

348
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
I'll give you three times.

349
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Chunniang,

350
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
take me away, okay?

351
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I don't want to stay here anymore.

352
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Chunniang.

353
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Xiaorou, don't be afraid.

354
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
I will take you away.

355
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Okay.

356
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
It's time.

357
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
My niece,

358
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
please.

359
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Gao Yunfeng,

360
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
if you dare to hurt him again,

361
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
you will get nothing.

362
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Please.

363
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Don't wait.

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Chunniang,

365
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Chunniang, you have to save me.

366
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Chunniang.

367
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Do you think

368
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
he will give you

369
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
everything in the Lu family?

370
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
You know

371
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
your good friend.

372
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
She is always the smartest.

373
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
She is the most smart.

374
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
She entered the Lu family

375
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
just for the Lu family's property.

376
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
She could have had money.

377
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Why would she miss it?

378
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Saving you is just a matter of time.

379
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Really?

380
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
What?

381
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
You are in such a hurry

382
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
to leave me now?

383
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
How could it be?

384
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I will always be yours.

385
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Then today,

386
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
let's play

387
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
something different.

388
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Chunniang,

389
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
you became the daughter of the Lu family.

390
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
You made me

391
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
a lonely person.

392
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Let's play together.

393
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Okay.

394
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
The sea is still

395
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
in your heart.

396
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
The flowers are still in the heart.

397
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
We met

398
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
countless times.

399
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
It's hard to stop.

400
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
I leave a strong

401
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
pain to myself.

402
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I

403
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
don't care about you.

404
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
If the sea

405
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
is still in your heart,

406
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
it's hard to stop.

407
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm alone

408
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
in the sea.

409
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm alone

410
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
in the sea.

411
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm alone

412
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
in the sea.

413
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm alone

414
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
in the sea.

415
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm alone

416
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
in the sea.

417
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm alone

418
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
in the sea.

419
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,440
onder twists

420
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,440
el hillo

421
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
lives

422
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
i had

423
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
a

424
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
fight

425
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
against

426
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,840
the

427
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
world

428
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
that

429
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I am the only one who has ever left a piece of me

430
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,440
If love is like a dream, like a storm

431
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,440
In the dream, we are only one

432
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,440
I am willing to be in your arms forever

433
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
The evening breeze outside the sea

434
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Is accompanying me to think of you

435
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,440
I am willing to turn into a love that is like the ocean

436
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
If love is like a storm, like a storm

437
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Can the sky be stopped

438
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,440
The wind is blowing away my memories

439
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Thank you for watching!
