1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Handsome

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,020
Handsome

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,620
Handsome

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,780
Handsome

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,220
Handsome

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,000
No-??

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,380
No-??

8
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,900
One day after the visit

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,080
tone

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,480
ton

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,380
ton

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,720
ton

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,800
ton

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,080
ton

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,880
Until that day, I saw the owner of the house

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,080
with a pendant that looked like this.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,880
I asked many shops.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
They said this jade was unique.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
It should be a pair.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,080
So, this is how they were willing to marry.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Si Yan, where is your pendant?

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,080
This is my daughter's pendant.

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,080
You are really my daughter.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Master, actually, I was carrying a dragon phoenix pendant.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,880
But my daughter died when she was born.

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,080
I was afraid you would be sad, so I had my aunt bury her.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,680
I have been very nice to Jing these years.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,080
It's because I can't let go of my daughter.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
I didn't expect that you are still alive.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
Mother.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,080
Chunni, sorry for you.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,280
Then, take a good day and let you take your daughter.

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,880
Thank you, father.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,280
Mother abandoned me so easily.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Now, I can't even recognize her.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,880
Si Yan, I didn't abandon your sister.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,680
She is not my sister. She is just a pendant.

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Who knows how she got it?

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,280
You brat, she is your sister.

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,480
If you don't want our Lu family to be a joke,

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,480
then put away your messy ideas.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Chunni, my poor child.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
Mother, as long as I can recognize you and father,

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
everything is worth it.

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,880
Miss, the room is ready.

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
You should rest early.

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
The world is unfair.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,880
How could you call Lu Si Yan such a scumbag?

49
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
You want to get into the mansion.

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
You are a traitor.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
You are a traitor.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,480
Get into the mansion?

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Xiaorou, I will help you get back what belongs to you.

54
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
Is this how you get into the Lu family?

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Lu Si Yan, I am your sister.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Sister? What sister?

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,080
Which sister would do this to her brother?

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Which sister would do this to her brother?

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,880
I think there is a misunderstanding between us.

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Misunderstanding?

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,280
You have feelings for me

62
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,480
or do you have other thoughts?

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Does it make sense now?

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Of course it does.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,280
This is the decision.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
After you are exposed,

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,680
should I kill you or let you die?

68
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
investigation

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Do you want to take a rest?

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Chuning...

71
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Do you think if my father knew that you were trying to set me up,

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
he would still accept you as his daughter?

73
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Save me.

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Wen Ning, have you had enough?

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Be careful with your smart grandmother and your smart grandfather.

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Sister.

77
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Wen Ning.

78
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Father.

79
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,080
It's late at night. Why are you in your sister's room?

80
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Sister asked me to clean her room.

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Chuning, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
I asked her.

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
I didn't expect my daughter to be the sales assistant of the Lu's department store.

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
So I decided to appoint you as the sales assistant.

85
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
It's a compensation for you.

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Thank you, father.

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
You brat, go back to sleep.

88
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Congratulations.

89
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Young Master, what are you going to do?

90
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
My parents are easily deceived by others.

91
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm not that easy to deceive.

92
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Make sure you investigate her identity.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Don't let anyone see her.

94
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Yes.

95
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I heard that your colleagues often bully her.

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
How about I warn them?

97
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
How can a young lady in the Lu's department store be so incompetent?

98
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Besides, do you really think they can bully her?

99
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
The Lu's department store

100
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Didn't you tease our young master and director Shen?

101
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,080
You are jealous of your sister.

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
If you don't be a good daughter-in-law,

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
why do you come to steal food from us?

104
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Don't you think it's like the cloth in my hand?

105
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
You should throw it away after they use it.

106
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Lin Su Nian.

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
What's wrong with you?

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
You shameless girl.

109
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I'll kill you.

110
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Don't be rude.

111
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
This is the young lady of our Lu's department store.

112
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,080
She is also the most noble person in the Lu's department store.

113
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
I'm sorry, young lady.

114
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
It's okay.

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
But if I were you...

116
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
I would choose to resign.

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
After all, I am very ambitious.

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,080
In the future, you should remember to be a good person.

119
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
In case you will be beaten by others in the future.

120
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
From now on,

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Lu's department store can't have such a bad blood.

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
If someone bullies the employee,

123
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
I will punish him severely.

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes, young lady.

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Lu's department store

126
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
You are the last one in the shop.

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,080
You are so shameless.

128
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
You are the first one in the shop.

129
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I can't take your title.

130
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I'll take you to a place.

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Are you afraid?

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Let's go.

133
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Wait.

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Take it.

135
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Why do I feel like I'm floating?

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Are you afraid?

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
How is it?

138
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Is it beautiful?

139
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
We are on the hot air balloon.

140
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
It's a beautiful sunset.

141
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Such a beautiful place.

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
It's time to tell the truth.

143
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
You are so good at lying.

144
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
You should appreciate the beautiful scenery.

145
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
You should appreciate it.

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Such a beautiful scenery.

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
You should see it more.

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,080
After all, it's the last time you can't see it.

149
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
You want to kill me?

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
This is a thousand-meter high pit.

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
It's the best place to throw the corpse.

152
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Let's play a game.

153
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Let's see how lucky you are.

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
If you are lucky,

155
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I can only say that you still have a chance.

156
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,080
What is your real purpose of getting into the Lu family?

157
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Say it.

158
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
What do you want me to say?

159
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Five.

160
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Four.

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I am the daughter of the Lu family.

162
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
I just want to be a member of the family.

163
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Three.

164
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
What I said is true.

165
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
What do you want me to say?

166
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
You still have one last chance.

167
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Say it.

168
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I can only take one shot.

169
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I just want to know why my parents don't want me.

170
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Why they let me suffer and don't dare to take me back.

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
I just want to live.

172
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't take it back.

173
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
No bullets.

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Are you crazy?

175
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
If I find you lie to me,

176
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I will be crazier than now.

177
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
This one.

178
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
For you.

179
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Keep it well.

180
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Lu Si Yan.

181
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
You will be crazy soon.

182
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Your sister is crazier than you.

183
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Lin Chu Ning.

184
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I want to see what else you can say.

185
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Mo Chen.

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Why are you here?

187
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
I am here to bring you breakfast.

188
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Do you want to try?

189
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Thank you.

190
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Why did you become the daughter of the Lu family?

191
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
It doesn't affect our plan.

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Lu Si Yan broke the marriage.

193
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Master Lu is very angry.

194
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
We can make a big deal of it.

195
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
We can cheat him to borrow the loan.

196
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Since you have already returned to your ancestors,

197
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Lu Si Yan will not be able to help you.

198
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Since you have already returned to your ancestors,

199
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Lu Si Yan is your biological brother.

200
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you really want to kill him?

201
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Although Xiaorou is the same as her,

202
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
she is always a little bit different.

203
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
She has been very hardworking since she was a child.

204
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
It's time to let her suffer.

205
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Lu Si Yan.

206
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
The first gift is coming.

207
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Flying is a dangerous and dangerous sport.

208
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
It is like your self-defeating spirit.

209
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
You are flying in the sky.

210
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,600
You are not only a political

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I am lucky to become a pilot.

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Now the mountain is full of wood under the fire.

213
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Wei Yuan, use my wings to support you.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I am leaving first.

215
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Okay.

216
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Young Master,

217
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
now that Miss Lin has become your sister,

218
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
the previous method must not work.

219
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
What are you going to do later?

220
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Since Uncle Lin cried and shouted to go home,

221
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
let him take over the big stall.

222
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I am responsible for being a loser.

223
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
My father can't just watch me

224
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
and lose all his money.

225
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I feel that you actually don't hate Miss Lin.

226
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Instead, you are willing to recognize her.

227
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
You actually like her, right?

228
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
I am not a bad person.

229
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I am a good person.

230
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
You are good at it.

231
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I have a plan.

232
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Lu Si Yan is not allowed to be a pilot.

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Give me back my money.

234
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Give me back my money.

235
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Give me back my money.

236
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Give me back my money.

237
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Give me back my money.

238
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Give me back my money.

239
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Don't touch me.

240
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
I don't care who it is.

241
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
You must give me back my money.

242
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Otherwise, I will jump into the water.

243
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Don't be excited.

244
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Tell me what you want to say.

245
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Tell me what you want to say.

246
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
You!

247
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't come over.

248
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
If you come over, I will jump into the water.

249
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Why don't you jump?

250
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
The young master owes me money.

251
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
I have to pay for it.

252
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
What do you mean by owe?

253
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
This is a money transfer.

254
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
You will pay it back.

255
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Is it necessary?

256
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
The bigger the problem,

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
the better.

258
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Don't worry.

259
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
I don't want any of your money.

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
I won't lose my job.

261
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Okay.

262
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Lin Chuning.

263
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I want to see

264
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
if the old man finds out that you hired me to borrow the tape.

265
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Will you stay in Lu's room?

266
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
You

267
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
just wait to be kicked out of the house with me.

268
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
You are wrong.

269
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Aren't you going to jump?

270
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Jump.

271
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Jump.

272
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Jump.

273
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You are afraid.

274
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
You are afraid of the jump.

275
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
You are afraid of death.

276
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Do you want me to help you?

277
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Young master.

278
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
What are you doing?

279
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I am helping him.

280
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Life is very hard.

281
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
If you can get a good baby on the road in your next life,

282
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
it will be good.

283
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Don't waste my time.

284
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I will help you.

285
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I don't want to jump.

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I don't want to jump.

287
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
It seems that using the tape

288
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
will not break Lu Siying.

289
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
I can only

290
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
beat him with my body.

291
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I can only kick him out of the Lu family.

292
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Enough.

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Do you

294
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
like to control the fate of others?

295
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Yes.

296
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I like it. What's wrong?

297
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Why are you the one who did the wrong thing?

298
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
We are the ones who should die.

299
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
I want to be good.

300
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I want to step on you.

301
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I want

302
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
to make this world

303
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
not sorry.

304
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
You are over-confident.

305
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Lu Siying.

306
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Don't you like

307
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
to push others into the abyss?

308
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
What do you want to do?

309
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I want to be a good boy.

310
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I want to be a good girl.

311
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I want to be a good boy.

312
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
You...

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
You lost.

314
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Why did your sister fall down?

315
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Fortunately, there is an electric pole below.

316
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
She hurt her hand.

317
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
If your sister weren't there,

318
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
you would have lost all the reputation of the Lu family.

319
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Don't think I don't know what you are thinking.

320
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
You died

321
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
and I only live one day.

322
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
I won't let you go to that stupid school.

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
School?

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
He wants to join the army?

325
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Dad, don't be angry.

326
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
It's my fault.

327
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
I didn't teach my brother well.

328
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
That's why he became like this.

329
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
You only know how long it has been.

330
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
My mother is too tolerant of him.

331
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Don't go back to the Lu family for now.

332
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Chuning,

333
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
you stay in the general manager position for now.

334
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Dad, this is not appropriate.

335
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
It's not inappropriate.

336
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Anyway, he has been in the rain for three days and sunbathe for two days.

337
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
When he is jealous,

338
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
return him.

339
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
The bamboo basket is empty.

340
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
You

341
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
still dare to be angry here?

342
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
You go back to the room

343
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
and reflect on yourself.

344
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Without my permission,

345
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
I won't let you leave the room.

346
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Get out.

347
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
This is not enough.

348
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Lu Si Yan,

349
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
the second gift

350
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
is packed.

351
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
This bean cake is delicious.

352
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I couldn't bear to buy it before.

353
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Try it.

354
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
It's so good.

355
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
But how do I know

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
if you are hurting me?

357
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
You are slapping me.

358
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
You want to give me a candy, right?

359
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Of course I want

360
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
to poison you.

361
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
It's your turn.

362
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
You are serious.

363
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I always think

364
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
that compared to family property,

365
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
what you want is my life.

366
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
I have a sister.

367
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
We grew up together in the Yuying Hall.

368
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Although we are not a family,

369
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
we are a family.

370
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
All the hardest days

371
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
were spent with her.

372
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
It's so beautiful.

373
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Xiaorou, we are

374
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
