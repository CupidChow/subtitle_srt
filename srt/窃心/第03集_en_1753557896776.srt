1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Chu Ming.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Chu Ming.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Kill him.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He has endless wealth and family's favor.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He has endless wealth and family's favor.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But even so,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
he still dares to see his own son.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He shouldn't die.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to torture him slowly.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to make him lose his reputation.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to make him suffer a lot.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Chu Ming.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Kong Xing.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You have a family of six.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You hate Mu Ziyin.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I don't want you to be hurt a little bit.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now the most important thing

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is to protect us.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mo Chen.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you two doing?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh no. Miss. Miss.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Something happened to Young Master.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Young Master Lu is poisoned.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it serious? Will it be dangerous?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Fortunately, it was discovered early.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If it's too late, it's hard to say.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
According to this prescription,

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
take it to Young Master Lu.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In less than three days, the poison in his body will be cleared.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How could he be poisoned?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tell them to investigate.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Even if Lu's family is destroyed,

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we have to find the murderer.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Kneel down.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm so worried about you.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But you took the opportunity to kill my son.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm so blind.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How could I hurt my brother?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's because he's your brother that you hurt him.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So the Lu family is yours.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You even killed your own brother.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're so cruel.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't poison him.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How dare you talk back?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He was poisoned because he ate your bean cake.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The maid saw you coming out of the room at night.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's not you.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom, don't talk to him.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Search him.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You shouldn't be angry with Shen Mo Chen.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Shen Mo Chen?

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mom, look.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You bitch.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mom, not only that,

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you also provoked the servants to make trouble.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You even lost your right to inherit.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I shouldn't have admitted to you.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If I really wanted to hurt him,

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
how could I have given him the cake I gave him?

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This kind of thing is stupid.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Someone is obviously framed.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, you don't admit it.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Beat him until he admits it.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Beat him until he admits it.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Stop.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Deputy Chief.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't come over.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're really cruel.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It hurts.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the medicine to cure the fever.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Drink it.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You poisoned him, didn't you?

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is it that obvious?

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're a young master.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're really cruel to yourself

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to drive me out of Lu Mansion.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If so, why did you come to save me?

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I just want you to know

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that you can't be so happy in this Lu family.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want you to live, and you can live.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want you to die,

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so you have to die.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Drink it.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Take this money and go to the South Pole and the Dog Cave.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Get out of the Lu family and don't come back.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Even if I die, I have to die in the Lu family.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It seems that it doesn't hurt enough.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why don't we make a bet?

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What?

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If I can get out of this woodshed in an hour,

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you can let me be your sister.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
See you in an hour.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The fire is on!

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The fire is on!

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hurry!

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Crazy!

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you crazy?

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He should have set the fire.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come with me.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't touch me.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's time.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You want to act, don't you?

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You haven't had enough, have you?

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come, I'll accompany you.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The fire is on.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Siyan!

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mom, don't go.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry up!

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you doing?

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you doing?

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I haven't taken my money yet.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let go of me.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you crazy?

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Siyan!

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Someone is coming out.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Siyan!

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you okay?

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry, mom.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's all because of me.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I didn't expect that

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
they wanted to frame me.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They wanted to kill me.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Mom,

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I almost killed Siyan.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It doesn't matter if I die.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But I can't let Siyan get involved

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and let mom misunderstand me.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's okay if he's okay.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go to your room and rest.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're so good at it.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're good at lying.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're good at everything.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're amazing.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Brother,

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you lost.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You lost.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My money is burned out.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You have to pay me.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're so rich.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Not everyone is like you.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're born with gold key.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll give you all.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sister Zhen.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it embarrassing?

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You asked me to leave Lu's mansion

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and send you flowers.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Master, I found it.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Lin Chunni,

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you have to leave now.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm leaving.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I found this safe

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in your Yuying Hall.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
My mom suspected

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
my sister was not dead.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She was in Yuying Hall.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So,

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dean Lin,

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
please recall.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Have you seen it?

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Miss,

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Master told me,

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
as long as you're born,

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
both you and Dean Lin will be shot.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This pendant.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So good.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Xiaorou,

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
did you make it?

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Xiaorou.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't cry.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, put it on.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I remember.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This pendant

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
seems to be from Chunning.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you sure

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it's from Chunning?

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, this pendant is unique.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I won't remember it wrong.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So this is why you want to take my pendant.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Chunning, I thought I wouldn't see you today.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I know you're here.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I came back in advance.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you satisfied now?

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Master, I'm just in case.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't blame him.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Brother,

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
can you give me

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the pendant back?

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Dad,

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
mom, since Si Yan

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
doesn't want to recognize me,

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll move out of the Lu family and live in the Yuying Hall.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why are you still standing there?

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Apologize to your sister.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you hear me?

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Forget it, dad.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't think Si Yan

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
did it on purpose.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't make it hard for him.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You called me here.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's the matter?

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Master, Lu Si Yan will find out soon.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Can you help me make a lie

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
that this pendant is mine?

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Master, don't you blame me?

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This pendant was originally from Xiaorou.

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I took it

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and took its identity.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know you.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know your personality.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Otherwise,

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I wouldn't have entrusted the Yuying Hall to you.

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I believe you

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
must have your own reasons.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Thank you.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Director, thank you so much.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Silly girl.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You took good care of the Yuying Hall.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was right.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The little girl is grown up.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She's a good director.

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't worry.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The Yuying Hall is my home.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
As long as I have a bite,

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will never starve my sisters.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Remember, the Yuying Hall

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
will always be your home.

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll go now.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Xiaoliu.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Xiaoliu.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Send me back to the Yuying Hall.

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, Miss.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sit in front.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You haven't apologized to me yet.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Say it again.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry, Miss.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Good girl.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Your sister

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
has been killed by you.

265
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No matter how many times you say sorry,

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you can't make up for your sin.

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I called your sister

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
to take you home

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
because I was willing to admit defeat.

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I didn't do it willingly.

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Lu Siyan.

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You don't want to admit

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that I'm your sister

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because you feel guilty.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I feel guilty?

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The rich young master Lu

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
has many women.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He has ruined many women.

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you still not know what I'm talking about?

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Lin Chu Ning.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What do you want?

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Lu Siyan.

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
haven't done anything

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
else to me?

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't go too far.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Go too far?

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're actually very young.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You have so much love.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You've done so many things

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that you can't even imagine.

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's none of your business.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Lu Siyan.

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're asking yourself

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and you don't want to answer.

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Since you like

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to pursue your own interests,

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
why don't we just go all out?

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not as mean as you think.

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Please,

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
sister,

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
do as you please.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Really?

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Coward.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Drive.

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I saw you

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
in the car.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Your sacrifice

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
was too much.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't bear to leave my child

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and go to the bathroom.

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
How come?

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Since the moment you picked me up,

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
no matter what you do,

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll always stand behind you.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Get up.

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We're going to the bathroom.

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll be right behind you.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're girls

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
who are abandoned by our parents.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We don't take boys in.

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You'd better not stay here.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I saved you.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll take care of you.

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've arranged a house for you.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You can live there.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll visit you often.

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How's the progress

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of your investigation?

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I found that Lu Siyan

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
often stayed in Xianli City.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There's a different situation there.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't see anyone.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But I'll find out the secret.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll make Lu Siyan famous.

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Chuning,

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
leave it to me.

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't act rashly.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Lu Siyan.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
My sister.

343
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
My sister.

344
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
When you go to the underworld,

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll see if you dare to recognize your sister.

346
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Lu Dasheng,

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
why are you drinking alone?

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You have a sister.

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't you miss her?

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Compared with her,

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
do you deserve her?

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You...

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're drunk.

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Give me that bottle of wine.

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Young Master Lu, you're drunk.

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll help you go back.

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want more.

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not drunk.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I heard from Young Master Lu

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
that there's a good place for you.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Take me there.

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hua Ming, Yue An, Rong Qingwu.

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Ziyue, Sishi.

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wenrou, Xiangli.

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Du Chunxiang.

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Come in.

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm alone.

368
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't want to go.

369
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm afraid I can't go all out.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't act rashly.

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have to think of other ways.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Did Xiaorou get trapped here

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
before she died?

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
As long as it exists,

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
there will be a trace.

376
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Ziyan.

377
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why are the cheongsam so familiar?

378
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Aren't these the clothes I gave Xiaorou?

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's a trace of Xiaorou's life here.

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
A baby bottle.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ziyan, I'm pregnant with your baby.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Pan Qi.

383
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Xiaorou.

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
How could there be Xiaorou's stuff here?

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Could it be Xiaorou...

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No, it can't be.

387
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Xiaorou died in my arms that day.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Thanks to your protection,

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I can make a bigger one

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
with my gentle fragrance.

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
We don't talk about two families.

392
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The Yuying Hall

393
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
is a cook

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
after a few years.

395
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll bring you the best

396
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
in a few days.

397
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Lu Siyan is not in the wine cellar.

398
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Is there anything

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that can't be seen in the wine cellar?

400
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is...

401
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yilan Flower?

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Using Yilan Flower to make a love story.

403
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You bastard.

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll send you back.

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Boss told me to go and see you

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
when the new one arrives.

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Lu Siyan?

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Li Zhu Niang.

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you crazy?

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you know where that is?

411
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Of course I know.

412
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's where men live.

413
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's where women live.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let go.

415
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Since you know

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that's where women live,

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
you should stay away from her.

418
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you know?

419
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Lu Siyan, what do you want?

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't ever let me see

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Li Zhu Niang again.

422
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you remember?

423
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Zhu Niang,

424
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I heard you say that Lu Siyan

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
not only created the scent of gentle fragrance,

426
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
but also the girl.

427
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm not sure if the scent of gentle fragrance

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
is related to Lu Siyan.

429
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But it must be related to her death.

430
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What did you say?

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Xiaorou is dead?

432
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But you told me before

433
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that she went back to her hometown to find her family.

434
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I was afraid you would say something bad

435
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
in the Yuying Hall.

436
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was afraid you would say something bad in the Yuying Hall.

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So I didn't dare to tell you the truth.

438
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Lu Siyan has always been a man of his word.

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But I don't think

440
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
he would do something like this.

441
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No matter what, Mo Chen,

442
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
please save those sisters.

443
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Then I have to kill Lu Siyan.

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
First, you can avenge Xiaorou.

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Second, you can follow the rules

446
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and inherit the Lu family.

447
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Who?

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I only want to get close to you

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and touch your hands.

450
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We are like flowers in the heart.

451
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We have met countless times.

452
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But we can't get close.

453
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I have to leave a strong scar to myself.

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't care about you.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If the sea can cut your back,

456
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the sky will be my coat of arms.

457
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If the dream can be my coat of arms,

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
will the sky be my coat of arms?

459
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If love can be like a dream,

460
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and dream can be like a coat of arms,

461
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

462
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

463
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

464
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
When I'm at the bottom of the sea,

466
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm like a fallen leaf.

467
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm like a fallen leaf.

468
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I have to leave a strong scar to myself.

469
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't care about you.

470
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
If the sea can cut your back,

471
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
the sky will be my coat of arms.

472
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Will the sky be my coat of arms?

473
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Will the sky be my coat of arms?

474
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If love can be like a dream,

475
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and dream can be like a coat of arms,

476
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

477
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

478
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.

479
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
If love can be like a dream,

480
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and dream can be like a coat of arms,

481
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the wind will be my coat of arms.

482
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I would like to be in your arms forever.
