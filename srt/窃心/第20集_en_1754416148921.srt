Episode 19

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:50,940
No way

4
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,140
don't shoot with her idea

5
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,660
She did it on purpose for the beautys

6
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,220
Let me steal a cat for you

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,060
No.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,980
The cat is very sticky.

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,980
It can stay with you.

10
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Sleep well.

11
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,620
Take your medicine.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,460
Your wound will heal faster.

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,380
Can I touch it?

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,540
Sure.

15
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Touch it.

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
You said it yourself.

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,900
Lin Chu Ning.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,340
What did you call me?

19
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,860
Lu Chu Ning.

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,860
I remember that Luo called you before.

21
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,740
What's wrong?

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,100
Your wound is hurting again, right?

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,740
What are you doing?

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,060
It used to be like this.

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,340
You were never like this before.

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,500
I wasn't like this before.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,820
I'm not like this now.

28
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
Don't challenge my patience.

29
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,940
I was not very domineering just now.

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,620
What's wrong?

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,260
You are a cat.

32
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,860
You don't like it?

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,420
No.

34
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,660
Right.

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,380
I'm not a cat.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,580
creamy

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
From genocide

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
From убий

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,060
Nietzsche

40
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,780
With you

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
weOk

42
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,180
look around

43
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,460
In the monsoon

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,060
looking for

45
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,780
Okay.

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,500
Let's eat.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,140
You cooked this?

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,780
Yeah.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,300
I cooked it especially for you.

50
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
So good.

51
00:03:51,540 --> 00:04:01,540
I know you locked me up here because you were afraid I would go out and get in trouble.

52
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,540
But you said that we should fight side by side.

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:14,540
No matter what the difficulties are, even if it's up the mountain or down the sea, I want to be with you.

54
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,540
I know.

55
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Oh, right. What's in the boxes that Boss Gao is holding?

56
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
It's a girl.

57
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,540
A girl?

58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Zi Yan, look.

59
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,540
The men and women here are so happy.

60
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,540
I gave them happiness.

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,540
When the new Weiru box is built, it will only be more soul-saving than the old one.

62
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Gao Yun Feng!

63
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Lu Chun Ning? Why are you still alive?

64
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,540
Are you surprised? You haven't died yet. How could I die?

65
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
Impossible.

66
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
I trusted you so much.

68
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I didn't expect you to think you're Lu, right?

69
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Dad, I just did what I should do. I didn't think of anything else.

70
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,540
Gao Yun Feng, you're a man of your word.

71
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,540
You're trying to save the women.

72
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,540
You said you'd sell them to Wen Rou Xiang when they grew up.

73
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,540
You still don't know how to change your mind.

74
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,540
You still want to sell girls. Do you have any shame?

75
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
You're lying!

76
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,540
I did make a mistake. But all men make mistakes.

77
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I just went to Wen Rou Xiang to find happiness.

78
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,540
But I'm not the boss of Wen Rou Xiang.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,540
You won't give up until you reach the Yellow River?

80
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Okay, I'll make you die today.

81
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Si Yan, Si Yan, don't...

82
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Where is he? Why is he dead?

83
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Did you find anything?

84
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Lin Chu Ning, everyone knows that I'm a thief.

85
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Chu Ning, if you like it, just tell me.

86
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,540
I'll give you one.

87
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Gao Yun Feng, you're a sinner. Don't think you can escape.

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,540
You know I'm a sinner.

89
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
Evidence?

90
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Okay, you want evidence?

91
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,540
I'm the evidence. I, Lu Chu Ning,

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
reported Gao Yun Feng for rape.

93
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
I tried to get into Wen Rou Xiang.

94
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,540
But who would believe what you said?

95
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,540
What you said now is just an excuse to get rid of Lu's family.

96
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
You drove me out of the Lu family first.

97
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
And now you're making me a lot of trouble.

98
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,540
You want to kill me.

99
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Lu Chu Ning, let me tell you.

100
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,540
Even if I'm the owner of Wen Rou Xiang,

101
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
who can prove it?

102
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
I can prove it.

103
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I can prove that he's the owner of Wen Rou Xiang.

104
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,540
I can prove it.

105
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,540
We can all prove it.

106
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
Dad, I can prove it too.

107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
You're the owner.

108
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
You can't escape this time.

109
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,540
You're a blind wolf.

110
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Run? Why should I run?

111
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,540
There are no outsiders here.

112
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
I admit it.

113
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm the owner of Wen Rou Xiang.

114
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm the owner of Wen Rou Xiang.

115
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
What can you do to me?

116
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,540
A man and a woman are two different things.

117
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
I made Wen Rou Xiang.

118
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,540
It's heaven in the world.

119
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
It's them.

120
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,540
They don't know how to enjoy it.

121
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,540
They have to kill themselves.

122
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,540
I made heaven for them.

123
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,540
But they want to send me to hell.

124
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Who's guilty?

125
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Journalists, did you hear it clearly?

126
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
You... How did you get in?

127
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Get out of here.

128
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
It's you.

129
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,540
You're welcome.

130
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
You're a traitor.

131
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,540
Gao Yun Feng, I know you're in the police station.

132
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,540
I can think of a way to get you out of here.

133
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Boss Gao.

134
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Chief Shen.

135
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Go to the court.

136
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Mr. Lin Chun Ning, Lu Si Yan's head is out of the machine.

137
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
You may have a chance.

138
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
Let's go.

139
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
What's going on?

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't move.

141
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Put the gun down.

142
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Lin Chun Ning, you made me do everything.

143
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm going to kill you today.

144
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
And you, you traitor.

145
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,540
I'll kill you after I kill him.

146
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Go to hell.

147
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
Put it down.

148
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Journalists.

149
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Journalists.

150
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Boss Gao is guilty of not being allowed to live.

151
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
As the chief of the police station,

152
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
I have the duty to protect every one of my employees.

153
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Boss Gao is guilty of many crimes.

154
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
He should be held responsible.

155
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
So I'll kill him.

156
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Thank you, everyone.

157
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,540
It seems that Shen Mo Chen is the one who protected Wen Rou Xiang.

158
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,540
That's why he was so anxious to kill him.

159
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Gao Yun Feng's death is not a big deal.

160
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,540
But he is your father after all.

161
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Sheng Wen didn't raise him.

162
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,540
In my heart, he is a bad person.

163
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Does the gun still hurt?

164
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
It hurts.

165
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,540
From now on, you are in my heart.

166
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,540
Tell me.

168
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,540
When will you recover your memory?

169
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Actually, I have a lot of things that I can't remember.

170
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
The only thing I can remember is

171
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,540
I love you.

172
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
I love you.

173
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
God bless you.

174
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Stay with me.

175
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Don't go anywhere.

176
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
I don't want you to be rich or rich.

177
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
I don't want you to be successful.

178
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,540
I just want you to be safe and healthy.

179
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Dad, mom.

180
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,540
I'm going back to Hang Xiao Road tomorrow.

181
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,540
The plane accident

182
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,540
is not as mature as our plane and technology.

183
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
If you want to defeat the enemy,

184
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
you have to be like this.

185
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
You don't have to be afraid of sacrifice and death.

186
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Dad, mom.

187
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I hope you can support me.

188
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
No, Deputy Chief.

189
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
I think it's too dangerous.

190
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,540
Master, say something.

191
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,540
I used to think that he was not righteous.

192
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Now I know

193
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,540
they are doing something great.

194
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Protect the four sides and keep the glory.

195
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
I support you.

196
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Thank you, dad.

197
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
You always say

198
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
you are worried that I will have an accident again.

199
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Don't say that again.

200
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,540
Rather than let you break your wings,

201
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,540
I would rather give you a long life.

202
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Actually, I envy you.

203
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
You have your ambitions.

204
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,540
I didn't know what I wanted before.

205
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
But now I have it.

206
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,540
I hope I can do my best

207
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,540
to provide for women.

208
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,540
I hope one day in this world,

209
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
there will be no more Yu Ying Tang.

210
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
Yes.

211
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Because you are the best.

212
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,540
Lin Chu Min.

213
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Let's go.

214
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,540
Let's go.

215
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
I cooked all the dishes tonight.

216
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Can you eat?

217
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Not necessarily to your taste.

218
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
I am not hungry.

219
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
Dad, mom.

220
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
I have no appetite.

221
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
You can eat.

222
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
I have no appetite either.

223
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Mom, dad, you can eat.

224
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Although Su Yan is not dead,

225
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
I feel that

226
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,540
we are getting worse.

227
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
What are you thinking?

228
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
I am thinking

229
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
when to confess to my dad.

230
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
If it goes on like this,

231
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
when will it end?

232
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
When will you confess?

233
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Aren't you afraid

234
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
if you confess,

235
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,540
dad will kick you out of Lu's Mansion?

236
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
What can I do?

237
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,540
I have no family to go back to.

238
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Just support me.

239
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Is it very expensive to support you?

240
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
I will think about it.

241
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
It's not expensive.

242
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
It's easy to live.

243
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Really?

244
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Yes.

245
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Mom.

246
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I know I am sorry to you.

247
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,540
I have to hide from you.

248
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
But please give me some more time.

249
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I will confess to my dad.

250
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
I understand, mom.

251
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Su Yan,

252
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,540
are you still willing to recognize me as a bird?

253
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
You will always be my bird.

254
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
Chuning.

255
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Mrs. Lu.

256
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
I am sorry.

257
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Congratulations, Director Shen.

258
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
You have become a hero

259
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,540
who has done justice and has done good.

260
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
You can tell me.

261
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
What do you want from me?

262
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
You want to kill Lu Si Yan for me?

263
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Boss Gao is dead.

264
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Lu Si Yan doesn't want you.

265
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
What do you think

266
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,540
you are doing to me now?

267
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
What are you talking about?

268
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
I am just

269
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,540
trying to kill you.

270
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
You are the one who bought the aircraft

271
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,540
and moved the hands and feet of the mechanical engineer.

272
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
I carried the sachet for you.

273
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
Go on.

274
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
Go on.

275
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Boss Gao's sachet

276
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
is not for this purpose.

277
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
You transferred the sachet in advance

278
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
and put Lin Chuning and Lu Si Yan in trouble.

279
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Poor Boss Gao.

280
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
He became a scapegoat.

281
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
He died for no reason.

282
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
What is this?

283
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
A name tag.

284
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
This is Boss Gao's account book.

285
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
You want to build your own incense.

286
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
You can't do it without it.

287
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
I am lonely and helpless.

288
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I just want to find a support for myself.

289
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Good.

290
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,540
I want Shen Ju Zhan to love me.

291
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
This dress...

292
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Is it pretty?

293
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
I made it especially for you.

294
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,540
I like everything you choose.

295
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
I will take you to a place.

296
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Where?

297
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,540
You will know when you get there.

298
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Okay.

299
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,540
Come on.

300
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Lift your feet.

301
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
Be careful.

302
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Walk with me.

303
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Okay.

304
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
We are here.

305
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Okay.

306
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Okay.

307
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Hold this for me.

308
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Chuning.

309
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,540
I have something to tell you.

310
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,540
I have a lot of feelings for you.

311
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,540
But at that time,

312
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
I didn't know what love was.

313
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I have experienced many ups and downs.

314
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,540
When I found out that I was in love with you,

315
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
you were my sister.

316
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
I thought that there was nothing

317
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,540
worse in this world.

318
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,540
That's why I lied to you.

319
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
My love for you

320
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
should be engraved in my bones.

321
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't

322
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
remember you

323
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
when I lost my memory.

324
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
I love you.

325
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I have experienced so many things.

326
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
I will be brave again today.

327
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Chuning.

328
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,540
Will you

329
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
marry me?

330
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
No.

331
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
I will marry you.

332
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
I will marry you.

333
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
I will marry you.

334
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
I will marry you.

335
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
I will marry you.

336
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I will marry you.

337
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
I will marry you.

338
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
I will marry you.

339
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I will marry you.

340
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,540
I will marry you.

341
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I will marry you.

342
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
I will marry you.

343
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
I will marry you.

344
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I will marry you.

345
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
I

346
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
care about you.

347
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
If the sea

348
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
can cut your back,

349
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
the sky can be your coat of arms.

350
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
If the sky

351
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
can cut your back,

352
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
the sky can be your coat of arms.

353
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,540
If love

354
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
can change the shadow of a dream,

355
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
if love

356
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
can change the shadow of a dream,

357
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
I would like to

358
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
be in your arms forever.

359
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
I would like to

360
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
be in your arms forever.

361
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I would like to

362
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
be in your arms forever.

363
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
I would like to

364
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
be in your arms forever.

365
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
I would like to

366
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,540
be in your arms forever.

367
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
I would like to

368
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
be in your arms forever.

369
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I would like to

370
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,540
be in your arms forever.

371
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I would like to

372
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
be in your arms forever.

373
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
If the sea

374
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
can cut your back,

375
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
the sky can be your coat of arms.

376
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
If the sea

377
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
can cut your back,

378
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
the sky can be your coat of arms.

379
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
If love

380
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,540
can change the shadow of a dream,

381
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
if love

382
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
can change the shadow of a dream,

383
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
I would like to

384
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
be in your arms forever.

385
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
If the sea

386
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,900
The evening breeze outside the sea

387
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,820
is like you with me

388
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,540
I am willing to turn into a flag of the ocean

389
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,260
I love the rain in the evening wind

390
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,540
The sky can't stop

391
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,540
The wind is scattered my traces

392
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,540
I love the rain in the evening wind

393
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,540
The sky can't stop
