1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,680
Absolutely такой

2
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,280
Chunni

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,720
You've been sleeping all day

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Wake up

5
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Chunni

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's okay.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you can't wake up,

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll go find you.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wake up, okay?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Si Yan,

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you haven't eaten or drank for days.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If he knows,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
he'll be heartbroken.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Si Yan,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you're not going to wake up.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're going to be heartbroken.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Si Yan, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was just a superstitious star.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I did all this because I love you, Si Yan.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're a bitch.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How dare you hurt my daughter?

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Si Yan, send her to the police station.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mrs. Lu,

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
are you going to abandon me too?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Are you sure you're going to send me to the police station?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please don't send me to the police station, okay?

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Si Yan.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You tricked Lin Chuning into getting into the car.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Who told you to do that to Mrs. Lu?

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Otherwise, Lin Chuning wouldn't get into the car.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We agreed to cooperate.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you hurt my lover,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you'll be double the reward.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What you have to do is to find Lin Chuning's whereabouts as much as possible.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mo Chen,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you got Lin Chuning,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and I got Lu Si Yan.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then we got the Lu family's assets.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,020
We're the biggest

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020
I've been with Shen Mo Chen and Wei Wei for a long time.

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
With Shen Mo Chen,

55
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,020
I'll come out sooner or later.

56
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Then I'll only hurt Chuning in the family.

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
Chuning,

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
I beg you.

59
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
We've been sisters for so many years.

60
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
You won't abandon me.

61
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Chuning,

62
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
I admit that I was wrong.

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Chuning,

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
you're sister and father.

65
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Please help me and Si Yan.

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Chuning.

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Have you said enough?

68
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
If I don't follow her,

69
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,020
this bitch will definitely get Si Yan out of this.

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Si Yan.

71
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Si Yan.

72
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm not a thief.

73
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
If you touch Lin Chuning again,

74
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
I'll kill you.

75
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Last time,

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
you didn't dare.

77
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
You didn't dare to send me to the police station.

78
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
What will happen to Lin Chuning

79
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
when I come out?

80
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Si Yan,

81
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
it doesn't matter if you don't love me.

82
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
As long as I'm by your side.

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
You're sisters.

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I'm helping you.

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Si Yan.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Si Yan,

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I want to help you.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
As long as you're with me,

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I'll never touch Lin Chuning again.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
As long as I can be with you,

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll be content.

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Si Yan,

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Si Yan,

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
you can't be together.

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Chuning.

96
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Mo Chen.

97
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Don't worry.

98
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
I'm not here to take you away.

99
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,060
I heard it from Xiaorou.

100
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
You must be in pain now.

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,060
When did you get so close to Xiaorou?

102
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,060
I love her too.

103
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
We're in the same boat.

104
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Chuning,

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
the best way to forget a relationship

106
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
is to start a new relationship and marry me.

107
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
But I don't love you.

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
You can slowly develop a relationship.

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Mo Chen,

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
I always thought that

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
relationship is not important.

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Until I met Si Yan,

114
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
I found out

115
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,100
that relationship is the purest thing in the world

116
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
and the least likely to be a part of more magazines.

117
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
It doesn't matter.

118
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I care about your interests.

119
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Thank you,

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Chuning.

121
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
We'll meet again.

122
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm leaving.

123
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Okay.

124
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Chuning,

125
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Si Yan has accepted me.

126
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Impossible.

127
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Don't try to make a scene.

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Si Yan said

129
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
you're his sister.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
It's impossible for you two.

131
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Chuning,

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I want to help you.

133
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
I don't want to see you two in pain.

134
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
So,

135
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
marrying Si Yan is the best way.

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
But it's good.

137
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
You're his sister.

138
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
You're also my sister.

139
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Don't you always want to be my sister?

140
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Get out.

141
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
I hate to die as your sister.

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
I'm like this.

143
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
You're happy.

144
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Are you satisfied?

145
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Si Yan.

146
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Si Yan.

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I saw Director Shen went to see Lin Chuning.

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
The chef of this restaurant is a Frenchman.

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
The steak is the most authentic.

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I wanted to try it with you.

151
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
This way, please.

152
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
The one we ordered last time.

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
We'll order this.

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
What a coincidence.

155
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Is it convenient?

156
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Please enjoy.

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Chuning.

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Chuning.

159
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Now I'm with Si Yan.

160
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
I hope you don't mind what happened before.

161
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Chuning is not good at drinking.

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
I'll drink for her.

163
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Director Shen and Chuning are really kind.

164
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
They should be able to drink your wedding wine soon.

165
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
They're just newlyweds.

166
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Can they get to the final destination?

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Chuning has promised me.

168
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
We'll get married soon.

169
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Chuning.

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Congratulations.

171
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I can't afford your congratulations.

172
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Do you want me to congratulate you?

173
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Do you want to?

174
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I don't want to.

175
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
What's wrong with you?

176
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm talking to my sister.

177
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Don't interrupt.

178
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
Today is such a good day.

179
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Let's all be happy.

180
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,140
Let's eat.

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
Now you know why.

182
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
From the moment you stepped into the Lu family.

183
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,140
I can't wait to get you out of here.

184
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's too soon.

185
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
That birthday party.

186
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
You'll find Si Yan is not looking at you right.

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm afraid Si Yan will fall in love with you.

188
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I'm afraid there will be a situation like today.

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
So.

190
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I can accept that Xiaorou is my daughter.

191
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
But I want to kill you.

192
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
So.

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
You abandoned me.

194
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Is it because I'm a dead man?

195
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Because I'm a daughter.

196
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I understand.

197
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Chuning, you go.

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
You abandoned me again.

199
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I didn't abandon you.

200
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm going to send you to school.

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It's better than you're suffering day and night.

202
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble sooner or later.

203
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
What's the difference between you and abandoning me?

204
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Every time.

205
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,180
The person you want to abandon the most is me.

206
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Isn't it?

207
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
No need for him to go.

208
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
I'll go.

209
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
No.

210
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
You're the only son.

211
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
He won't agree.

212
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
I've contacted the school.

213
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Go out for the mountain class.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
After school.

215
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
You can come back and take over the street.

216
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
He won't disagree.

217
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm just right to read books and make jokes.

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
You can read the school without worry.

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
No need to hide anymore.

220
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
After I leave.

222
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I hope you can marry someone who really loves you.

223
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
The one I love.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I can't marry him.

225
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Tomorrow is the last day I'm here.

227
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Let's be willful for the last time.

228
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Change the partner.

229
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
This is so good.

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Have a bite.

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Give it back to me.

232
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
No.

233
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
No.

234
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
You give it to me.

235
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Give it back to me.

236
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Give it to me.

237
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I'll have a bite first.

238
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I'll have a bite.

239
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I saw you.

240
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Did I scare you?

241
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
You're so childish.

242
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Give it to me.

243
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
No.

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
No.

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
What?

246
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Give it to me.

247
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I'll give it to you if you call me brother.

248
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
I'll call you brother.

249
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Call the police.

250
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Taxi.

251
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Is it good?

252
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Yes.

253
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Here you are.

254
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Thank you.

255
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Are you done?

256
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
It's all your fault.

257
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Let's go.

258
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I'll buy more for you.

259
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Really?

260
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Yes.

261
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Let's buy more.

262
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm willing to be ugly.

263
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
I like dancing.

264
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I just want to be my friend.

265
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Let the night pass by.

266
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Let the night pass by.

267
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Wait for the dark to end.

268
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I hope we won't be brothers in the next life.

269
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
No.

270
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,240
I hope we won't meet in the next life.

271
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
No.

272
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You always say that children should be taken care of.

273
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Moreover, you went to Hong Kong.

274
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
You bought whatever you wanted.

275
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You sent back everything you needed.

276
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
You didn't feel wronged.

277
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
I know.

278
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,260
I'll take care of myself.

279
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Study hard and work hard.

280
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,260
Don't let your bad things go out.

281
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I know.

282
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Is it a waste of time?

283
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Your sister won't come to see you off.

284
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
It's good.

285
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Think of me occasionally.

286
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
But don't worry about me.

287
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Take care of yourself.

288
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
I'm leaving.

289
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Sit on my lap.

290
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I'll be back.

291
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm leaving.

292
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,280
I'm leaving.

293
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm leaving.

294
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm leaving.

295
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Give it back to me.

296
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Give it back to me.

297
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I told you to work hard.

298
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
You didn't give us any chance.

299
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
You let us be with you.

300
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
You're afraid of losing your power.

301
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Let me see.

302
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Which girl made our young master so worried?

303
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Chuning, I thought I was good at acting.

304
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
But I was easily seen by others.

305
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
You're my sister.

306
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I shouldn't have been so concerned about you.

307
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
But I can't control myself.

308
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,300
You're my fragrance.

309
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,300
If the moonlight is alone,

310
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I'll be sad and have no time to spend.

311
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Is this your house?

312
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
What are you drinking?

313
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Can I forget you?

314
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,320
You're the one I've been longing for.

315
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Time has passed.

316
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
The past is long gone.

317
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Where is the bitter night?

318
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Who is so far away from me?

319
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,320
I can only see the smile.

320
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Time flies.

321
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,320
The memories are still in my heart.

322
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,340
Who is so far away from me?

323
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,340
I can only see the smile.

324
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,340
Miss, I'm sorry I couldn't catch up.

325
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
I'm lonely and lonely.

326
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,340
You're crossing the dark bridge.

327
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,340
I'm not sure if I can get close to you.

328
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I look at the sand in the early morning.

329
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
The flowers are near the star.

330
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,340
I've dreamed of us meeting countless times.

331
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,340
But it's hard to get.

332
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,340
I have to leave a strong scar for myself.

333
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,360
I don't care about you.

334
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,360
If the sea can cut your back,

335
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I'll be your coat of arms.

336
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I'll be your coat of arms.

337
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Have you ever lost a piece of your heart?

338
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
If love is like a dream,

339
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,360
I'll be your coat of arms.

340
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,380
I'll be your coat of arms.

341
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
I'm crossing the dark bridge.

342
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,380
I'm not sure if I can get close to you.

343
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,380
You're crossing the dark bridge.

344
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I'm not sure if I can get close to you.

345
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I look at the sand in the early morning.

346
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
The flowers are near the star.

347
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I've dreamed of us meeting countless times.

348
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
But it's hard to get.

349
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I have to leave a strong scar for myself.

350
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,420
I don't care about you.

351
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,420
If the sea can cut your back,

352
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,420
I'll be your coat of arms.

353
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I'll be your coat of arms.

354
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Have you ever lost a piece of your heart?

355
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,420
If love is like a dream,

356
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I'll be your coat of arms.

357
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,440
I'd like to be in your arms.

358
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,440
The night breeze is so gentle.

359
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,440
It's like you're with me.

360
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,440
I'd like to be your coat of arms.

361
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,440
If love is like a dream,

362
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I'll be your coat of arms.

363
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,460
The night breeze is so gentle.
