Ha ha ha.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My darling is so nice.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She's much better than Lin Chuning.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000

You big-mouthed thing!

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Who let you...

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
I saw Lin Chunning!

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lin Chunning?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have a way to heaven, but you don't leave.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now that you've broken into the house,

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
come!

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Seal the whole Wenrou Town!

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You must catch Lin Chunning!

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you okay?

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was found.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can you still escape?

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can if I don't take you.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Lu Siye, I'm your sister.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're still here!

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
After them!

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Stop!

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Run!

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I thought you were running away.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why didn't you run?

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're not going to get away.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're not going to get away.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where did you get the gun?

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Of course I hid it in advance.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You think I'm stupid?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't leave any behind for myself.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you okay?

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm fine.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then let's go.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I told you to kill Lu Siye,

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but you didn't hurt Lin Chunning!

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't be angry.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's all because of those dogs.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We don't know anything.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Last time,

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you pretended to be Lu Siye

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to make Lin Chunning hate her.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But she didn't kill her,

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but she exposed our Wenrou Town.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You said this...

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll tell you.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Killing Lu Siye

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
was to make Lin Chunning stop thinking.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Bringing her to Wenrou Town

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
was to be with her forever.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And you?

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're trying to force her

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to do whatever you want.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wenren,

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
we shouldn't be

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so angry.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We have Lu Siye

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and it's enough.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now we have Lin Chunning.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What we should do

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is to stop them from doing it

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and deal with them.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You still have a card.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Xiaorong.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You smell so good.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It hurts?

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Remember this pain.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's all from Lin Chunning.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Your good friend Lin Chunning

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
has already

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
become the daughter

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
of the Lu family.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She could have helped you

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to get rid of the pain.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But she didn't.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She's not the one.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She's the one.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She's the one.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But she didn't.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why?

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because she

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
thinks you're dirty.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She's afraid you'll go out

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and seduce her brother, Lu Siye.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
now you know

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
who's good to you.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know who you should hate.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I know.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've asked the boatman

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to thank Lu family.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you really want to thank me,

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
don't bother me next time.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I must

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
avenge her.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll do it.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I saved your life.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Protect yourself.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't hurt me.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not hurt.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're the one who's hurt.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Lin Chunning.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Call me sister.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sister.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good girl.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Good girl.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My good nephew.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Good nephew.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Uncle

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
sent you

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to the road today.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I didn't expect

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you two are so close.

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
going to kill you

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
directly.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But now I changed my mind.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I want to play

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
a game with you.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Since you two

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
are so close,

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you answer at the same time.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who will die first?

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The same name.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you die,

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you'll both die.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Three.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Uncle, you killed me.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you think my father won't know?

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you stupid?

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He killed you. How would your father know?

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Two.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Mo Zhen is afraid that he'll be the one to blame.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Uncle, wait.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Choose you.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I met

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Boss Gao when I went to the Lu family to report the wedding.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I pretended that you two were seriously injured

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and made him go on a boat alone.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you. But I still need you

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to send us back to Lu Mansion.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I must thank you.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OK.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Although there is no blood relationship,

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
he is my uncle after all.

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He wants to kill me.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In the face of the interests,

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
family is nothing.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you and I both die,

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll be the one to blame.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Lu family's family business

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
will be in his hands sooner or later.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But we can't just go out

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and fight.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How do you know if you don't try?

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't worry.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have a good idea.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll go with you.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is this your idea?

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Everyone around is Boss Gao's man.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do we have any other options?

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OK. I'll go with you.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Boss Gao, come in right away.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't worry.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Boss Gao will not go out for a day.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The children of Yuying Hall

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
will not be allowed to be born for a day.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In your heart,

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you are the sister of all the children of Yuying Hall.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Not only my sister.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Will you help me?

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Talk about it.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I took you in for my father's sake.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How dare you eat the jade pot?

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Father, I'm innocent.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Master, Uncle is not a man of common sense.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But he treats you well.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't talk nonsense.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are slandering Uncle.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Father, you

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
can do it yourself.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Someone. Father.

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Si Yan and I met a traitor last night.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thanks to Uncle's help,

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we didn't have time

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to thank Uncle.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think Si Yan

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
treats me as a traitor.

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I did bad things.

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Father,

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
we can't let Uncle down

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
because of our misunderstanding.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Chuning,

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
are you pointing your brother

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
at your Uncle?

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course not.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think it was too dark last night.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He must have seen it wrong.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was too dark.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He must have seen it wrong.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you satisfied?

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Brother,

254
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
don't do anything that will make people misunderstand.

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Chuning,

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
send a message to your Uncle.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you for your help.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry, Uncle.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Chuning,

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
thanks to you,

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
get back to you.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's my duty.

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You wronged me, brother.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If Lu Si Yan

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
didn't get into trouble,

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Master Lu and Mrs. Lu

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
wouldn't have broken up with Boss Gao

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
for me.

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Besides,

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've never met anyone.

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Now,

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can only ask Lu Si Yan

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to do it.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
One, two, three.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
One, two, three.

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
One more.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
One more.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
One more.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Take it off.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes, you have to take it off.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, take it off.

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Come on.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Come on.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
One, two, three,

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
four, five, six,

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
seven, eight, nine,

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
ten, eleven, twelve,

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why did you count?

292
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I didn't mean to follow you.

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I just want to explain to you

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the water-resistant water-diving.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Water-diving?

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let me see.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I want to see.

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why don't you let me see?

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What a surprise.

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You went out late at night.

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How could you do that?

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We were just doing physical training.

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm talking about physical training.

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What's wrong?

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What do you think I'm talking about?

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Nothing.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Stop it.

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This is an aviation school.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're going to be a pilot.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So,

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
you didn't mean to go out.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You were just pretending to be stubborn.

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You just wanted to disappoint your parents.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You wanted to get married to me

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because you wanted to piss off your parents.

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So they could kick you out of the Lu family.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Then you could

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
learn to fly without any worries.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Right?

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a pity that you don't go to the acting school.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Now you know.

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Can you keep it a secret for me?

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You call me sister.

326
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll think about it.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't have to.

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can only

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
tell my parents.

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If they lock you up in the house,

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
they will beg me.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Sister.

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Good.

334
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a secret.

335
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I said I'll think about it.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Lin Chuning, you're cheating.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Lin Chuning.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You call me sister.

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Lin Chuning.

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How did you think about it?

342
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Come down and talk.

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Say it.

344
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's too much.

345
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How did you think about it?

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can keep it a secret for you.

347
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You have to promise me one thing.

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What else?

349
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Last year, Xiao Rou was forced to die.

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
She was in my arms.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Boss Gao said

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
he would bury her.

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I went to see her.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There was nothing in the tomb.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Xiao Rou didn't die?

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You guessed right.

357
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So I asked you to help me save Xiao Rou.

358
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll give Boss Gao a promotion.

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Deal.

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Good.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Pull the hook.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can't do it.

363
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What do you want?

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Lu Mansion is in danger.

365
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't be with you.

366
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So you need to protect yourself.

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What okay?

369
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You can't take me.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So you see,

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the power of a man and a woman is very limited.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
When you're not strong enough,

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you can use other ways.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Come on.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The same.

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If you're caught by someone,

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
you can try to hit him.

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When he's in pain,

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
turn around

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and turn around.

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Then...

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Miss,

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Master wants me to tell you

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
tomorrow is the day of the funeral.

385
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:44,260
La...

386
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,160
Madame Lu is back home.

387
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
The fire is out.

388
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Come.

389
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
?!"

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:18,640
efter

391
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,760
the

392
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,760
From now on, she can only be your sister.

393
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Why is the door locked?

394
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Master, this is not a good sign.

395
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to recognize the noble family today.

396
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
How about another day?

397
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I think this is a good sign.

398
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
It should be that the ancestors saw the sister came back.

399
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
So they closed the gate of the ancestral hall.

400
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Don't let the descendants of the Lu family stay outside.

401
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
This is Xiaorui.

402
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Go on.

Thank you for watching!
