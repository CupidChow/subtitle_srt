Episode 16

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Deputy Chief.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
You mean

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
you met Deputy Chief Lu by the river.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
He didn't remember anything after he woke up.

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
He's just a blank paper when he wakes up.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
What can we draw him?

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
He's just a blank paper.

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Deputy Chief.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Deputy Chief.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Deputy Chief.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Deputy Chief.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Who are you?

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Deputy Chief.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Don't you remember?

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Your surname is Gao.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Gao Siyan is the son of Gao Yunfeng.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm your wife, Xiaorou.

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
We've been married for two years.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
The reason you got hurt

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
was because of Lu's family.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Lu's family has always been our enemy.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
They've been trying to kill us all these years.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
It was Lu Chuning who caused you to be like this.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
He kept pestering you.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
That's why you became like this.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Lu Chuning

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
not only took our property

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
but also made your car accident.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
If you hadn't been so lucky,

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I would have been a black-haired man.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
He won't let us go.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Siyan, remember,

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
we're your family.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Family?

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Siyan, take care of yourself.

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
By the way,

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I've taken over Xianli City.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
We'll visit it again in a few days.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
We'll make Xianli City a big city.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Xiaorou, Siyan just woke up.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Go and prepare some food for her.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Let's go.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
The goods in the bag.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
The goods in the bag.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
The goods in the bag.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
The goods in the bag.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Come on.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
We bought some goods today.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It's so beautiful.

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's so beautiful.

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It's so beautiful.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Lu Chuning,

55
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
the game has just begun.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I'll make your Lu family

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
go bankrupt

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
and die.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Here it comes.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Here it comes.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Here it comes.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Here it comes.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Here it comes.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Here it comes.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Here it comes.

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Boss Kao,

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
you're really something.

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
No one has ever known

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
that you're the boss behind Xianli City.

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Director Shen,

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
look at what you said.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I've been looking for a job

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
to help me find a scapegoat.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Boss Kao,

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
the next step

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
is up to you

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
how to develop.

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't worry.

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Leave it to me.

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
What are you?

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You even want to climb

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
my son's bed?

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
You're not worth it.

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Men will miss their home

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
more when they become a family.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
With a wife,

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
they can practice

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
the art of drawing.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm doing this for you.

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm doing this for you.

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm doing this for you.

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm doing this for you.

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm doing this for you.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Lu Zhirou,

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm doing this for you.

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll kill you.

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Beat me.

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll tell Lu Si Yan

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
everything.

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Beat me.

101
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
You'd better stop

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
being crazy.

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Lin Chuning,

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
you're the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
God is still on my side.

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Dear friends,

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
today

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
we reopen the county.

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Thank you very much for coming.

111
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
In the past,

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
something bad happened in Xianli City.

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
But the boss has been punished.

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Now,

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm the new boss of Xianli City.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I promise you two things.

117
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
First,

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
we will be legally operated.

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Second,

120
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
we will be

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
one step ahead of the past.

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Today,

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
we will be open.

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
You can eat, drink,

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
and play.

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
All the expenses today

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
will be paid by me.

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Come on, friends.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Let's have a drink.

130
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay.

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Cheers.

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Miss, something bad happened.

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
A Cong, do you know?

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I saw Siyan yesterday.

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
I saw him.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Miss,

137
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
are you crazy?

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
No, you...

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Miss,

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
our goods are robbed.

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
What?

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
We have two ways of getting the goods.

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
We pay the protection fee every year.

144
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I don't know where these bandits came from.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
They just come up without saying anything.

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
They don't talk about the goods.

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Miss,

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
how about I explain to the customers

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
and let them be more lenient?

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
No.

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Now, the whole village is in danger.

152
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
The whole village is in danger.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Everyone is watching the weak bones of our Lu family.

154
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
If they know that

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
we don't even know the goods,

156
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
they will think we are easy to bully.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
How about this?

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Go and see if there are any

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
things we can buy.

160
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
No matter how much their family is,

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
we have them.

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
We must get them as soon as possible.

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Let us in.

164
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Let us in.

165
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
This is...

166
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Can you get out?

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Hurry up.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Let us in.

169
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Miss Lu,

170
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I heard that your goods were robbed.

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I have a lot of orders.

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
The customers are in a hurry to use tea.

173
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
How can I explain to them?

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
My goods are for delivery.

175
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Can I afford to pay you?

176
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Young Master,

177
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Master said that

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
you had too many enemies.

179
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You should go out and get dressed.

180
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
In case someone recognizes you and tries to find you.

181
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Pay the money.

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I know.

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Pay the money.

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Be quiet.

185
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Pay the money.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Pay the money.

187
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
No searching for the goods.

188
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Arrest those who took the goods.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I will punish them severely.

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
No wonder you couldn't deliver the goods.

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It turns out that you are colluding with the officials.

192
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Pay the money.

193
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Miss Lu,

194
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
my Young Master asked me to give this to you.

195
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
No.

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
You should have told me.

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I have the goods.

198
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Ten times.

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Si Yan.

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Chuning.

201
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You are wrong.

202
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
No.

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I am not wrong.

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
It's him.

205
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Only the thieves know what we lack.

206
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
They must have taken the goods.

207
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
They took our goods.

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
They even took our land price.

209
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
The sheep are on the sheep.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
They are so shameless.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
It's him.

212
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,600
That person must be him.

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Chuning.

214
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
You miss Si Yan too much.

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
So no matter who you look at,

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
you look like Lu Si Yan.

217
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
No.

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I recognize him.

219
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
This is his true self.

220
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
It's day time.

221
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You really see ghosts.

222
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Don't you think

223
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
this straightforward personality

224
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
is more like your Young Master?

225
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Indeed.

226
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Could it be that

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Young Master fell from the sky

228
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
and broke his brain?

229
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
A Cong.

230
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Give me the news.

231
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Tonight, the second batch of goods will be transported to the dock.

232
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I will personally transport them.

233
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes.

234
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I seem to have forgotten

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
something important.

236
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Si Yan.

237
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I made chicken soup for you.

238
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Drink it while it's hot.

239
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
You are pregnant now.

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
You are most likely to be in pain.

241
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Leave these things to the servants.

242
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
You should rest well.

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
How could I?

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
This is the happiest thing I've ever felt.

245
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Okay.

246
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I will drink later.

247
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Don't wait for me tonight.

248
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Lu Si Yan's second batch of goods will be transported to the dock tonight.

249
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
I will go out.

250
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Si Yan, you must be careful.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay.

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
If you see Lu Chuning,

253
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
don't believe anything he says.

254
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
He is very cunning.

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't worry.

256
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I will never let Lu Chuning

257
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
hurt your child again.

258
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I will wait for you at home with the child.

259
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I will go back early.

260
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Young Master, there is no one at the dock.

261
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
No one?

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I didn't expect that

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Miss Lu would use herself

264
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
to lure me out.

265
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Si Yan, is that you?

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
You are not dead.

267
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I am not dead.

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Are you disappointed?

269
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
What are you talking about?

270
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Si Yan,

271
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
what are you talking about?

272
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
What are you talking about?

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Let go.

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
You said

275
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
that if I don't let go,

276
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
you will hold my hand.

277
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
You are really

278
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
as the maid said, cunning and cunning.

279
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Maid?

280
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Let go.

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I won't go.

282
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Go.

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
My name is Gao Si Yan.

284
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Don't shoot.

285
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
He is not the Lu Si Yan

286
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
you know.

287
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
No.

288
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
He is Si Yan.

289
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
There is only one possibility.

290
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
He lost his memory.

291
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I know what to do.

292
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
The End

293
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Can I ask you

294
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
to dance with me?

295
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
No.

296
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Do we know each other?

297
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
You look

298
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
like someone I know.

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Really?

300
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Who is she?

301
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
What is her relationship with you?

302
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
We were brothers

303
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
and lovers.

304
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
No matter what kind of relationship

305
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
we have,

306
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
we care about each other the most.

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Can you

308
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
take off your mask

309
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
and let me see you?

310
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Please be careful.

311
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
After taking off this mask,

312
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
let you kill me again.

313
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Si Yan.

314
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I am not feeling well

315
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
these two months.

316
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Because I miss you so much.

317
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I miss you so much.

318
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I really miss you so much.

319
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I love you.

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Si Yan.

321
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Lin Chuning.

322
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Why are you so distracted?

323
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
You killed Si Yan.

324
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You want to kill him, right?

325
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I didn't.

326
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Si Yan.

327
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Xiaorou.

328
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Xiaorou, what's wrong?

329
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
I went into the birth control room.

330
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I moved the birth control.

331
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You fainted?

332
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
If you are fine,

333
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
rest at home and don't come out.

334
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Do you understand?

335
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Yes.

336
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Let's go.

337
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
You are three months old.

338
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
You will be pregnant in two months.

339
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
You should make a decision sooner.

340
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
You had a miscarriage.

341
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It will be hard to get pregnant.

342
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
You are pregnant.

343
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
If you continue like this,

344
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I will give you medicine.

345
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Thank you.

346
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Xiaorou.

347
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Xiaorou.

348
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You heard it, right?

349
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
The doctor said you were pregnant for three months.

350
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Si Yan lost two months of her pregnancy.

351
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Whose baby is it?

352
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
How to say?

353
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Actually, she and Si Yan are similar.

354
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
She should call you sister Tang.

355
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
It's Boss Gao's child.

356
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
You are pregnant.

357
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
You are pregnant.

358
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
You are pregnant.

359
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
You are pregnant.

360
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I can't understand you.

361
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
You are pregnant.

362
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
You are pregnant.

363
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You are pregnant.

364
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
You are pregnant.

365
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
You are pregnant.

366
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I don't know how to deal with you.

367
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Lu Chunniang.

368
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Why did you treat my child like this?

369
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Xiaorou.

370
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Si Yan.

371
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Are you okay?

372
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You...

373
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Idiot.

374
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
You...

375
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't want you to be with my child.

376
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I want you to die.

377
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Si Yan, let me go.

378
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Gao Si Yan.

379
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
This woman hurt you and even killed your wife.

380
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You must not be fooled by her.

381
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
You must not be treated like this.

382
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Xiaorou.

383
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Are you okay?

384
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Si Yan, our child is gone.

385
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We can keep the baby.

386
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
As long as you are okay.

387
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Step aside.

388
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
The patient needs to rest.

389
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
You should rest.

390
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Step aside.

391
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Si Yan, you must avenge me.

392
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Si Yan.

393
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Lu family is really evil.

394
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Especially you.

395
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You don't even let go of the baby.

396
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I want you to confess your crime to everyone.

397
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Otherwise, I will let you die now.

398
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Lu Si Yan.

399
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I really didn't expect that

400
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
you would become so stupid after you lost your memory.

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
You believe everything others say.

402
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
You won't be fooled so badly

403
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
even if you go to investigate.

404
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
You still dare to deny it.

405
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Even if other things are not confirmed,

406
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I saw you push Xiaorou.

407
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
You even want to deny this?

408
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
You are the one who is going to avenge us.

409
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Why do you want to kill this child?

410
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
If I really want to hurt him,

411
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I can give him a bottle of poison.

412
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
But why should I do this?

413
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Isn't it more serious to lose both lives?

414
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
And

415
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
a child who has not been born,

416
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
why should I hurt him?

417
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Do you want to kill me

418
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
because you are so attached to him?

419
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
You finally admit it.

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
You want to lose both lives.

421
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
You want to kill them.

422
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Why don't you admit your mistake?

423
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Why do you want me to admit my mistake?

424
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
You want to find

425
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
someone who can help you.

426
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
But you are afraid of the wrong person.

427
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
So you find me.

428
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Lu Si Yan, you are a coward.

429
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
You dare not to be a coward.

430
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay.

431
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Since you have decided to kill me,

432
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
you have the courage to avenge your wife

433
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
and kill me.

434
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Do you think I dare not?

435
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I will torture you slowly.

436
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
What did you tell me?

437
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
You are not afraid of people.

438
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
You are afraid of people.

439
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
So you are afraid of people too.

440
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
You are a red flower.

441
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You have a miscarriage.

442
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I won't let you live well.

443
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Lu Si Yan, are you crazy?

444
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Why don't you believe me?

445
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I have given you a chance.

446
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
As long as you admit your mistake

447
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
and beg me,

448
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I can not kill you.

449
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Beg me.

450
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I let you beg me.

451
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I let you beg me.

452
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I let you beg me.

453
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Beg me.

454
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Why don't you believe me?

455
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Beg me.

456
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
You kill me.

457
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Si Yan, don't kill him.

458
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Murder is common.

459
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
It's not worth it to kill yourself for him.

460
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
You leave him to me.

461
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I will not kill you

462
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
if you look at my wife.

463
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Lu Si Yan,

464
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
you are really stupid and scary.

465
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Lin Chu Ning,

466
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I won't let you die so easily.

467
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I will let you die

468
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
and torture you.

469
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I will let you

470
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
see the man I love most

471
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
sleeping with me.

472
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Lin Chu Ning,

473
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I won't let you die so easily.

474
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I will let you die

475
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
and torture you.

476
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I will let you

477
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
see the man I love most

478
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
sleeping with me.

479
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I will let you

480
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
see the man I love most

481
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
sleeping with me.

482
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I will let you

483
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600

484
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
sleeping with me.

485

I will let you

486

I will let you

489

490
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
sleeping with me.

491
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I will let you

492
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
see the fortune.

493
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I will let you

494
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
see the man I love most

495
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
sleeping with me.

I will let you

see the fortune.

498
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I will let you

499

500
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
