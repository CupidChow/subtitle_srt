1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,600
I hope that she won't tell those things to anyone else scolding you,

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,220
or usually scolding and dissuading you.

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,220
Hey!

4
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,220
I never thought I was a good person.

5
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,020
But I never thought

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
one day

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,420
I would meet a man

8
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,820
who has been with me for a thousand times.

9
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,480
His

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,480
revenge was a mistake.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
He is my brother.

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
I am sorry.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
I am sorry.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I am sorry.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
I am sorry.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I am sorry.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I am sorry.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
He is also my lover.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
We also called each other mountain goddesses.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
We also lived our lives together.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
But now

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
I just want to be by his side and escape.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Sister.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I caught you.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
From Yesterday

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,640
Tonight is a new

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
Tonight is the annual

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
Lu's Department Store's new decoration show.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,400
The famous and powerful people will come to watch.

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
Sisters, you have to dress up seriously.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
Whether you can fly straight up

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
depends on tonight.

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
Brother, you are officially taking over

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Lu's Department Store today.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,800
It's a wish of your father.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,920
I brought Mo Chen with me today

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,720
to congratulate you.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,440
Brother, congratulations.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,600
Let me give you a toast.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,480
Brother, I really admire you.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,600
The people around you are all good-looking.

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
You are better than any of them.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
You are indeed a good-looking man.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
You are a master.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
Brother-in-law of the Ministry of Rites,

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
as long as you can coax my sister,

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
you can be rich and rich.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,840
You don't have to do anything.

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
Mo Chen, look.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
I personally picked this model.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
She is a model of Lu's Department Store.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
It's so beautiful.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Is this

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,040
Lu's Department Store's new decoration show's

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
surprise?

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
Wow.

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,200
This must be the next Lu's Supermodel.

59
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I didn't expect that my Lu's Department Store

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,040
would have such a beautiful person.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
Supermodel,

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,760
I'd like to see

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,400
how you can make it today.

64
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,400
This one is good.

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,240
If you like it,

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
please come back to the store

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
and measure it.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
No need to bother.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll take this one from you.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll pack it up for you.

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
I'll take it now.

72
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
This one is good.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
It's so beautiful.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
Miss Lu,

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,160
did you do something wrong?

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
Mo Chen,

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
I want it now.

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
If the police say you changed it,

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
you must change it.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Chief Lu,

81
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,680
it looks like you accepts

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
the items in the store and offers a trial by next season.

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
Bosses and honing station,

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,320
please hurry up to collect it yourself.

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,520
supervisor,

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
and start to play the music.

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
Isn't it too advanced?

88
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Brother.

89
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Put the strings away.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
You can eat soft food.

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,160
But don't be so hard on the outside.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
Be careful not to digest it.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,960
Listen up, everyone.

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
In the Lu family,

95
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,440
the rule of my Lu Si Yan is

96
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
not to let beauty

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
be bullied.

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,020
Although he never distant himself from beauty

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,260
in the world,

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,420
it seems Fury

101
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,680
can never以前

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,020
have to face off against the wingman.

103
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Let's go!

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
You...

105
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I heard that you were scolded by your father for rejecting Lian Ying for several days.

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
How about you go live with me today?

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I'll help you get rid of your anger.

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
You're too greedy.

109
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
I'll accompany you during the day,

110
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
and I'll accompany others at night.

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
I have a date.

112
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Go in.

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Be careful.

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Let me go.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Come here.

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Don't move.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Come here.

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Or I'll shoot.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
All the women around Lu Si Yan are mine.

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Do you think she'll remember you?

121
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Who do you think gave you this gun?

122
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
The young master gave it to me.

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
If you don't want to offend her, let me go.

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Even a little white flower won't want someone.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Interesting.

126
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Chase her.

127
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
I want her to know

128
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,520
what will happen to me if you offend her for Lu Si Yan.

129
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Stop.

130
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Stop.

131
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Okay.

132
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Don't come over.

133
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Didn't you just stop?

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Go back to the police station.

135
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't be so rude.

136
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't come over.

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Go.

138
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Wait.

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I'll see who dares to touch her.

140
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You're looking for death.

141
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
You're looking for death.

142
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You're looking for death.

143
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You're looking for death.

144
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
You're looking for death.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
You're looking for death.

146
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
You're looking for death.

147
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
You're looking for death.

148
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
You're looking for death.

149
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
You're looking for death.

150
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
You're looking for death.

151
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
You're looking for death.

152
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
You're looking for death.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
You're looking for death.

154
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
You're looking for death.

155
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
You're looking for death.

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
You're looking for death.

157
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
You're looking for death.

158
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
You're looking for death.

159
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
You're looking for death.

160
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
You're looking for death.

161
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
You're looking for death.

162
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
You're looking for death.

163
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
You're looking for death.

164
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
You're looking for death.

165
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
You're looking for death.

166
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
You're looking for death.

167
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
You're looking for death.

168
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
You're looking for death.

169
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm not concerned about you

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
If the sea can see your back

171
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
The sky is not a fake

172
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm not concerned about you

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Have you ever been in the past

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,520
If love is like a dream, it is like a hug

175
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Are you okay?

176
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,520
I'm willing to be in your arms

177
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Does your foot hurt?

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I'm still at the bottom of the cliff

179
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
It's okay. I'll take you away.

180
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,420
I'm also a

181
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
The roadside buried by the shore

182
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
No one cares

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Full of old memories for myself

184
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm not concerned about you

185
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,520
If the sea can see your back

186
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
The sky is not a fake

187
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm not concerned about you

188
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
You grew up in Yunyi Hall

189
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Sorry

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm late

191
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Young master

192
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
My sister said

193
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Men are not good

194
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
You are like Director Shen

195
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Afraid I'll fall in love with you

196
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Or afraid I'll fall in love with you

197
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Not responsible for you

198
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
I

199
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Don't move

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Don't move

201
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Young master

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Can you keep me by your side

203
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm afraid Director Shen will find me a trouble

204
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Of course

205
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm afraid you'll be too tired

206
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
You are too rude

207
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I don't like it

208
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Don't be so serious

209
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
How can she believe it

210
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I know her

211
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm not like her

212
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
I'm thinking it over

213
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Xiaorou

214
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes

215
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Chuning

216
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,040
I think this is too dangerous

217
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,280
to buy it.

218
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,120
No.

219
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,160
He has already bought it.

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
A stubborn child like Luo Si Yan

221
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,400
has long been used to

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
the women who came to the door.

223
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,600
How can he let go

224
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
when he suddenly sees a different one?

225
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,240
A stubborn and smart little white flower.

226
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,520
You're good at acting.

227
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,240
But

228
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,560
how did you convince Shen Mo Chen

229
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,720
to act with you?

230
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,200
He's busy climbing up with a mind.

231
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
Unless you two have known each other for a long time

232
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,880
and have been in touch

233
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,640
and set up a trap for me.

234
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,640
Am I right?

235
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,360
I was still thinking

236
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,920
when it would be more interesting

237
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
to be exposed to you.

238
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,240
I see the face of the oil

239
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,680
is just a momentary freshness.

240
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,920
If it is not clear,

241
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
it is more

242
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,120
confusing.

243
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,840
Isn't it?

244
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,960
You're smart.

245
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,280
I like smart women.

246
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
Young Master,

247
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
what does a smart woman like me

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,760
need to do?

249
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,960
Get married.

250
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,320
Why are you here to take me to try on clothes?

251
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,480
I plan to announce the truth

252
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,360
on my birthday party tonight.

253
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,960
Change.

254
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,600
So I need to be experienced.

255
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
Change again.

256
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Why are you so tensed up?

257
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,120
Let's go back

258
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
to school.

259
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,920
How do you feel?

260
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,920
If you're a hundred days in prison,

261
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
it is natural to have a qizi

262
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,280
with tender feelings,

263
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
a filial son-in-law,

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
to show your true self.

265
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,600
They'll hate you

266
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
and think that marrying you is a shame.

267
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,360
You'd better drive me out of the Lu family.

268
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,880
Do you understand?

269
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,000
If that's the case,

270
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,880
fine.

271
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,880
I've been wearing a safety buckle since I was a kid.

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
It's a pair with this one.

273
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
You've been wearing it all the time?

274
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,120
I wear it occasionally.

275
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,200
My mother gave it to me.

276
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,320
Do you like it?

277
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,400
If it's really a pair,

278
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
is it possible that

279
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,040
Xiaorou is actually the daughter of the Lu family?

280
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,600
Tonight,

281
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,400
I'll announce this good news in public.

282
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,360
Madam,

283
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,600
okay.

284
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,360
If that's the case,

285
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
tonight's birthday party

286
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
will be very exciting.

287
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,520
Thank you, Madam.

288
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
I'll get you a cup of tea.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,760
Thank you.

290
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,320
Brother.

291
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
Happy birthday.

292
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,600
Here.

293
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,040
Happy birthday.

294
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,680
Thank you, Father.

295
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,960
Who is this lady?

296
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,680
I've never seen her before.

297
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Isn't she the lady who fell from the sky

298
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,240
on the show that day?

299
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
It's her.

300
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,280
She was invited to

301
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,760
the birthday party of Young Master Lu.

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
No wonder she was able to

303
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
come out of the party that day

304
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
and search the room.

305
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,120
Young Master Lu even helped her out.

306
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,440
It seems that their relationship

307
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
is not ordinary.

308
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
You're right.

309
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,080
But she's really beautiful.

310
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,680
Sorry.

311
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
I'll help you.

312
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm late.

313
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,080
It's okay.

314
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
At least she's here.

315
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,620
She didn't mention the

316
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,960
important things.

317
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,200
Of course.

318
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,240
Very good.

319
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,960
Everyone,

320
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,560
welcome to the show.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
Today,

322
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm going to announce

323
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,920
a very important news.

324
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Her appearance

325
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,680
is like the God's punishment for me.

326
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,520
She

327
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
is going to be my...

328
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,480
I was

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
really trying to use you

330
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,560
to enter the Lu family.

331
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,640
From then on, I'll be rich and rich.

332
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,080
But now I found

333
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,760
that I can do the same

334
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,480
without you.

335
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,960
Don't talk.

336
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,520
Good evening, everyone.

337
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,760
Actually,

338
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
today is not only

339
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
Young Master Lu's birthday,

340
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,480
but also my birthday.

341
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
Let me introduce myself to you.

342
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm Lu Si Yan,

343
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
the mother of my father.

344
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,640
I was born on the same day

345
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
of the same month and month.

346
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
My name is Lu Chuning.

347
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm Lu Chuning.

348
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm Lu Chuning.

349
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,600
I'm Lu Chuning.

350
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm Lu Chuning.

351
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,440
Fooled byップ

352
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

353
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,240
What's going on?

354
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,320
What is it?

355
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,280
What's going on?

356
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,200
Sister,

357
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,720
there is something wrong with him.

358
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
So 사람eless!

359
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,560
What happened?

360
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,440
What happened?

361
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:26,200
вам

362
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,320
Vaginal rain

363
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,380
Rainfall

364
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,800
Release of melissa

365
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,680
Flower

366
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,980
You

367
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,940
Empty all the sand strained by the resting water

368
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,380
나올 à ces éuma

369
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,180
Imagine that in countless times

370
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,980
we had only met

371
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,540
which is hard to forget

372
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,280
Austerity of strong property

373
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,540
I had used it

374
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,300
For you

375
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
If the sea turns your back,

376
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
I will be your armor.

377
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,300
If the sky turns my back,

378
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
will the flow of the flow ever change?

379
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
If love is like a dream,

380
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I will embrace you in my dreams.

381
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,300
I am willing to be in your arms forever.

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
there is no end.

385
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
You are like a moon that does not block the path.

386
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I am only close to you.

387
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
When I return to the bottom of the sea,

388
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
I will be like a fallen leaf.

389
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
I am like a floating skin that is buried in the shore.

390
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I cannot help but feel anxious.

391
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I am giving myself a strong and strong courage.

392
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I have nothing to do with you.

393
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,300
If the sea turns your back,

394
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
I will be your armor.

395
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
If the sky turns my back,

396
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
will the flow of the flow ever change?

397
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
If love is like a dream,

398
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I will embrace you in my dreams.

399
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I am willing to be in your arms forever.

400
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,300
The night view outside the sea,

401
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I am with you.

402
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,300
I am willing to turn into a whale in the sea.

403
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,300
If love is like a storm,

404
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,300
I cannot stop it.

405
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,300
The wind is covering my traces.

406
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,300
