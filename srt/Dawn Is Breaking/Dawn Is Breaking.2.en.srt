[Episode 2]
[Plundering]

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,360
What do you want?

5
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,760
I intended to kill you,

6
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,600
but now, I want you to marry me.

7
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,840
Outrageous!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm the Crown Princess-to-be.

9
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,400
Preceptor,

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,960
as a man of virtue,

11
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
how could you speak so disrespectfully?

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,280
I've never claimed to be a virtuous man.

13
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
I enjoy taking what others desire

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
and exploiting their weaknesses.

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,480
Let go!

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
What's going on?

17
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,280
The pulse shows signs of poisoning.

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,120
Don't move.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I've never put earrings
on a woman before.

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,920
If I miss the spot,

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
it'll cause you pain.

22
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
When you were a child,
did you have a red mole under your eye?

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
How do you know that?

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
The 13th day of the eighth month
is an auspicious day.

25
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll come to marry you then.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,480
Don't even think about it.

27
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,080
His Majesty and His Highness
won't allow it.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
We'll see.

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,880
You...

30
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,850
[Xiao Zhi]

31
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,920
Master.

32
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,080
How are things with the Emperor?

33
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
Everything is ready.

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,680
The Emperor has summoned you.

35
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,520
Weren't we supposed to summon
divine lightning on the wedding day

36
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
to kill the Crown Princess

37
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,800
and solidify the Crown Prince's
divine punishment? Why save her?

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Has something changed?

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
She's an old acquaintance.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Indeed, things have changed.

41
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,880
Though she isn't dead,

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
she's not far from it.

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,640
I secretly checked her pulse.

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,800
She's deeply poisoned,

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,760
near death.

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,640
The Crown Princess is your acquaintance?

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,640
No need to call her
Crown Princess anymore.

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Why not?

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
I want to marry her.

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
With all due respect,

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,920
this divine punishment
isn't related to Miss Xie.

52
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
The issue lies
within the Crown Prince's fate.

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
According to my divination,

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,920
Your Majesty, you have a son

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
whose fate is extremely noble.

56
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,640
However, it doesn't entirely match
the Crown Prince's fate.

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,360
What do you mean, Preceptor?

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
I have a son

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
with an extraordinary fate,

60
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,630
but he isn't the Crown Prince?

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
Then who is he?

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,880
Your Majesty, perhaps you'll have
more than one son.

63
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
I dare not say more.

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
I only caught a glimpse
of the divine secret

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
and tried to interpret it
for Your Majesty.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,620
Preceptor.

67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,200
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,160
Bad news, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,280
The Duke has...

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,790
He's...

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,160
He's passed away.

72
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,080
What?

73
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Quickly, tell me what happened.

74
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,280
Today,

75
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,480
the Duke's body was found
on the mountain top.

76
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,360
His body was pierced by an arrow.

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
This is Your Majesty's personal affair.

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
I'll take my leave.

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
Crown Prince,

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,080
you dared to commit
such an outrageous crime.

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,600
Your Majesty, please calm down.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,960
How...how could this
be the Crown Prince?

83
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
The Duke hadn't been to Andu

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,160
in over 20 years.

85
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,800
Who could he have a grudge with?

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Tell me,

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,160
who could he have a grudge with?

88
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,400
He merely helped me draw a divination

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,840
which was unfavorable
to the Crown Prince.

90
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,400
And coincidentally, he died tonight.

91
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
Is Your Majesty implying...

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,520
This marriage is annulled.

93
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,200
[Xie Mansion]

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,040
Miss,

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
thank the gods

96
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
you're safe.

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,280
Your parents have been
worried sick these days,

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
fearing the Crown Prince
would punish you.

99
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,200
Miss.

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Father, mother,

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
I have something...

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,760
Why are you always so rash?

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,640
[Wanyin's father]

104
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,160
Come, try the Preceptor's top-class tea.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,080
[Wanyin's mother]
Its calming effects are extraordinary.

106
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
Is this from you?

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Yes, it's from me.

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,840
You've already drunk it?

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Thanks to your parents' kindness,

110
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
they've already had

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,920
three cups.

112
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
You poisoned my parents?

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,010
It's tea.

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,240
Its calming effects

115
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,960
are extraordinary.

116
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Yin.

117
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,760
The Xie family commands
100 thousand troops in Youzhou.

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,640
My father used to fight near the Han Sea
and holds the title of Imperial Duke.

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,080
My brother Xie Tinghan
recaptured Liang Mountain

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
and was ennobled at the age 16.

121
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,280
Preceptor Dongfang,

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
I know you hold high office,

123
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,400
but the Xie family is not a family
to be trifled with.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Oh,

125
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,440
is that so?

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,160
Yin,

127
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
you're very rude.

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,280
My daughter is reckless.
Please don't take offense, Preceptor.

129
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
The Preceptor gifted us top-class tea

130
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,840
and even sent attendants
to assist your brother.

131
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,080
What?

132
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,280
You...

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,920
Yin.

134
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,550
With the Preceptor's help,

135
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,150
your brother will be invincible
in future battles.

136
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
The Preceptor has done our family
a huge favor.

137
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
How can you be so rude?

138
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,110
Father...

139
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
Dongfang Zui, I...

140
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,120
Yin!

141
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,560
Master, Madam,

142
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
an imperial edict has arrived.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,280
Let's go receive it.

144
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,690
The nation praises

145
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
you as righteous and virtuous,

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
but I think only I know the truth.

147
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,560
You're nothing but a madman
full of wickedness.

148
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
You were going to silence me?

149
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll offer my life

150
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
in exchange for my family's safety.

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,880
Silence you?

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,820
There's no need.

153
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,560
You can tell the entire nation.

154
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,240
Let's see how many people will believe

155
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,680
I killed the Duke.

156
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,000
You poisoned my parents

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,470
and placed spies around my brother.

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,400
What's your true intention?

159
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I want to marry you.

160
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,640
The Xie family,
all four of us,

161
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
would rather die
than be humiliated like this.

162
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,800
Are you sure it's just four of you?

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,000
I seem to recall the Xie family

164
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
commands 100 thousand troops in Youzhou.

165
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Dongfang Zui,

166
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
you've done so much evil.

167
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,520
You'll face

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
retribution one day.

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,640
I've never believed in fate.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Miss Xie of the Youzhou Xie Family
is known

171
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
for her sincerity and gentle nature.

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,200
I hereby marry her to Dongfang Zui,
the State Preceptor.

173
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,870
They'll be a match made by the gods

174
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,750
and blessed by the stars.

175
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll find Miss Xie a noble match

176
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,000
who holds no power in court.

177
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,160
Your Majesty is thorough,

178
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,120
but who do you...

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
Within the Great Yu,

180
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
isn't there already a suitable man?

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,880
Your Majesty means the State Preceptor?

182
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
But my daughter

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,480
is already married to the Crown Prince,
how can this...

184
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,840
His Majesty's decision is final

185
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
and not to be questioned.

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Is the Xie family loyal

187
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
to the Crown Prince or His Majesty?

188
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
Thank His Majesty for his grace.

189
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,960
His Majesty also decreed

190
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
from this day forward,

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
Miss Xie will remain
in seclusion at home

192
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,320
and no one shall visit her.

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,440
Thank His Majesty for his grace.

194
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
What? Grandfather died?

195
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
When did this happen?

196
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
On the day of your wedding
with Miss Xie.

197
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,360
Your Highness,

198
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,080
Dongfang Zui is suspicious.

199
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,800
I saw him shooting and killing the Duke
on Liangwei Mountain.

200
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,200
Dongfang Zui

201
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,440
really killed

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,120
grandfather?

203
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Dongfang Zui?

204
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Wake up, Chi.

205
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,960
Dongfang Zui has no grievances
with your grandfather.

206
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
Why would he kill him?

207
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
Then what do you mean, mother?

208
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
Suspicion breeds
in the hearts of emperors.

209
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
Throughout history,

210
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
how many have met a good end
under royal power?

211
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,680
Are you suspecting father?

212
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
If not him, then who else?

213
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Liangwei Mountain is heavily guarded.

214
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
Who else could

215
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
take the life of his father-in-law?

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,720
You grandfather died so many days ago

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,840
yet he kept it secret
without announcing the funeral.

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
What is he plotting?

219
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
He forced your wife
to marry someone else.

220
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,080
Who fears the Xie family's
military power

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,040
and even you and me?

222
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,040
Outrageous!

223
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,320
How dare you intrude
into the Empress's palace!

224
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,480
I come under His Majesty's order

225
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
to seal off the palace

226
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,480
and set up an altar for prayer.

227
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,960
I request Your Majesty and Your Highness
to fast and meditate.

228
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,800
Don't move around casually.

229
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,360
So I wouldn't scare
Your Majesty and Your Highness

230
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
when I pray.

231
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,600
So His Majesty wants to imprison us?

232
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,440
Your Majesty is exaggerating.

233
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
The Royal Stele has collapsed

234
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,320
so we're simply setting up an altar
to pray in accordance with divine will.

235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,840
I hope Your Majesty won't
make things difficult for me.

236
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,600
Mother...

237
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,960
Guards,

238
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,840
escort His Highness
back to his residence.

239
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,800
Your Highness,

240
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,480
please.

241
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Seal off the palace.

242
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,900
What?

243
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,410
This is treason!

244
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,920
Treason!

245
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,960
Dongfang Zui is using the Xie Army
to force me into marriage.

246
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,040
How can I prevent him
from threatening my family?

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,040
There's one last way.

248
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,580
[Xie Wanyin and Dongfang Zui's
wedding banquet]

249
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,070
Madam,

250
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,530
the master said,

251
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,680
it's cold at night.

252
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
Please wait for him inside.

253
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,000
What else did the Preceptor say?

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
My master also said,

255
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,080
this mansion has

256
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
over a hundred rooms

257
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,760
and more than a hundred servants,

258
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,040
all under your control.

259
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,480
If there's anything you want,

260
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,840
just let me know.

261
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,400
He's quite generous.

262
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,720
With wars breaking out over the years,

263
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
the national treasury is running low.

264
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,600
A man who practices Taoism

265
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
lives in such a large mansion

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
with over a hundred servants.

267
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,760
Does His Majesty

268
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,920
know about this?

269
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
All of this was granted by His Majesty.

270
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
His Majesty personally granted it?

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
Madam, you may not know.

272
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,720
My master can read the heavens

273
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,740
and foresee fortune.

274
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,490
He reveals the divine secrets
for the Great Yu

275
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,360
and saves people from calamities.

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
Last year's flood in the west

277
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
and the rebellion in the east

278
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,480
were all predicted by my master.

279
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,280
My master deeply worries himself
for the people of this land.

280
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,320
Madam,

281
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,310
I'll take my leave now.

282
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,050
I never imagined Dongfang Zui
was so unfathomable.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,800
It seems

284
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,680
if I don't strike with precision today,

285
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
it'll lead to endless troubles.

286
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,280
Madam,

287
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
the night is long.

288
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
There's no rush.

289
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm not in a hurry.

290
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,080
But my dear,

291
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,200
you might have to take your leave first.

292
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Madam, your aim is accurate,

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,880
but I'm not like ordinary people.

294
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,680
My heart is on the right side.

295
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
If you want to kill me, aim here.

296
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,560
I know it's not easy to hurt you,

297
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,280
so I smeared the blade
with a deadly poison.

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,280
The blade didn't even penetrate.

299
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
What can poison do to me?

300
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
The poison isn't on the blade.

301
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,040
It's on the hilt.

302
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
Madam, your ruthless nature

303
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,320
truly makes us a perfect match.
