But the most important thing now

189
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
is to stay away from the source
of the poison.

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
Now,

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,960
the poison has entered
your internal organs.

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
If it worsens

193
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,840
and it enters the bone marrow,

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,960
there'll be

195
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
no cure.

196
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Go quickly

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,960
and don't delay.

198
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
Your Highness,

199
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,080
please come with me.

200
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Go, Yin.

201
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'll take my leave.

202
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
Go ahead.

203
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
Come out now.

204
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,840
Can't bear to see her suffer?

205
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,840
Then why did you poison her
in the first place?

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm destined to ascend to the throne.

207
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
After Yin becomes the Empress,

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,760
if her family became too powerful,

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,600
the poison would be just a last resort.

210
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Now that Dongfang Zui
has also poisoned her,

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,480
it's not my fault.

212
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,480
When Yin's poison is triggered,

213
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
I'll be the only one who can save her.

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Dongfang Zui will have to let go.

215
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,680
This way,

216
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
she'll come back to me.

217
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
This time,

218
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll protect her well.

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
Yin, you're back.

220
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,960
What did Her Majesty summon you for?

221
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Yin?

222
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
Yin?

223
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Yin,

224
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
are you alright?

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,720
You look troubled.

226
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm fine.

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,160
Why is everyone doing embroidery?

228
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,840
After you left,

229
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,800
Eunuch De came to deliver
Her Majesty's order.

230
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
She wants everyone to complete
an embroidery piece.

231
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
You should get started too.

232
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
You were right.

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,400
I guess

234
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Her Majesty is selecting

235
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,160
a princess for His Highness,

236
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,600
so she's evaluating noblewomen.

237
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,960
Everyone knows Miss Jiang

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
is the best at embroidery.

239
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
You should be careful.

240
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,240
Has Her Majesty taken a liking to you?

241
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,040
Nonsense.

242
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
I specifically chose
the most understated thread

243
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
and embroidered a plain flower.

244
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,280
Don't worry.

245
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,160
I won't compete with the others.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm not fond of doing these things.

247
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm going outside for a bit.

248
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,120
Carry on with your work.

249
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,080
Miss Jiang is truly

250
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
virtuous and reserved.

251
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,440
Minister Jiang,

252
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,840
you've raised your daughter well.

253
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
My daughter

254
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,280
has been trained by Virtues of Woman
and Lessons for Women.

255
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,040
Though she's simple-minded
and slow-witted,

256
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,920
she's obedient and well-behaved.

257
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,640
For women,

258
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
too much intelligence

259
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
leads to trouble.

260
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Simplicity and obedience

261
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
are

262
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,080
virtues of women.

263
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,360
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

264
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,080
Minister Jiang,

265
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,400
your good days

266
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
are still ahead of you.

267
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
My daughter

268
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,440
is humble and unworthy.

269
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,360
If she were to receive
Your Majesty's favor in the future,

270
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,160
I'd be eternally grateful.

271
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,680
Rise.

272
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Mother,

273
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,320
is the assassin

274
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,840
who attempts to kill father ready?

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Father still harbors suspicion
towards you and me.

276
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,840
We must

277
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,080
succeed today.

278
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,480
Failure is not an option.

279
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,800
Assassin!

280
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,640
Assassin!

281
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,280
Guards! Protect me!

282
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,720
Protect me!

283
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,480
Father, watch out!

284
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm willing to die to protect you.

285
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Please consider yourself

286
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,240
and leave immediately.

287
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
Dongfang Zui!

288
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,440
Ouch.

289
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,800
Chi,

290
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,640
are you hurt?

291
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,360
I'm fine, father.

292
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,200
You did well this time.

293
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
What?

294
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,280
When faced with danger,

295
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
you called out your husband's name.

296
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm pleased.

297
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,720
How dare they!

298
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,640
They acted

299
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,040
so recklessly

300
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,360
under my nose!

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,520
Remember,

302
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,320
no matter what happens,

303
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll always be by your side.

304
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,480
Chi, take me back now.

305
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Hurry!

306
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Yin!

307
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Dongfang Zui,

308
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,360
should I trust you?

309
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,680
