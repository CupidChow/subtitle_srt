Your dumplings...

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,480
General Xie,

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,400
where do you think
you're taking my consort?

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
You disregard the Emperor

194
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,800
and corrupt the harem.

195
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
You rebel,

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,920
what do you have to say for yourself?

197
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,560
Yue,

198
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
hide behind me.

199
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Seize him!

200
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Tinghan...

201
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
Don't be afraid, Yue.

202
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,440
Your Majesty,

203
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,120
it was my improper behavior.

204
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,720
I beg Your Majesty to spare him.

205
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Your Majesty!

206
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
You certainly deserve punishment,

207
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,160
but this rebel

208
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,960
can't be allowed to live.

209
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
Your Majesty!

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,760
For the loyalty of the Xie Army,

211
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,080
please spare him,

212
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Your Majesty!

213
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
The more you pity

214
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,760
and protect him,

215
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,440
the more I want him dead!

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,400
Your Majesty!

217
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,040
Preceptor,

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
what are you doing?

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,360
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
please calm down.

221
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,560
There may be a misunderstanding.

222
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Misunderstanding?

223
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
Just now, when I was playing chess
with General Xie,

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
we heard a tiger's roar.

225
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,560
There are tigers in the forests
of Liangwei Mountain.

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,600
So,

227
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,600
General Xie and I came separately

228
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
to protect Your Majesty.

229
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,640
A tiger?

230
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,160
A tiger!

231
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Protect me!

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
Protect me!

233
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
There's really a tiger!

234
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,720
Your Majesty,

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,480
I observed the stars last night

236
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
and saw the child
in Miss Jiang's womb

237
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,400
carries a noble destiny,

238
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,160
fit to inherit the throne.

239
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,640
Is that true?

240
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Absolutely.

241
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Furthermore, General Xie has
a lethal star in his destiny.

242
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
With the ongoing war against Dafeng,

243
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
killing such a war hero

244
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
would harm the nation's fortune.

245
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

246
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,320
Well...

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Your Majesty,

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
I beg you.

249
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,840
It was me.

250
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
It was all my fault.

251
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,280
I promise

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
to remain dutiful,

253
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,040
to bear you many sons

254
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,640
and to never stray again.

255
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,320
You'd better mean it.

256
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,800
Take Consort Li back to the palace.

257
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,840
Without my order,

258
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
she can't leave her chambers.

259
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,120
Take her away.

260
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,560
No.

261
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,440
No.

262
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
As for you,

263
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,680
you violated the natural order

264
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
and betrayed my trust.

265
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
I strip you of your rank and title.

266
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,840
You're now a servant

267
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
to guard the Xuande Gate

268
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,520
