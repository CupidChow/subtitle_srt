Master,

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,840
the Crown Prince is here.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
I haven't even confronted him yet.

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,240
Why is he here?

8
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,000
He said

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
during the Women's Gathering,

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
thanks to you for summoning the guards,

11
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
His Majesty was saved.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,640
He came to thank you.

13
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,240
He was the one who hired the assassin.

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
He tried to gain sympathy
by pretending to be injured.

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,520
His plan failed,

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,440
backfiring on him

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
and harming my wife.

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,000
How dare he come to my mansion
to put on a show?

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,200
Maybe

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
he has the antidote.

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Go meet him.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
I heard ever since
the Women's Gathering,

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
your wife has been suffering
from a strange illness.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
She's been unconscious for days.

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,760
I came to deliver medicine.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Oh?

27
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,720
How kind you are, Your Highness.

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040
Only the royal family has the power

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,680

and medicines to save lives.

30

I'll spare no effort
from the Eastern Palace

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,720
to save her.

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Return her?

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,360
Yin isn't some object

37
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
that can be called upon

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,880

Besides,

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,640
she isn't ill.

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
She's been poisoned.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Where's the antidote?

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200

only I

46
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,920
can save her.

47
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,120
Preceptor Dongfang,
if you truly care for Yin's life,

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,640
don't act on impulse

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,800
and endanger her further.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
She's my wife.

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
I won't put her in danger.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
