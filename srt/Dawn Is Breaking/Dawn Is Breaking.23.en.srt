Yes?

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,960
Miss Xie has been away
from the army for years

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,960
yet she still holds control
over the Xie Army.

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,240
What did His Highness say?

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,800
We should intercept
and kill her in Zhangzhou.

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Absolutely not.

11
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,880
His Highness said

12
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
we should keep her alive.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
After she's gathered the bodies,

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,600
she can return to Andu on her own.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Well...

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,960
His Highness is being too sentimental.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
This woman can't be left alive.

18

Keeping her in this world

19

Why is there a bedroll here?

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,800
That doesn't sound like
a name from Dafeng.

My father is from Dafeng.

Nonsense.

Are you hurt?

96
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
Just a small wound, nothing serious.

97
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
I can't talk.

98

100
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,160
It must be fate.

101
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,120
We're not getting out of here, are we?

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm about to die, aren't I?

103
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Don't think like that.

104
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,920
Hold on.

They're here to take me away.

108
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
We'll be reunited soon.

109
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
You know,

110
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
your breathing and footsteps

111
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
are just like my husband.

112
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,720
But you're only alike.

113
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
Compared to him,

114
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
your inner strength is weak,

115
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
your breath faint

116
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,880
and you're much more fragile.

117
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
My hearing is sharp.

118
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,160
Whenever he came toward me,

119
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
I never knew when he was there

120
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
until he was right in front of me.

121
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
But you,

122
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,520
within five chi,

123
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,120
I can hear your breath and steps.

124
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Do you know

125
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,840
why I remember this so clearly?

126
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,120
Because I hate him very much.

127
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
Between the two of us

128
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,480
lies the deep grudge
between our families.

129
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
I once told him

130
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
if we ever met again,

131
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,080
it'd be kill or be killed.

132
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Tell me,

133
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,880
if he were standing before me right now,

134
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
what should I do?

135
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
You should kill him.

136
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,280
You're right.

137
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,960
If he were standing in front of me
right now,

138
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,680
I'd definitely kill him
with my own hands.

139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
You're not him.

140
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,040
Do you think

141
