[Episode 6]
[Fireworks Made of Ashes]

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,880
Last night, it was you
who took the initiative.

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,920
How come now

6
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,120
you refuse to acknowledge it?

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Miss, what's wrong?

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,800
You don't look well.

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,760
Lyuzhu,

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,280
do you think one's memory
can be falsified?

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Memory is based on personal experience.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
How could it be falsified?

13
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,280
Exactly.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,080
How could you falsify something
you've experienced?

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,080
I need to see the evidence.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Xiao Zhi.

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Tell me, under what circumstances

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,840
might one mistake another person
for someone else in their memories?

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,240
You should be more concerned
about your arm.

20
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,360
It's in terrible shape.

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,880
Tomorrow, there won't be any place
for you to cut.

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
Your wife has run off again.

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
Just assign someone
to protect her in secret.

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
This time you're not going
to chase after her?

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,200
No, I'm not.

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Let her meet whoever she wants.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Indeed,

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
all the assassins have been killed

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
and the woman is severely injured.

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,200
With the protection
of the Jade Pavilion,

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,760
the Empress won't be able to harm her.

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
What about the assassin you caught?

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,120
He's confessed.

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
Have him send a message

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
inviting the Empress

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
and the Crown Prince

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,280
to a meeting at the lake pavilion
on Peony Lake.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Yes.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,520
How should we deal with
the bodies of the assassins?

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Prepare a grand gift for them.

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,280
Did the Preceptor
give you a hard time last night?

42
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,560
No,

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
we just had a fight.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,000
What about you?

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,920
You went home late.

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
Did your father scold you?

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,560
Of course he did.

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,240
As punishment,

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,280
I have to copy The Book of Women
a hundred times.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
I'm truly sorry about that.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,440
A man may remarry

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,000
but a woman can't.

53
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Hmph!

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,240
What nonsense!

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
Why is it that men can remarry

56
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
but women can't?

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
What,

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,160
are you thinking of

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,040
divorcing the Preceptor

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
and marrying the Crown Prince?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
Perhaps it won't be a divorce.

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,120
I might be widowed instead.

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,920
Shush!

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
How can you even joke about that?

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Yue,

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,640

In the third month
of the 29th year of Tianyan,

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Inspector Na Cheng'an
was executed for treason.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
The entire Na family, all 48 members,

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,280
were massacred

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,960
and buried in the outskirts
of the capital.

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,520
Na Jinci died when
he was nine years old.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
Girls,

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
this is the grave you're looking for.

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,080
Good,

81
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,920
start digging.

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
The payment will be generous.

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,640
I'll take responsibility
for whatever happens.

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Alright.

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Yin,

86
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
what are you doing?

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
This is a graveyard.

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Some people are skilled
at manipulating life and death.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Those who are alive are declared dead

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,360
while those who are dead
are said to be alive.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,160
I don't believe a word he says.

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,240
I need solid evidence.

93
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Keep digging!

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
Girls,

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,800
we've reached it!

96
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,880
Oh no!

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
This family of three died so tragically.

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,360
Everything matches.

99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
Dongfang Zui,

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,560
you're indeed a liar.

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
Why did you bring me here?

102
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
Don't you want to know

103
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
who sent those assassins

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,120
yesterday?

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Chi,

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,040
that day,

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,520
you told me your grandfather
was killed by Dongfang Zui

108
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,440
and I didn't believe you.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
But now,

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,280
I must tell you the truth.

111
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
The truth?

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Back then,

113
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,560
Na Cheng'an married my half-sister.

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
But that wretched woman wasn't content.

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,480
After marrying the Inspector,

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,240
she seduced your father

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,800
and even

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,120
gave birth to a bastard child,

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
Na Jinci.

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,120
As he grew older, the boy resembled
your father more and more.

121
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
How could I tolerate that?

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,760
To protect your position
as the Crown Prince,

123
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,840
your grandfather personally

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
oversaw the execution

125
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,640
of the Na family.

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,720
What...

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
No wonder.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
No wonder.

129
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,120
That's why the Na family

130
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,000
vanished without a trace overnight.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Dongfang Zui...

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
Is he

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,720
Na Jinci?

134
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Indeed,

135
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
he's that bastard child
who carries the poison.

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
He somehow survived.

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,040
Don't you want to know

138
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,520
where yesterday's assassins

139
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,920
ended up?

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Where?

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,480
I let them go.

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,920
Let them go?

143
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,040
Why isn't he dead yet?

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
Didn't Man send assassins to kill him?

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
This was clearly meant as
an offering to the dead.

146
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That bastard.

147
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,480
The game begins.

148
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,480
The Preceptor dare not
mistreat the men you sent.

149
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,600
And now they've all been
sent back to you.

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,240
What does he mean?

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
He let them go?

152
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,040
Is he really that kind-hearted?

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,640
Where are they?

154
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,400
They

155
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,320
are up there.

156
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Are you saying,

157
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,320
he

158
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,520
burned them all

159
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,400
and set them off as fireworks?

160
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
What's he planning?

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
This

162
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,520
is his declaration of war.

163
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Yin,

164
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,360
back in Youzhou,

165
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,000
you said

166
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,040
you loved watching fireworks.

167
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,840
Enough!

168
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,720
Haven't you acted enough?

169
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
You've forced me into marriage.

170
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,680
Why do you pretend to be someone else?

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Do you find this amusing?

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
In front of you,

173
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm nothing but
a straightforward villain.

174
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Fabricating memories

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
and deceiving you?

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Such despicable tactics

177
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,080
are beneath me.

178
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Seeing is believing.

179
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,280
I trust only what I can see.

180
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,760
Yin,

181
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,040
how did Li Chi deceive you so thoroughly

182
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,880
that you trust him completely?

183
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,520
Isn't it you who's been deceiving me?

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
You present yourself as a noble,
upstanding man,

185
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
but behind the scenes,
you're a ruthless demon.

186
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
You've fooled everyone.

187
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,760
But if you want me to believe you,

188
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,800
you'll have to die first.

189
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,360
I may have deceived the entire world

192
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Have you ever considered

193
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,480
if the person

194
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,400
who killed with you in that temple
was truly the Crown Prince,

195
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,920
you wouldn't need

196
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,480
to wear the mask

197
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
of a noblewoman around him

198
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
and live so cautiously all these years?

199
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
Yue,

200
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,440
why are you here?

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Come sit.

202
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,480
I heard the situation
on the front line is tense,

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,480
so I came to invite you
to Yaoguang Temple

204
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
to pray for the Xie Army.

205
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,000
There's news from the front line?

206
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,920
As a member of the Xie family,

207
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,480
I don't even know what's going on
with the Xie Army.

208
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
Did someone send you a private message?

209
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
Keep your voice down.

210
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,680

211
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,720
that I've been exchanging
private letters

212
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,360
with a man,

213
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll have no choice but to prove
my innocence by death.

214
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,040
I only mentioned a letter.

215
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
I never said it was from a man.

216
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
Yue,

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,480
my brother told me before he left

218
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,480
when he returns victorious,

219
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,680
he'll ask His Majesty
for permission to marry.

220
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,640
I envy you and my brother.

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
You're childhood sweethearts

222

224
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,920
do you still

225
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,160
have feelings for His Highness?

226
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,280
I don't know.

227
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
I used to think

228
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
I loved His Highness.

229
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,720
And

230
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,560
I always presented myself
as a noblewoman in front of him,

231
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,920
trying to maintain the image
of a virtuous girl.

232
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
I never thought there was
anything wrong with that.

233
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,800
The Crown Prince is a good man

234
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,800
and being the Crown Princess
isn't a bad thing.

235
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
But lately, I've been wondering,

236
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,600
is this really the life I want?

237
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Have you ever considered

238
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
if the person

239
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
who killed with you in that temple
was truly the Crown Prince,

240
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,360

243
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes,

244
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
why should I?

245
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,040
The Preceptor changed your mind.

246
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,440
He made you realize

247
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
what true love is.

248
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,160
What does this have to do with him?

249
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Madam Xie,

250
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,640
it's time to take your medicine.

251
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,040
Why are you delivering
the medicine today?

252
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
The ingredients are extremely rare,

253
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
so I've taken it upon myself
to deliver them.

254
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,080
I can't entrust this task
to anyone else.

255
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,440
I meant,

256
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,600
the Preceptor usually delivers it.

257
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,920
Why don't I see him today?

258
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Well...

259
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,360
I'll go find him myself.

260
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Madam Xie,

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,400
I advise you not to provoke him.

262
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,560
Today is the anniversary
of his mother's death.

263
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,760
He's not in the mansion.

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
If you provoke him now,

265
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
it'll only bring him more sorrow.

266
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
Today is the anniversary
of his mother's death.

267
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,760
Then he must be at his old residence.

268
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,360
So this is the former Na Mansion.
