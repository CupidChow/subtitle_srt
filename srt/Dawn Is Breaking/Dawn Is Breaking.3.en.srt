00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
If you want to kill me,

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,040
you can just tell me.

6
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,880
Why go to such lengths?

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,880
You really are a lunatic.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
But there's no need to bluff.

I used the deadly poison

No matter how profound your skills are,

Is this all you're capable of?

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,960
Put me down!

Of course what a couple would do.

Kill me.

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Your deep hatred for the royal family

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,480
has nothing to do with me.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,600
But to humiliate me like this,

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
you might as well kill me.

42

and His Highness

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
the Duke was killed by the Preceptor.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm telling the truth.

75
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,960
Are you certain?

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm certain.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
I shot and killed the Duke with an arrow

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
right in front of my wife.

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,800
Moreover,

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
if you have any questions,
just ask me directly.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
Don't disturb my wife.

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
I'll take my leave.

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Wait.

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
I think

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,680
it was you who slapped my wife that day.

86
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
I was acting under the order
of Her Majesty.

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
Take her away.

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,440
First the Duke,

89
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
and now the nanny.

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,400
What is the Preceptor plotting?

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
No matter what,

92
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,760
there must be evidence for his actions.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
I must catch him in the act

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,600
and tell His Highness.

95
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Since I'm now the Preceptor's wife,

96
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,320
I should be allowed

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,360
to inspect his study.

98
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,680
Master,

99
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
if you don't go in now,

100
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Madam Xie might be in danger.

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,640
Go back.

102
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,640
Why are you in my study?

103
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,440
Let me guess.

104
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
You're trying to find evidence
against me,

105
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,970
aren't you?

106
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you want to know?

107
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,240
There's no need to go to such lengths.

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
I'll tell you everything.

109
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Fine.

110
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
Did you kill the Duke?

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Didn't you see it with your own eyes?

112
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Why did you kill him?

113
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
I killed the Duke

114
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
because I have a deep grudge
against the royal family.

115
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,240
Not just the Duke,

116
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,790
the Emperor,

117
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,360
the Empress,

118
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
and your Crown Prince,

119
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,400
none will escape.

120
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,800
Your senseless killing
will bring retribution

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
upon you one day.

122
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
I'll be waiting to collect your body.

123
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,790
Collect my body?

124
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,010
Master,

125
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,560
how is Madam Xie?

126
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
We were just having a chat.

127
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,640
She's probably asleep by now.

128
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
A chat?

129
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,400
It was rather noisy for just a chat.

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,520
She just told me

131
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
she wanted to collect my body.

132
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,400
Seems like

133
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,240
she's starting to think of me as family.

134
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,640
From what I can tell,

135
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,160
she wants you dead.

136
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
Really?

137
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,160
Is that what she meant?

138
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,960
I'll remember that.

139
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,960
I just took her pulse.

140
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,800
The poison in her is extremely hot,

141
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
which just so happens to counteract
the poison in you, Withering Summer.

142
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,800
If you want the antidote,

143
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm afraid

144
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
you'll have to use your blood

145
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,840
as a lead.

146
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,800
This method is too harmful to your body.

147
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,760
Forget it.

148
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,400
Is it enough?

149
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,160
Yes, of course.

150
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Master,

151
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,080
you only need to draw blood once a day.

152
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You need to

153
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,880
replenish yourself after this.

154
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,880
Prepare the medicine.

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,240
She doesn't like the smell of blood.

156
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Find a way

157
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,360
to mask the smell.

158
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,380
Master,

159
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
you've done so much for Madam Xie.

160
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,280
Why make her so angry and resentful?

161
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
I think

162
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,480
you should just tell her.

163
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,440
Maybe

164
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
she might even fall in love with you.

165
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,840
You're suggesting

166
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,360
I use kindness to demand repayment?

167
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,160
I won't stoop to the level
of those hypocrites,

168
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,280
pretending to be something I'm not

169
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
to win her heart.

170
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,240
Besides,

171
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,200
let me tell you.

172
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,280
My wife

173
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
is no ordinary lady.

174
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,160
Miss,

175
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,280
the Mid-Autumn Banquet
is the day after tomorrow.

176
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
Your parents and your brother

177
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,440
will all be there.

178
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,720
You'll finally get to see your family.

179
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,000
What are you two talking about

180
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,200
so happily?

181
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,000
We're discussing how to kill you.

182
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,520
Miss,

183
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
don't joke like that.

184
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Well, have you figured it out yet?

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,560
Seems like you haven't.

186
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,200
It's true.

187
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,680
I know all poisons,

188
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
so you can't poison me.

189
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,280
When it comes to skills,

190
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
yours are inferior to mine.

191
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,840
Killing me

192
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,880
is extremely hard.

193
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
Then may I ask, Preceptor,

194
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
if I wanted to kill you,

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,160
what method should I use?

196
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,560
Why don't I start

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,360
teaching you about poisons

198
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,760
and swordsmanship from today?

199
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,560
What do you think?

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,600
You're going to teach me

201
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,080
how to kill you?

202
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,560
Study hard.

203
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,640
Once you've mastered them,

204
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,800
you can kill your teacher.

205
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,880
If I study hard,

206
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
how long will it take to kill you?

207
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,660
Thirty years.

208
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,760
The medicine is on the table.

209
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,200
Remember to drink it.

210
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
Don't try any tricks.

211
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,880
Poison can't kill you,

212
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
so what if I use something
other than poison?

213
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,800
Lyuzhu,

214
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
write a letter for me

215
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,080
to my brother.

216
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,680
At the banquet,

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,800
have him bring me something.

218
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
Lyuzhu.

219
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,110
Lyuzhu!

220
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,440
Miss,

221
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,880
you're terrifying

222
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,360
when you're with the Preceptor.

223
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,600
[Mid-Autumn]

224
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,210
[Xie Tinghan]

225
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,920
The Mid-Autumn Lantern Lighting.

226
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,440
Light the lantern!

227
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,940
Wow!

228
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,650
Bravo!

229
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,570
Marquis!

230
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,320
Well done!

231
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,080
Marquis Xie,

232
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,520
[Jiang Mingyue]
remove your armor and enter the palace.

233
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,120
Miss Jiang,

234
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,520
it's time to attend the banquet.

235
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
This banquet is really excellent.

236
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Look at this wine. It's top quality.

237
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

238
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,880
General Xie, you lit the lantern.

239
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
His Majesty has bestowed you

240
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,760
a plate of mooncakes.

241
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

242
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,820
Loyal ministers,

243
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,560
today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,840
Let us raise our cups,

245
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,560
drink wine and admire the moon

246
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,900
as we celebrate this night together.

247
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,450
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
Miss Jiang over there

249
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
is my close friend.

250
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,600
I'm going to offer her a toast.

251
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,560
My dear sister-in-law,

252
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,440
it's been so long.

253
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,040
What's this place?

254
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
What does it matter?

256
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
It's going to happen
sooner or later anyway.

257
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
So, have you two decided?

258
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,520
When's the wedding?

259
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,400
I can't wait to become family with you.

260
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,200
You need to be more composed.

261
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,160
You're already married

262
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
yet you're still so reckless.

263
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,280
This mooncake looks
particularly delicious.

264
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,760
Can I have it?

265
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,840
Sure.

266
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,020
Eat more.

267
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,560
Stuff your mouth.

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,520
Forget it.

269
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I'd better not eat it.

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Someone might get upset.

271
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,840
You just have one.

272
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,560
You can have it.

273
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,440
Brother,

274
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
may you soon win your bride.

275
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,520
The thing you asked for.

276
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
I've heard

277
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,720
even a strong man

278
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
will be instantly paralyzed
if he drinks

279
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
this Fragrant Powder.

280
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Is that true?

281
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,080
Yes.

282
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
It's neither a poison

283
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
nor a drug.

284
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,440
Its use

285
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,160
is somewhat unsavory

286
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,960
and nearly impossible to guard.

287
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
That's exactly what I want.

288
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Why are you out here?

289
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,040
It's cold outside.

290
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
I brought some wine.

291
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,160
I heard from the servants

292
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
the pomegranate wine
served at this banquet

293
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
isn't just sweet and delicious,

294
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,160
but can also warm the body.

295
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,640
My dear,

296
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,880
you're quite in the mood today.

297
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,200
I know you're always
on guard against poison,

298
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,720
but there are other ways

299
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,080
to kill a person besides poison.

300
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
Interesting.

301
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,360
My dear,

302
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,040

303
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
