[Episode 20]
[Divorce]

4
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,080
Do you even know
who the person you love is?

5
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,960
You and Xie Wanyin

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,400
are doomed to a tragic end.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
I heard from Xiao Zhi

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,800
you sat on Liangwei Mountain
for an entire night.

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
I was telling Yue

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
her vengeance has been fulfilled

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,480
and the evildoer has met her end.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,920
Last night's moon was big and bright.

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,680
Yue must be very happy.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,480
The Empress drank poison

15
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,000
and died a painful death.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
Mother and son are estranged.

17
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,080
Abandon the pawn
to save the commander.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
I never expected Li Chi
to be so ruthless.

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
Now, the Great Yu

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
seems prosperous.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
But in truth, external threats
are like strong wind

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,880
and its roots have long been rotten.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
I fear

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
the downfall of the nation is imminent.

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,680
What about you?

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
Now that your vengeance is fulfilled,

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,440
are you happy?

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,600
It's too fast.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
Wouldn't it be better
now that success came quickly?

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,680
Starting tomorrow,

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
I still have many loose ends to tie up.

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,080
Don't wait for me.

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,080
Madam Xie,

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,800
the master is occupied
with important matters today

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
and is unable to see you.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What important matters?

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
He can't even see me?

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,360
Starting tomorrow,

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I still have many loose ends to tie up.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't wait for me.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
I know he's been troubled lately,

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,840
so I made sweet soup to calm his mind.

43
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,000
It won't take long.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,320
I won't be a bother.

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Madam Xie,

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,040
please don't make things
difficult for me.

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,160
It's cold.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,640
You should go back and rest.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
Tell him

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
I'll be waiting for him in the room.

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Lyuzhu,

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
have you seen the Preceptor?

53
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,000
No.

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Miss,

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,800
did you have a fight with the Preceptor?

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,840
Na Jinci,

57
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,360
what do you mean by this?

58
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Miss,

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
it's time to dress up.

60
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
We have to attend

61
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,880
Miss Jiang's memorial ceremony.

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,200
I need to retrieve Yue's
personal belongings.

63
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,360
What happened to you?

64
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Today is Consort Li's memorial ceremony.

65
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
I knew you'd come.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Your Highness, you look so different.

67
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,040
I hardly recognize you.

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,200
Yin,

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
everything happened before was my fault.

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,280
I've now repented.

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,400
Can you...

72
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,320
Can you forgive me?

73
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,320
What are you doing?

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Consort Li's death

75
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,560
must be related to my mother.

76
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
Now that

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
she's dead,

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm here to offer prayers on her behalf.

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
I hope she finds peace

80
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
and ascends to a better afterlife.

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
There's no need.

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,080
Yue would never accept
such a hypocritical apology.

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,440
Yin.

84
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,240
Yin.

85
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
Yin, don't go.

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,840
Given our childhood bond,

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,960
can't we at least be honest
with each other?

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
Be honest with each other?

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
You want me to be honest?

90
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
Have you ever truly treated me
with sincerity?

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,080
You know better than anyone

92
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,320
how that bond came about.

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Everything is just a lie.

94
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,640
I...

95
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
I did lie to you,

96
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,240
but I only wanted to be
with you forever.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
I may have lied to you,

98
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,160
but my feelings for you were sincere.

99
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,520
But what about Na Jinci?

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Sincere?

101
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
You've never been sincere.

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
How can you even compare to him?

103
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Yin,

104
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,720
all men are the same.

105
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,760
I wronged you,

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
but do you think Na Jinci
is a good person?

107
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,440
His motives for approaching you

108
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,840
are far more sinister than mine.

109
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
What nonsense are you spouting now?

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,400
Now the Empress is dead

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,480
and he's eliminated many court officials
as he wished.

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,080
Think about it.

113
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,440
Does he still treat you the same way?

114
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
To him,

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
being with you

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,680
might be more unbearable than death.

117
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Losing the position of Crown Prince
was your own doing.

118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Don't come to me with your madness.

119
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,960
Lyuzhu,

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,080
let's go.

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,400
If you don't believe me,

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,840
you can ask the elders in your clan.

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,400
Find out what really happened

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,000
between the Na family
and the Xie family years ago.

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,080
Xiao Zhi.

126
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,800
Madam Xie.

127
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,160
Where's Na Jinci?

128
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,240
Has he returned?

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
He's returned, hasn't he?

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,840
I'll find him.

131
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,640
Madam Xie.

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
The master said

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,160
he won't see you.

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Won't see me?

135
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
What dose that mean?

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,920
It means he doesn't want to see you,

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
nor does he want you to find him.

138
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
You know

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
you won't be able to find him

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,400
if he doesn't want to see you.

141
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
What happened?

142
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
You must know.

143
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
Tell me, please.

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
If nothing else works,

145
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,960
take me to see him secretly,

146
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,680
please?

147
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,520
Madam Xie,

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
don't make things difficult for me.

149
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,440
Miss.

150
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Madam Xie.

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
That's fine.

152
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
I won't trouble you.

153
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,760
Lyuzhu,

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,760
let's go home.

155
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
To the Xie Mansion.

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Uncle Li.

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,080
Miss.

158
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,960
Why have you returned

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,040
in such a hurry?

160
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
What exactly happened

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
between the Na family
and the Xie family back then?

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,520
I only know a little.

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Miss,

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,800
this morning,
when I was cleaning the study,

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,280
I found this box.

166
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,760
I've never seen it before.

167
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,760
[Confession Letter]

168
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,880
This...

169
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Do you recognize it?

170
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,000
Well...

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
Tell me!

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,240
This was written
by the late General Xie.

173
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,000
He intended to present it
to the Emperor.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
How did it end up here?

175
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Did grandfather really write this?

176
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,440
Yes.

177
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,950
[Confession Letter]

178
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,280
In my life,

179
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,920
I've fought in countless battles

180
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,320
and pacified the lands.

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
After decades in the military,

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I've prided myself
on being upright and honest

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,320
with a clear conscience.

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,560
Yet

185
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,680
I committed one mistake,

186
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,120
which haunts me to this day,

187
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,840
making me unable to rest in peace.

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,240
Lord Na once met with me

189
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,360
and I believe his loyalty.

190
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,080
He isn't a traitor
