4
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,520
Yin,

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,480
are you upset that I came late?

6
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,800
So, you're Dongfang Zui.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,240
The Crown Prince said you're
full of evil and forcibly married me.

8
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,800
He hasn't changed at all,

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,480
still using such lowly tricks.

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
You risked your life
to break into the palace

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
and take me
from the Crown Prince Mansion.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
What exactly are your intentions?

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,120
Yin,

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
I promised you

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,840
I wouldn't leave you.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Even if it's the depths of hell,

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
I'll break in

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,280
and fight our way out together.

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,640
Yin,

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,720
Li Chi confused your memory,

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
but in that critical moment

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
you still chose to believe me.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
I'm very happy.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
I don't believe what he says

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,360
and I don't believe what you say either.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
I want to recover

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,200
my own memory.

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Fine,

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
I'll be with you.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
This is...

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
The Preceptor Mansion,

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,320
our home.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
How could this be?

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
Was what Xiao Zhi said true?

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,680
Madam Xie,

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,080
here's the marriage certificate.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
Here's the dagger you used

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,960
to try to kill the master
on your wedding day.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,880
Here's the poison

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
you used to coat the dagger.

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
And this pomegranate wine

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,400
was laced with aphrodisiac.

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Wait,

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,080
why would I use this on him?

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720
To kill him, of course.

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
By the way,

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Madam Xie, do you remember these?

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
I did this to him too?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,320
You didn't.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
But the scars

51
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,880
were caused because of you.

52
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,680
Xiao Zhi.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,360
Yin,

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
have you remembered something?

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,200
If I married you,

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,480
why would I want to kill you?

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,880
You were already engaged to Li Chi.

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
It was I who forcibly married you.

59
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,000
You were defiled by that villain.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,400
You were so heartbroken,

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
washing your face with tears every day

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,240
and waiting for me to rescue you.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
He said I was humiliated by you

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,080
and had no way to escape.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
It's one thing to deceive you

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
but how did he deceive himself as well?

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
He doesn't know you at all.

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Rather break than bend.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
Even if it costs me my life,

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I'd never submit to humiliation.

71
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
I've always been sincere with you.

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,360
I never thought about,

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,080
nor would I dare

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
to humiliate you.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,440
My master never

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,200
had any disrespectful intentions
toward you.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
However...

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,200
Given what happened,

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
it's understandable you misunderstood.

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Xiao Zhi,

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
you may leave.

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
I'll take my leave now.

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Wait.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,560
Aside from the memory loss,

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
does Yin have any other injuries?

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,240
For now, it seems to be
only memory loss.

87
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,800
However, there might be
long-term effects.

88
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,640
But since I'm not skilled in this area,

89
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
we may need Ms. Ruolan's help.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,640
Go ahead.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,760
And then?

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
What do you mean?

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,840
What happened
after I failed to kill you?

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
And then

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,400
you fell in love with me.

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
Words alone aren't enough.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,120
I haven't regained my memory yet.
What are you doing?

99

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
so let's start over.

is much more to my taste.

There are many ways to make someone
lose their memory.

It's hard to investigate.

139
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Do you have any other clues?

140

If you ask me,

141
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
this is the second time
she's lost her memory.

142
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Twice?

143
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,560
Yes,

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
this time, she lost all her memories.

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
Last time,

146
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,760
certain fragments
of her memory were replaced.

147
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,560
Memory replacement?

148
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
That's quite unusual.

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,840
After your memory was replaced,

150
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
did your face show any changes?

151
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,400
I don't remember anything.

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Her face...

153
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
I remember

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,040
when she was young,

155
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,880
there was a red mole here.

156
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,840
Blood Reversing the Meridians.

157
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
Blood Reversing the Meridians?

158
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
I know what this is.

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
Master, look.

160
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
This is a secret art
from the Southern Regions,

161
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
where memories are sealed

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
or even altered using poison needles.

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
This art is extremely dangerous.

164
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
The first time, it causes
Blood Reversing the Meridians

165
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
and confusion in memory.

166
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,160
The second time results
in total memory loss.

167
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,160
If used a third time,

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,320
the person will become
a complete idiot.

169
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,080
How can this be undone?

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,040
First, suck out the poison needle

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,280
and then use acupuncture
to regulate the blood.

172
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
Master, what do you think?

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
I'll do it.

174
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,760
Don't worry.

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,600
My dear, I'll be very gentle.

176
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,800
I was just thinking,

177
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
am I trusting you

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
too easily?

179
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
If you were to harm me on purpose,

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,320
wouldn't I be putting my life
in your hands?

181
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
My dear, rest assured.

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,760
Even if it costs my life,

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
