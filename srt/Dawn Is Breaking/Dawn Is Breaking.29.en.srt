[Episode 29]
[Waiting For You In Hell]

4
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,520
Your Highness, bad news.

5
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
The prisoner in our mansion has escaped.

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Search the entire city.

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Kill him on sight.

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Yes.

9
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,600
What?

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,600
The Empress...

11
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,720
The late Empress's grave is haunted?

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Indeed.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Since the Emperor fell ill,

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
ghostly lights and shadows
have been seen

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,440
around the grave every night.

16
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,640
They say

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,840
it's the Empress's vengeful spirit...

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,440
Haunted?

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,040
seeking revenge.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,320
It started after the Emperor fell ill.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Is it...

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
I'll tell you.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
The seal...

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,160
The seal is hidden in a place

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,800
where you'll never find it.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
I see.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,440
Looks like I'll have to relocate

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,040
my mother's grave
before ascending the throne.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
In the 42nd year of Tianyan,

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,000
Crown Prince Li Chi ascended the throne

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
and appointed Xie Wanyin as the Empress.

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,320
I've waited

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
far too long for this day.

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,440
If it weren't for Na Jinci meddling,

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
we'd have been married long ago.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
But here we are,

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,000
after all this time.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Yin,

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
it seems

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
you were destined to be my Empress.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,160
Making a married woman your Empress?

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,360
The ancestors of Great Yu
would never allow it.

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,040
Great Yu is now mine.

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,520
If I want you to be the Empress,

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
who would dare to object?

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,760
I want you to know

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
only I can give you

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
the glory of ruling the world

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,560
as the Empress.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,480
Unfortunately,

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
this time, when you marry me,

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
the Preceptor won't be here
to witness it.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,880
I'd love for him to see

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
you become my Empress with his own eyes.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,840
Kneel.

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
The late Emperor has passed

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,640
and returned to the earth.

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Following the Emperor's final will,
Crown Prince Li Chi

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
ascends the throne.

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,760
Now, at this moment,

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,640
I solemnly declare
to the heavens and earth

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,960
he ascends the throne.

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,920
The new Emperor ascends the throne.

64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Present
the "Hundred Blessings" painting.

65
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,280
[Traitor Li Chi]

66
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,080
Li Chi is a traitor?

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,440
Traitor Li Chi

68
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,520
poisoned the late Emperor

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
and usurped the throne.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
He conspired with Dafeng

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,480
to besiege Zhangzhou.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Xie Wanyin!

73
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,080
Li Chi conspired with Dafeng's Khan.

74
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,120
His treasonous letters are right here.

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,280
Everyone, please take a look.

76
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
With such evidence,

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
why didn't you present it

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
before the late Emperor's death?

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,160
I was imprisoned by Li Chi

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,560
and unable

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,480
to reveal the evidence until now.

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,560
Had someone accused the Crown Prince
before the late Emperor's passing,

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,320
I, as the head of the Judicial Office
and commander of Imperial Guards,

84
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,240
would've been the first
to hold the Crown Prince accountable.

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
But now,

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
the late Emperor is gone

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
and the Crown Prince
has ascended the throne.

88
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Our duty

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,960
is to maintain the eternal peace

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,520
of the Li family's reign.

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,720
I congratulate Your Majesty
on ascending the throne.

92
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,640
Long live the Emperor!

93
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,720
Long live the Emperor!

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,160
Li Chi isn't my child!

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,680
Minister Jiang,

96
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,800
whose reign

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
are you maintaining?

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,320
Your Majesty, I...

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,600
You're still alive?

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
Thanks to you, Chi.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
I haven't died yet.

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Otherwise, how could I have
witnessed such a fine play?

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Xie Wanyin,

104
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,480
have you come to kill me?

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,280
I've already distracted the guards.

106
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,080
Time is short,

107
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,240
so I'll get straight to the point.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,400
Here is a pill that fakes your death.

109
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,560
Take it, and Your Majesty can escape.

110
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
Wait.

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,240
Write a decree of self-condemnation
in exchange for this pill.

112
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
In the 29th year of Tianyan,

113
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,560
the entire Na family perished

114
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,680
due to the Empress
and her father's framing

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
and your personal greed.

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,080
I want you to clear the name
of the Na family.

117
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Guards!

118
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Your Majesty, spare me!

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Without my order,

121
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
who dares touch him?

122
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Jiang Chenzhou,

123
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,440
you colluded with foreign powers

124
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
and plotted a rebellion.

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Drag him out, strip him of his rank
and execute him.

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Who dares lay a hand on him!

127
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,440
Let him go.

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,040
Let him go.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,160
Kill him now!

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,680
I said let him go!

131
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,880
Drag him out!

132
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Your Majesty!

133
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,480
Your Majesty, spare me!

134
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,000
Your Majesty, spare me!

135
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,880
Crown Prince Li Chi.

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm old now

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,920
and tend to be soft-hearted.

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,160
In consideration
of our father-son relationship...

139
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Father,

140
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,520
at a time like this,

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
you're still playing a loving father?

142
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,440
How ridiculous!

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,040
You don't actually think
I've lost, do you?

144
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
You...

145
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
Na Jinci, kill him!

146
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Don't forget,

147
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
you have a deep grudge against him.

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,560
Do you still need to hesitate
about who to choose?

149
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
You want me to kill the Emperor?

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
All the courtiers

151
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
and thousands of royal guards

152
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
would rise against me if I did.

153
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
Your plan is too clever by half.

154
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,760
But right now, the surest way to victory

155
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
is in my hands.

156
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Na Jinci,

157
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,280
I know you too well.

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Someone like you

159
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
will ultimately die
for that ridiculous love of yours.

160
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,560
But you don't know me well enough.

161
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
I'd rather die with honor

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,880
than survive in disgrace.

163
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
You're crazy!

164
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
I'd rather die

165
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,280
than betray my heart's desire.

166
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
He taught me that.

167
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Li Chi,

168
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
you've lost.

169
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,320
If everything

170
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,760
was already destined,

171
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,360
I'd rather die by your hand.

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,040
You don't deserve a peaceful death.

173
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll send you to hell

174
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,640
to suffer for a hundred lifetimes.

175
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
For the souls of the entire Xie family,

176
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,080
for Mingyue

177
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,200
and for Lyuzhu,

178
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,200
you'll atone for them forever.

179
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,720
This bracelet...

180
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,480
I intended to put it on you

181
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
with my own hands on our wedding night.

182
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
I ask nothing more

183
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,360
except

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
that you never forget me
in this lifetime.

185
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,600
In your dreams.

186
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,200
Xie Wanyin,

187
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
I want you to never forget me

188
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,240
for all your lifetimes.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
Na Jinci,

190
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,280
I'll be waiting for you

191
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,760
in hell.

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
Na Jinci!

193
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,000
Na Jinci.

194
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
These days, I've searched through
every medical text

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,040
and finally found the antidote
for Withering Summer.

196
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,760
But this antidote

197
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,040
requires an extremely rare herb
as a catalyst.

198
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Red Spiderwort.

199
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,760
Red Spiderwort?

200
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,360
It's almost impossible to find.

201
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
They say only Li Chi has it.

202
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Did

203
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,240
the bracelet contain...

204
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,080
It contains the essence
of Red Spiderwort.

205
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,720
But...

206
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,040
Isn't there even a glimmer of hope?

207
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,720
What if we grind the bracelet
into powder

208
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,000
and use it as the catalyst?

209
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,760
Or maybe...

210
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,440
maybe

211
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
we could dig up the soil

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
in front of the shrine?

213
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
It's too little.

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
I was too careless.

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,520
It's all my fault.

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,600
How could Li Chi not have a backup plan?

217
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,800
He had everything planned
from the start.

218
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
It's all my fault.

219
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,240
Yin.

220
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,600
You're awake.

221
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
Yin,

222
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
if you blame yourself,

223
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,000
aren't you falling into his trap?

224
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,080
But if I hadn't acted so impulsively

225
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
and accepted the bracelet...

226
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,240
If you had accepted it,

227
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,320
you would've become his rightful wife.

228
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,360
If you hadn't,

229
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
he wanted you to regret it

230
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,240
forever

231
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,920
and always remember him.

232
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,280
Even if I

233
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,280
die from the poison tomorrow,

234
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
I'd never use his antidote.

235
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Have you forgotten?

236
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
Your husband is a jealous man,

237
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
someone who holds grudges.

238
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,080
I want you

239
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
to think about me

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,840
completely

241
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,720
and at all times,

242
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,640
alright?

243
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,040
This scent is so familiar.

244
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
I've smelled it somewhere before.

245
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
That sachet...

246
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Yes, that's it.

247
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
It smells just like this.

248
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,040
It turns out Li Chi triggered
the poison in Madam Xie

249
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,480
using the Red Spiderwort.

250
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,840
Na Jinci,

251
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,120
did you hear that?

252
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,600
We're saved.

253
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,200
