[Episode 13]
[The Bait is Taken]

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Madam Xie has been taken away.

5
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,560
Punish me.

7
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Who did it?

8
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,280
I took the initiative

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,680
to order the Jade Pavilion
to act in full force.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
It's been confirmed

11
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,760
the Crown Prince abducted Madam Xie.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
He's set up a trap
at the Crown Prince Mansion,

13
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,080
likely intending

14
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
to lure us in.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
It's the Jade Pavilion's signal.

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a trap.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Yin,

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
you're awake.

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,440
I never thought you'd stoop so low

20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
by using an innocent beggar.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
In strategy, there's no right or wrong,

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
only winning or losing.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
This time,

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,240
you've lost.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,440
You killed her?

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
You wouldn't spare a child?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
She was just a beggar.

28
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
For a beggar to be killed
by the Crown Prince,

29
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
it's a fortune for her.

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Crown Prince?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,600
Are you worthy of the worship
and the position of the Crown Prince?

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
You're not even fit to be a human.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,520
You're nothing but an animal!

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,560
Yin, you've changed for the worse.

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,120
I don't like you

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
like this.

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
Once you return to the Eastern Palace,

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
you must adhere to proper conduct.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
You're dreaming.

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you trying to do?

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course,
to rekindle our old relationship

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
and rescue you

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,480
from Na Jinci.

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
You bit me!

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
You poisoned me.

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
It's my own fault for being blind

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,400
and deceived by a lunatic for so long.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Lunatic?

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,640
When it comes to that,

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,920
no one surpasses the Preceptor husband
of yours, Na Jinci.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, right,

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,280
he's a true illegitimate child

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280
and a monster plagued by poison.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
Shut up!

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
What's wrong?

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,080
Just a few words about him
and you're already hurting?

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Have you forgotten?

58
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,080
You and I were childhood sweethearts,

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
perfectly matched.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,760
If not for him stealing you away,

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,680
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

62
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,960
We could've been happy together.

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,520
Happy together?

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
Your so-called happiness

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
is controlling me with poison,

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
making me live
in your lies and manipulation.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Let me tell you.

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Even without him,

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
one day I'd have discovered the truth

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,400
and exposed your true nature!

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
Hahaha!

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,840
True nature?

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,840
What true nature?

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
Everything I did was for you.

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Yin,

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
is it wrong for me to love you?

77
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
I want to be with you forever

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
and make you mine.

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Is it wrong?

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Forget it.

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,200
You're hoping Na Jinci will come
to save you, aren't you?

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
Good.

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm waiting for him too.

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
When he arrives,

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,200
I'll make him watch as you and I

86
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,840
be happy together.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
Then,

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,400
you'll kill him with your own hands.

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,680
Impossible!

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
What are you doing?

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,480
What are you planning to do?

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
Shh.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
Don't be afraid, Yin.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,240
Soon, we can

95
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
start anew.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,160
Yin, you're awake.

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
You were scared just now, weren't you?

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,840
Where am I?

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Who are you?

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
You...

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
You don't remember?

102
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,080
It's me, your Crown Prince.

103
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
Crown Prince?

104
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,800
It's all that villain
Dongfang Zui's fault!

105
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
Dongfang Zui?

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
You're the beloved daughter of Duke Xie.

107
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
We grew up together
as childhood sweethearts.

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
We got engaged at 15

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,160
and the seventh lunar month this year,

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,520
we had our wedding at the Yu Temple
on Liangwei Mountain.

111
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,000
I do have some memory of that.

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,880
So after the wedding, I've been living
in the Crown Prince's mansion?

113
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
Later,

114
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,560
you were kidnapped by a villain
named Dongfang Zui.

115
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,000
For six months,

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
I tried every possible way

117
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,080
and only last night did I
get the chance to rescue you.

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,680
That villain must have mistreated you,

119
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
causing you so much distress

120
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,360
that you lost your memory.

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm the daughter of a duke

122
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,240
and you're the Crown Prince.

123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
How could that villain
have kidnapped me?

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
That villain is ambitious.

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
Hiding behind the title of Preceptor,

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
he bullied the weak
and flattered the powerful

127
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
to deceive His Majesty.

128
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
He used the excuse of divine will

129
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
to forcibly marry you.

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
A few days ago,

131
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,320
you sought my help to escape

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
and jumped into a lake
in the deep of autumn.

133
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm sorry,

134
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,360
but I can't remember anything.

135
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,600
It's alright.

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,920
Yin,

137
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,960
as long as you're still here,

138
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
as long as we're together,

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,720
it's OK if the past memories
are forgotten.

140
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll do it myself.

141
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,800
[Crown Prince Mansion]

142
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
Yin,

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,080
you've become much colder towards me.

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

145
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
My memory hasn't fully returned,

146
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,600
so I'm not quite used to this.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,840
You need to get used to it quickly.

148
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
You used to

149
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,920
call me Crown Prince.

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,600
What's that smell?

151
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
It might be the scent of plum blossoms.

152
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm your husband.

153
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
You're the only Crown Princess
I'll ever have.

154
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,680
For this life and the next,

155
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
I'll cherish you,

156
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
love you

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
and protect you with all my heart.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
Only I

159
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
can give you such happiness.

160
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
But as you said,

161
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I was already promised to that villain.

162
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,520
How can I still be the Crown Princess?

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
I have sworn

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,200
in this life,

165
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,040
you'll be my only wife.

166
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,920
But...

167
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,120
But?

168
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
But you...

169
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,360
you were defiled by that villain.

170
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,680
You were so heartbroken,

171
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,800
washing your face with tears every day

172
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
and waiting for me to rescue you.

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
Yin,

174
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,520
I couldn't protect you.

176
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,960
I was defiled by the villain,

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,560
washing my face with tears every day

178
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,720
and waiting for you to save me?

179
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,640
I risked my life to save you,

180
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,080
but you...

181
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
but you refused to marry me

182
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
because you lost your virginity.

183
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,520
So, I had to let you stay
in the Crown Prince Mansion

184
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,160
as a concubine in name.

185
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,880
Yin,

186
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
don't worry.

187
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,960
I'll never despise you.

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
You shouldn't belittle yourself
because of this experience.

189
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
In my eyes,

190
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
even if the jade has a flaw,

191
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
it's still peerless in the world.

192
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't be afraid,

193
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,360
Yin.

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,640
Try to accept me as you did before.

195
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
Love me.

196
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
Give me a child.

197
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Become my rightful Crown Princess.

198
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Assassin!

199
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
The bait is taken.

200
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,240
Who's there? Is that villain here?

201
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,200
Exactly.

202
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
If not him,

203
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
who would dare break into my mansion?

204
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Don't be afraid, Yin.

205
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm here.

206
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
I'll protect you.

207
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,520
If that villain humiliated me
in every possible way,

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,800
would I just sit there

209
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,720
crying every day

210
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,760
and waiting for someone to save me?

211
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm too late.

212
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
He's coming for me.

213
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Give me the dagger
so I can protect myself.

214
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,680
What nonsense!

215
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
You're a delicate girl.

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,920
Come on,

217
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,040
we'll fight our way out together.

218
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,960
You'll watch my back.

219
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
No way,

220
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
something's wrong.

221
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,520
My memory is gone,

222
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,920
but one's nature doesn't change.

223
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,720
If I truly loved the Crown Prince,

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
how could I be so caught up
in my virginity?

225
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,040
Kill him.

226
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
Show no mercy.

227
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,760
