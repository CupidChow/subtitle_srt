[Three days ago]

5
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,920
How are you feeling?

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,440
Feeling better?

7
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,600
I didn't tell you my itinerary.

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,960
How did you find me?

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Madam Xie left a secret note,

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
asking me to bring medicine here
to find you.

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
Did Madam Xie

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
stab you?

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes, she did.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Well, Madam Xie doesn't know
how to stab properly.

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
She should've stabbed the right side.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
What's the point of stabbing your left?

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
She had her own reasons

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
for hurting me.

19
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,760
You and Madam Xie

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
are truly ruthless.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,880
A match made in heaven.

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
Search the mountain immediately
under the order of His Highness.

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
Those are the Imperial Guards.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,280
Why are they

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
taking orders from Li Chi?

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
The Emperor is gravely ill

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,040
and the Crown Prince
is acting as a regent.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,960
If you delay your return any longer,

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,480
Li Chi will ascend the throne

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
and rule the entire nation.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Let's escape to the northern border.

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,440
Take the shortcut by water.

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,840
In less than three days,

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
you'll reach Jialan Pass.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,760
No.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,160
Li Chi must've thought of that too.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,920
Or rather,

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Yin would make sure
Li Chi thinks that way.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
I know a shortcut

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
which heads northwest

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
across the Liu River.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
It's faster than taking the land route
and leads directly to Jialan Pass.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Yin is truly formidable.

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
You arrange some men

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
to head north,

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
leaving deliberate traces along the way.

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,400
As for us,

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
we're going to go upstream.

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,760
Upstream?

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Today, Li Chi

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
has deployed all his troops
to search the mountain.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
We'll return,

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
storm the palace

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
and enter Andu.

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
Understood.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh,

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,720
by the way,

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
take a look at this.

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,580
[The Crown Prince's pulse is gentle]
[and strong. He has no illness.]

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,720
This is Li Chi's medical record.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,960
What's the problem?

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
After you left that day,

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
I read some medical books

65
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,280
and realized something was wrong.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
I then snuck into
the Crown Prince Mansion at night

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,320
and found this medical record.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,680
The Emperor has been taking elixirs
which have poisoned his blood.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,120
Every descendant of his

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,120
would bear that poison.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
So

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,280
why is Li Chi perfectly healthy?

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Because

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,760
Li Chi isn't the Emperor's son at all.

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,800
He's been sitting

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,200
on a stolen throne for too long.

77
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
Yin,

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,840
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
It was my arrogance

80
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,520
that caused so many misunderstandings

81
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
and brought disaster to your family.

82
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
The one who destroyed my family
was Li Chi.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,480
I'll kill him with my own hands.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
But how do you know all this

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
was caused by Li Chi?

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,040
I received a blood letter
from my brother.

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,280

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
After we parted on Liangwei Mountain,

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
he took Jiang Yan with him.

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
He cherished that child

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
more than his own life.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
If he knew

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
he had no way out,

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
why didn't he

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
mention the child in his blood letter?

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,960
That day outside Zhangzhou,

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,720
I only saw my brother's armor

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360

don't worry.

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Leave it to me.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,280
I promise I'd do my best

110

111

113

But if I hadn't done it,

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,480

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,520
I must

190
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,640
return to Andu alive

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
to uncover the truth.

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,840
My lord,

193
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,280
we've done a great service
for Yu this time.

194
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,840
Surely, he'll show
some sincerity, right?

195
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Of course.

196
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,080
He wouldn't dare go back on his word.

197
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,760
If he does, Dafeng will ensure
he meets a grisly end.

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,560
You're wise, my lord.

199
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Let's go.

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
We must reach the rendezvous point
within an hour.

201
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
Yes, my lord.

202
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
We've fulfilled Your Highness's order

203
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
by exterminating the entire Xie family.

204
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
When will Your Highness

205
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
fulfill your promise to us?

206
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
What I promised you

207
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,920
will be delivered.

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
It's Li Chi.

209
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,480
Who is it?

210
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,870
[Zhou]

211
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Hanxing,

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,080
back to Andu.

213
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
You said I killed your parents

214
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
and caused the deaths
of countless soldiers.

215
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
That's not all.

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,520
You probably don't know
how Jiang Mingyue died.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,680
It was me.

218
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I killed her.

219
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,280
I was the one who forced poison
down her throat.

220
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
Li Chi, I'll kill you!

221
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,760
I'll tear you to pieces!

222
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,800
You just won't listen.

223
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
Sooner or later, I'll find the child

224
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,840
and cut him to pieces in front of you.

225
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,120
You animal!

226
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,080
One day, I'll take your life!

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,120
Yin,

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,760
I don't want to leave you alone
to face him.

229
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,080
Come with me.

230
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,840
My brother might be in his hands.

231
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't leave.

232
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,040
I have my own way to save your brother.

233
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,640
But only if I stay in the palace

234
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,720
can I find a way to save the Emperor.

235
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Yin.

236
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Trust me.

237
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll act with caution

238
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,440
and won't confront him head-on.

239
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
If you're determined,

240
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,080
I'll leave some guards in the palace
to protect you.

241
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,280
Do whatever you need to do.

242
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
The day Li Chi ascends the throne

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
will be the day of his complete defeat.

244
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
The time has finally come to avenge
both my family and country.

245
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
I've waited too long for this day.

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
I must personally
settle the score with him.

247
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,800
Minister Jiang says

248
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,040
he's willing to select a noblewoman
from his clan

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,160
in exchange for 100 thousand troops
to help me ascend the throne.

250
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,360
I'll marry her as my Empress.

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,560
Will you consent?

252
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,480
I congratulate Your Highness
on finding a good match

253
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,560
and fulfilling your desires.

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,040
I forbid you to congratulate me.

255
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,520
Xie Wanyin,

256
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,840
do you think I did all this
just to ascend the throne?

257
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,880
What I've always wanted is you,

258
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,960
only you!

259
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
Anyone can congratulate me,

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
except you!

261
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,240
I'm unworthy of Your Highness's love.

262
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
From now on,

263
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,280
I wish you prosperity

264
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,600
with a beautiful wife
and many concubines.

265
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,920
No need to concern yourself
with me anymore.

266
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,840
Xie Wanyin,

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,720
because of you,

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,280
I killed my father and mother

269
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,760
and fought through blood
to carve out a path.

270
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,760
How can you be so indifferent?

271
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,680
I've suffered enough in love.

272
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,000
All I want in this life
is a single lantern

273
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,360
forever in the company of Buddha.

274
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,920
Even if you seek refuge with Buddha,

275
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
I'll keep you in the palace's temple.

276
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,280
Xie Wanyin,

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,080
you'll never escape from me

278
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,320
in this lifetime.
