[Episode 5]
[Kiss at the Cold Pool]

4
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,480
Why are you so sure

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
the child who saved you back then

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,320
was the Crown Prince?

7
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
I've known the Crown Prince
since we were young.

8
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,320
How could I possibly not recognize him?

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,480
How do you also have this poison?

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
Who exactly are you?

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,480
What do you want from me?

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
Yin,

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
let me finish one last thing.

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
Then you can do

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,480
whatever you want

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,480
with me.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
I must see His Highness

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
to understand what's truly going on.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
My dear, what a delightful mood
you're in.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
Have your wounds healed already?

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
From the way you speak,

22
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,480
it sounds like
you're a bit disappointed.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,360
You've suffered such severe injuries.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
You should rest a bit longer.

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,000
Yesterday, you almost got killed
at Liangwei Mountain.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
If I don't catch the killer

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
and give you an explanation,

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
won't you look down on me?

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,200
You've already found the killer?

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
There's a lead.

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
The Jade Pavilion

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,680
found a group of merchants
from the Southern Regions

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
at Fengheju in Peony Lake.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
I'll go with you.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
Are you worried about me?

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,880
After all, you got injured
because of me.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
I can't owe you the favor.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,880
We're a couple.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,120
How can you speak of owing each other?

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,200
Those people came to assassinate me.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I must find out why they want to kill me

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
and who they are.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,920
You can go,

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,960
but you must take this Scent Pill.

45
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,880
This pill won't affect your health.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
It'll just cause your body

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,880
to emit a unique scent

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,960
only my cranes can detect.

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,520
This way,

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
no matter where you go,

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520
I can find you.

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Are you happy now?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Alright.

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Tonight,

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll go with you to Fengheju

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,320
to drink wine and admire the moon.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,480
Lyuzhu,

58
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,000
go to the Jiang Mansion in the west city

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
and tell Miss Jiang,

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,520
tonight my husband and I
will visit Peony Lake.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,840
She loves lively events

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,600
and enjoys drinking.

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,160
If she has time,

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
ask her to bring a pot of Dragon Wine

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,560
and join me for a chat.

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,480
Alright.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,800
Tonight, I'll wait with Miss Jiang
in the private room

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,480
for my husband to catch the killer

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
and avenge me.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Alright.

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,360
What?

72
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,280
Yin wants to invite me to drink wine
and admire the moon?

73
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,080
Yes.

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,000
Miss Xie said you love lively events

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
and enjoy drinking.

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
She asks for your presence

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,600
with a pot of Dragon Wine.

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,840
Alright,

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
I see.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Please tell Miss Xie,

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,080
I'll fulfill her wish.

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Is Miss Xie out of her mind?

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
Miss Jiang,

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
you usually prefer quiet

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
and never drink wine.

86
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Why would she invite you to drink wine
and admire the moon?

87
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
It's a code between Yin and me.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,320
If she says something that's clearly
against common sense,

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
it means she's in trouble

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,960
and needs my help.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,720
What is Dragon Wine?

92
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
I've never heard of it.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
The hidden dragon lies in the abyss.

94
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
The dragon will soar
to the nine heavens.

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
The Dragon

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
means the Crown Prince.

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,760
Yin is in trouble

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,920
and is seeking help
from the Crown Prince.

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
Quickly deliver a message
to the Eastern Palace.

100
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
Yes.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
What should I do?

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
Yin is in trouble.

103
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,120
Yin.

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Your Highness,

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
His Majesty has ordered

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
you can't leave the palace
without a decree.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
Today,

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,320
you either let me out,

109
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
or

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,520
I'll spill blood here and now.

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
Let's see how you'll explain that
to His Majesty.

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Master,

113
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,880
as you ordered,

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
the marketplace has been sealed off,

115
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
the civilians have been evacuated

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
and the merchants
are being closely watched.

117
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
Alright,

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,800
proceed as planned.

119
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Yes.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
My dear, rest assured.

121
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
I'll avenge you
for yesterday's grievance.

122
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
Greetings to the Preceptor.

123
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
Stay here.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll go pick out a lantern for you.

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,760
Yue,

126
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,720
how is it?

127
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,520
This area has been sealed off
by the Preceptor's men.

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
He can't appear in person.

129
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,080
He's waiting for you in the pavilion
at the center of the lake.

130
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
Yin,

131
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,520
what are you trying to do?

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm scared to death.

133
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,640
This place is full
of the Preceptor's spies

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,360
and there are cranes
outside ready to report.

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
The Crown Prince has sent a message.

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,080
But the place is heavily guarded.

137
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
How will you escape?

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I have a plan.

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
These guards follow strict protocols

140
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
as precise as a sundial.

141
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,480
They perform their duties

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
without error.

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,320
However, anything taken to the extreme
can be counterproductive.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,560
When actions are carried out
with utmost precision,

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,880
it also implies

146
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,520
there's a constant potential
for oversight.

147
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,920
There are two guards at each corner
of the second floor of the private room,

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
rotating with the sun.

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
They change shifts
every half a stick of incense.

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,880
The Xie Army is stationed in Youzhou

151
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,800
with tens of thousands of soldiers
on the Suliang River.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Underwater

153
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,280
is my domain.

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
You want to control me with scent?

155
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
Let's see if that scent

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,680
can spread in the water.

157
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
Now!

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Wanyin!

159
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
Are you all here?

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highness.

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
If the pain is too much,

162
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
bite my hand.

163
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Your Highness, this is...

164
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,480
It's nothing.

165
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
As long as I can see you,

166
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
it's worth it.

167
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,400
This is nonsense.

168
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,720
Don't you know you're sensitive
to the chill?

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,560
Put this on.

170
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
If you had told me earlier
you planned to swim across,

171
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
I'd never have allowed it.

172
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
The Preceptor forced me
to take the Scent Pill.

173
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,640
To conceal my scent,

174
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
I had no choice but to come underwater.

175
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,840
In an emergency,
expediency is justified.

176
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,160
Please don't be angry.

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm not angry with you.

178
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm angry with myself

179
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
for letting you suffer.

180
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,080
It's all settled.

181
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I left one alive.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,920
It's just

183
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,600
the female leader didn't show up.

184
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,960
It's alright.

185
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,680
I know who she works for.

186
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,600
If it weren't
for that traitor Dongfang Zui,

187
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
I'd have already placed
the jade bracelet on you

188
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,280
and made you my wife.

189
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,400
We wouldn't need to meet

190
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,760
in such a manner.

191
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Why were you so eager to see me?

192
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Was yesterday the 16th
of the eighth month?

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,480
The 16th of the eighth month

194
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
and the day we first met as children.

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
I've been thinking about it too.

196
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,680
It's just

197
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,720
I've been overwhelmed
with affairs lately.

198
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,320
Now,

199
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,760
father suspects me of being involved
in the death of the Duke.

200
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,120
The Duke was your grandfather.

201
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
How could His Majesty suspect you?

202
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,000
That day,

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,880
you said you saw Dongfang Zui
kill the Duke.

204
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Are there any other witnesses?

205
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,120
I...

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,280
My wife truly lives up to her reputation

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
as a troublemaker.

208
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,600
Where is Yin?

209
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,560
Speak!

210
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,600
Yin

211
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
found it hard to bear the separation

212
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,880
and went to find you.

213
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,200
Found it hard to bear the separation?

214
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
It seems it wasn't me
she could bear to separate.

215
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
Where is the Crown Prince?

216
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,200
Speak!

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,760
The Crown Prince is in the palace.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,480
Let go of Yue.

219
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
You should go now.

220
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,480
Don't worry.

221
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm alright.

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,600
Go.

223
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
Do you even know your current condition?

224
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,080
I've spent so much effort
carefully treating you

225
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
but you risk it all just to see Li Chi.

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,080
You even swam in late autumn
to hide your scent.

227
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,080
You forcibly took what wasn't yours

228
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,360
but now you blame me for being ruthless?

229
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,120
If it weren't for your intervention,

230
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,280
seeing the Crown Prince wouldn't
have required such trouble.

231
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,960
What are you doing?

232
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Forcibly taking?

233
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
I'll show you what forcible taking
looks like right now.

234
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
Let go of me!

235
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,680
What are you doing?

236
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Let me go!

237
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,680
Yin, what's been going on
with you lately?

238
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,560
Don't even trust
your Crown Prince anymore?

239
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
Put me down!

240
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You animal!

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,840
I can see whoever I want.

242
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
Who are you to control me?

243
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Whoever you're thinking of,

244
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
I'll just kill them.

245
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,720
But you disregarded the danger

246
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
and recklessly jumped into the lake.

247
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,160
Fine.

248
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,600
Since you love water so much,

249
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,480
stay in it for a while!

250
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Let go of me!

251
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,000
Yin!

252
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,080
Let go!

253
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,920
Calm down.

254
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,360
Let go!

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,680
Yin!

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't move!

257
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,360
This is the medicinal pool.

258
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,320
It can cure all poisons.

259
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Just bear it for a moment.

260
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,320
Yin.

261
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,880
How are you feeling?

262
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Are you alright?

263
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,400

What's in this water?

267
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,640

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,400
Dongfang Zui,

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,920
who are you?

291
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,200
My real name is Na Jinci.

292
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm the only son
of Inspector Na Cheng'an.

293
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,920
The Inspector Na whose entire family

294
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
was massacred in the third month
of the 29th year of Tianyan?

295
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,280
The 29th year of Tianyan.

296
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
How old were you then?

297
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Nine years old.

298
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
After the massacre,

299
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,080
where did you go?

300
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,480
Youzhou.

301
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Where in Youzhou?

302
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
On the 16th of the eighth month,

303
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I was sheltering
in a ruined temple in Youzhou.

304
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
There was a huge Buddha statue
in the temple.

305
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
I had injured my right leg at that time.

306
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,120
The injury is on your leg.

307
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,160
There's no one in the wilderness.

308
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,880
I had no food or water.

309
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,680
Theoretically...

310
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,280
You wouldn't survive
more than three days.

311
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
I shouldn't have survived
more than three days.

312
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,680
If the pain is too much,

313
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,720
just bite me.

314
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
Get some rest.

315
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,920

316
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680

who took the initiative.
