00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,410
[Episode 18]
[Palace Coup]

4
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,680
How did it go?

5
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Everything is going smoothly.

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,320
The Empress
and the Crown Prince's faction

7
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
will surely be thrown into chaos.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Wei Su holds the military power.

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,960
If he becomes desperate,

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
he'll surely lead a rebellion.

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,320
The Emperor will soon go to
the Yu Temple for meditation.

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm not worried about them
not taking the bait.

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
Li Chi is a man of deep suspicion
and calculation.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm afraid he might just stay put

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,240
and let the Emperor die slowly.

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,640
Li Chi can wait,

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
but his subordinates may not be able to.

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,880
Even if Wei Su isn't enough,

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,680
we still have another move.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Wei Su's wife,

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,560
Princess Yunqi?

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
She's arrogant and haughty,

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
and has a close private relationship
with the Empress.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,600
But for the matters in the harem,

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,240
I need you to step in

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
and add fuel to the fire.

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,560
A person who is fierce but timid

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,520
is best handled.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,920
You just need to be more arrogant,

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
more domineering

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
and more unreasonable than she is.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,000
Hmm,

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,000
my wife

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
is indeed
the most domineering woman in Andu.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
What do you mean?

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,840
Being domineering is good.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
Domineering

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
suits me perfectly.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,320
You've seen the recent events

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,320
with your own eyes.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
What are your thoughts?

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,520
No matter how great Na Jinci is,

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,600
he's only temporarily
serving as a regent.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
The chaos he's created today

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
will eventually be repaid.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Just wait for the right moment.

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Wait?

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,240
You can wait,

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,680
but can your subordinates still wait?

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Wei Su has sent an urgent letter

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,880
stating if you continue
to stay in hiding,

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,480
their lives and property
will be at risk.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,080
Our years of hard work

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
can't be destroyed by the hand
of that illegitimate child.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,240
Mother, please calm down.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
The path to becoming Emperor

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,640
always requires deaths.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
These are the sacrifices
that come with it.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,680
Now,

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm the sole heir to the throne.

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,920
Victory depends only on waiting.

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
Before father passes away,

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,120
everything we do is risky.

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,400
Don't forget,

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,120
he

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
is also of royal blood.

68

[Confession Letter]

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,280
This is Wei Su's expression of loyalty.

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
[Confession Letter]
See for yourself.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Xie Chongyuan,

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
Xie Wanyin's grandfather?

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,280
It was the Xie family
who surrounded and killed

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,720
the Na family back then.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
That old man

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
didn't forget

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,960
to hand over the evidence
on his deathbed,

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
which was intercepted by Wei Su

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,440
and kept until today.

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Now,

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,520
we're in a difficult situation.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,080
No matter what,

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
the timing is not right.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
Mother, please don't act impulsively.

85
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
Everyone, come out!

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,760
How dare you be so arrogant
and domineering in the streets

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
but play dead in your own house?

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
Lyuzhu,

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,720
don't be rude.

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,600
Ah,

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,080
you're Xie Wanyin, right?

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
Why don't you kneel
and pay respects to me?

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,080
You're a princess

95
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
and so am I.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
By rank, we're on the same level.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Furthermore,

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
you're a general's wife

99
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,160
while your husband is merely
a third-rank martial officer.

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm the Preceptor's wife

101
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
and my husband

102
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,520
is now favored by His Majesty.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,360
If we really discuss it,

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,280
it's already an honor for you

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
to visit our Preceptor Mansion.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Honor?

107
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,480
It's an honor?

108
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,320
You, a daughter of a village boor,

109
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,640
dare to compare yourself with me?

110
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,840
My father is the dignified Prince Rong,

111
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
a legitimate royal family member

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,920
and could be honored
in the ancestral temple.

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
Your status is very esteemed

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,760
yet now you act like a village shrew,

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,120
making a scene in someone else's home.

116
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,840
If this gets to His Majesty,

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,640
it'll be a crime of negligence
of Prince Rong.

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
Shut up!

119
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
If it weren't for your vile actions

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,240
and excessive bullying,

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,280
would I even bother with

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
this wretched place?

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Besides,

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,400
what's your husband?

125
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,040
He's a mere regent.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,560
He thinks he can call the shots
and live without worry?

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,520
Pah!

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,600
Such brutality

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
will only lead to self-destruction

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,520
when the situation changes.

131
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't blame me for not warning you then.

132
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
Let's not talk about the future.

133
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Your Highness, you need to understand

134
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,640
who holds the power
in the current situation.

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
Someone who wants
to play the jackal to the tiger.

136
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
But the jackal

137
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
is likely to be the first to die
at the tiger's hands.

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,760
You wicked woman.

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Who are you calling a jackal?

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
You should go to hell
with your lunatic husband.

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Ouch!

142
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,440
This slap is to teach you
about humility.

143
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,040
This slap is to tell you

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,720
my husband

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,520
isn't someone you can criticize.

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,160
You...

147
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,440
You...

148
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Xie Wanyin, I...

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
Your Highness, if you still want
to be taught a lesson,

150
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll show you

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,920
what a general's daughter is truly like.

152
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,280
I don't mind telling you.

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Do you think you still have a way out?

154
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
Your husband is known
to be the Crown Prince's supporter.

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
But it's still uncertain

156
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
who will come to the throne.

157
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
You want to offer
a new bride to His Majesty?

158
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,840
How wicked you are, Xie Wanyin.

159
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
You...

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,440
Just wait for it.

161
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,160
I won't let you succeed.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,560
Well then,

163
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
I'll be watching.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Cousin, look at my face.

165
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,720
They're bullying me.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,560
You must stand up for me, cousin!

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,480
Useless.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
You're worthless.

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
Stop crying and whining.

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,560
That Emperor

171
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
really wants to take in a new bride?

172
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
It's absolutely true.

173
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,920
I think

174
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
this is their scheme, cousin.

175
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,240
If another illegitimate child is born,

176
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,920
Chi's position will be unstable.

177
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
The situation is in turmoil now.

178
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
I can't wait any longer.

179
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
I can't wait any longer.

180
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,760
Cousin, you're wise.

181
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
I need to plan carefully for Chi.

182
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,640
In the tenth lunar month
of the 40th year of Tianyan,

183
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,600
the Emperor is gravely ill
with insufficient defense.

184
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,920
The Empress and Wei Su
conspire to rebel.

185
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Don't move.

186
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Your Majesty.

187
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Wei Su,

188
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,200
you have a lot of nerve.

189
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you trying to rebel?

190
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,480
Your Majesty,

191
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,280
aren't you...

192
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
General Wei,

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
long time no see.

194
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,680
You came at just the right time.

195
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,480
Attack!

196
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
Dongfang Zui!

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
General Wei.

198
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,000
You lost

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
because of impatience.

200
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,210
[Wei Su's assassination failed.
The Emperor is fine. Make other plans.]

201
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,160
I, the criminal,

202
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,520
bow before Your Majesty.

203
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,360
May Your Majesty live long

204
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,080
and prosper.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
You're the Crown Prince.

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,520
How can you call yourself a criminal?

207
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
What crime do you have?

208
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,960
Today, as Your Majesty is ill,

209
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
I'm deeply

210
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
concerned

211
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,240
and have been praying day and night,

212
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,200
copying scriptures

213
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,280
and seeking blessings for Your Majesty.

214
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,400
Hearing about

215
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,880
the rebellion at the Yu Temple,

216
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm greatly worried.

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
So,

218
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,880
Wei Su attempted

219
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,840
to kill me and rebel.

220
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
You had no knowledge of this?

221
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
I truly had no knowledge.

222
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
I thought so.

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,400
How could the Crown Prince be aware?

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,480
I see.

225
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
You didn't know?

226
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
You didn't know?

227
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,880
You didn't know!

228
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,920
At this point,

229
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,120
you still dare to make excuses?

230
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Father.

231
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,680
You animal! How could you not know?

232
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,160
How could you not know!

233
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Father!

234
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Father!

235
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,480
I truly didn't know.

236
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,240
But this matter is indeed because
of my mother's confusion

237
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,880
and also

238
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,040
of mine.

239
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
I'll

240
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
remove my crown as a punishment.

241
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,600
I demote myself to a commoner

242
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
and I ask Your Majesty
to assign a punishment.

243
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,760
I dare not

244
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
call Your Majesty father again.

245
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Father!

246
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm sincere, which can be witnessed
by the heavens and earth.

247
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,320
As for the crime of treason

248
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,400
and the evidence of disloyalty
and unfilial conduct,

249
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,520
I'd rather die a thousand times

250
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,000
to prove my innocence.

251
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
Our Great Yu has only one Crown Prince.

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Isn't this inappropriate?

253
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
Consort Li's son hasn't yet been born.

254
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,600
Your Majesty,

255
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,400
His Highness has always
held deep respect for Your Majesty.

256
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,960
He even blocked a sword
with his own body for you.

257
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,760
How could he

258
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,880
commit such a foolish act?

259
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,440
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

260
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,480
I wish to offer a suggestion.

261
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,800
After all, His Highness
is Your Majesty's son.

262
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,920
Such filial piety and righteousness
can't be severed.

263
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,040
Father.

264
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
The Empress, Lin,

265
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,720
has conspired to rebel

266
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
with clear evidence.

267
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,840
Execute her

268
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
immediately.

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
Father.

270
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,680
Crown Prince Li Chi

271
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,520
should wait for my verdict.
