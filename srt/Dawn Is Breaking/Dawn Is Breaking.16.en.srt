Miss Jiang was so terrified

101

that she almost gave birth prematurely.

102

The poison in the baby
has invaded her body.

How did Yue's child

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,520
get poisoned?

105
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
The Emperor consumed too many elixirs

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
over the years and it accumulated.

107
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,640
Yin,

108
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
After Li Chi's fierce attack
on the Moon Pavilion,

110
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
the survivors all went into hiding,

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,040
so news from the palace
couldn't get out.

112
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,520
Does my brother know?

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,400
Yes.

114
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
Xiao Zhi went to find him.

115
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,360

116
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,480

I'm sorry.

121
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,480
I've dragged you all down.

122
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm the one who should apologize.

123
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,840
I shouldn't have listened to you
when you said those things.

124
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,800
I should've knocked you out

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,560
and taken you away.

126
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,840
I shouldn't have left you in the palace.

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,600
Those words I said that day
hurt you, didn't they?

128
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
Yin,

129
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,760
in fact,

130
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,800
there's something I've never told you.

131
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Sometimes,

132
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm really envious of you.

133
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Envious that you have

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,880
the love of your parents

135
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,040
and the protection of your brother,

136
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,200
so you can be fearless.

137
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,800
Yue,

138
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,120
you don't have to be afraid
of anything either.

139
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,560
I promise,

140
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,840
from now on,
I won't let anyone bully you.

141
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,080
You need to live on.

142
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
Do you hear me?

143
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
You'll be fine, do you know that?

144
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
You've already done

145
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,560
enough for me.

146
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,880
It's my own fault for being too weak.

147
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
I thought

148
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,800
as long as...

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
as long as I

150
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
obeyed

151
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
and submitted,

152
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
they'd leave me alone.

153
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,720
I was wrong.

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
The more I submitted,

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,080
the more they become unscrupulous.

156
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Yue.

157
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
Yue.

158
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Yue, does it hurt?

159
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,800
I've lived my life

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,560
cautiously,

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,320
never doing anything wrong.

162
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
And yet

163
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,040
I've ended up like this.

164
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,360
This is not the end.

165
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,040
Yue, listen to me.

166
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,720
My brother is on his way.

167
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,040
Just wait for him.

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,480
Wait for him.

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,560
Ms. Ruolan.

170
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,760
Ms. Ruolan,

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,480
I beg you, please help her!

172
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,000
Yin.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,960
She's only 19.

174
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,720
Her life is just beginning.

175
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,240
Ms. Ruolan, I beg you, please help her!

176

has already invaded her.

177
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,640

178
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,600
but this girl's life is beyond saving.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960

187
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
to ride horses

188
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,600
and see the moon beyond the Great Wall.

189
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
Promise me,

190
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,840
don't die!

191

Yin,

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
calm down and listen to me.

197
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
I can use my inner strength
to keep her alive for a while

198
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,760
so that the baby can be delivered.

199
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,840
