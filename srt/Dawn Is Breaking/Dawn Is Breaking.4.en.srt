00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,100
This time,

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
have I found the right place?

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I'd rather die by your hand,

7
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
but what do we do?

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,360
It seems someone is watching.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,880
You could very well

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,920
kill me in front of him

11
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,960
and return to his side.

12
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
But, Yin,

13
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,880
will your Crown Prince

14
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,120
accept you if you're stained with blood?

15
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,460
You...

16
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,120
I like it

17
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,080
when you're vengeful.

18
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Admit it, Yin.

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,920
You and I

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
are the same kind of people.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Yin.

22
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,700
Yin,

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,880
how are you doing?

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,680
After that day,

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
I tried everything to see you,

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
but I couldn't defy father's order.

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
I couldn't protect you

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,920
and made you...

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,680
and made you suffer.

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Your Highness,

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,520
in plain sight,

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
your concern for my wife
is very improper,

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,720
isn't it?

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
My wife and I live in harmony.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
I respect her and protect her.

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,080
How could she suffer?

37
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
If you truly respect her,

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
how could you act so recklessly
within the royal palace?

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
What were you

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
doing just now?

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
Didn't you see?

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,400

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280

urgent news from Zhangzhou.

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Over 100 thousand Dafeng troops
are stationed in Zhangzhou.

We urgently need reinforcements.

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,760

64

I thank you, Your Majesty.

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,770

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
Xie Wanyin,

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,240
come here.

84
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,040
Let me have a good look at you.

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
I remember holding you

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,200
when you were little.

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
I recall you practiced martial arts
from a young age,

88
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,040
aspiring to become a female general

89
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,480
to fight on the battlefield.

90
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,480
So,

91
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,120
why have you grown

92
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,860
into a noble lady?

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,840
When I was young,

94
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
I was kidnapped in Youzhou

95
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,360
and injured my right arm.

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I was fortunate the Crown Prince
saved me,

97
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,240
but it damaged my foundation

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
and I could no longer
practice martial arts.

99
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,750
What a shame.

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,510
What a shame.

101
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
How did this happen?

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,160
When did the Crown Prince go to Youzhou?

103
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,060
How come I didn't know?

104
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,120
So,

105
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
did you administer

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
the medicine this month?

107
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,070
Yes.

108
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,520
It's been added to His Majesty's
daily medicinal diet.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,270
There shouldn't be any issues.

110
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,020
But...

111
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,050
But what?

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm sorry, nanny.

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
I didn't mean to.

114
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,880
Useless!

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Miss Xie didn't ask questions.

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,120
Maids usually carry various types
of scented powders

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,960
so it shouldn't seem suspicious.

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
This matter is serious.

120
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,110
It's better to kill the wrong person

121
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,330
than let them go.

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,800
Do I still need to teach you this?

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,830
Yes.

124
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,840
I'll take care of it.

125
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,120
If you fail,

126
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,110
bring me your head.

127
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,530
Yes.

128
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,960
Miss Xie.

129
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,620
It's Miss Xie again!

130
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,920
What trick is this now?

131
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Today is the 16th day of the month.

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
The master has his monthly fast
and secluded meditation.

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
He needs to soak in the medicinal pool

134
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
for careful recuperation.

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
You came for your father's expedition,
aren't you?

136
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,160
Yes.

137
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,640
I want to send my family off.

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm in seclusion today

139
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
so I can't come with you.

140
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Take care.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Why is he so weak today?

Isn't she just going
to Liangwei Mountain

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
to offer sacrifices
before the expedition?

148
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
Is it that dangerous?

149
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,280
Fine.

150
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I'll follow your order.

151
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
When did the Crown Prince
go to Youzhou?

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,880
How come I didn't know?

153

Coachman.

154
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,990
Coachman?

155
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,680
Master,

156
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,960
it's a distress signal
from Jade Pavilion,

157
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,880
coming from Liangwei Mountain.

158
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Yin is in trouble!

159
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,000
Master,

160
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
your poison is flaring up today.

161
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,420
You mustn't act rashly.

162
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Master,

163
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,760
if the Withering Summer flares up,

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
it could cause your body
to explode and perish.

165
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
Please think twice.

166
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,600
What a ruthless little girl.

167
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,200
I've used this move for years

168
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
and you're the first to dare
stab yourself in the throat.

169

Who are you?

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,120
Why are you trying to kill me?

171
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,680
Ask in the underworld!

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
Hide behind me.

173
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,720

Your Majesty,

195
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,520
bad news.

196
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
What is it?

197
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,480
Why are you so flustered?

198
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,280
That child,

199
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
that cursed child poisoned from birth

200
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,920
is still alive.

201
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,620
Who?

202
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,520
Na Jinci!

203
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,280
Should I call you father

204
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
or Duke?

205
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,280
What crime have I committed
that warrants such deadly force

206
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,280
from the Duke,

207
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
my own father,

208
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,800
and Her Majesty the Empress,

209
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
my elder sister,

210
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,440
against my entire family?

211
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,600
Why?

212
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,600
You know full well.

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,800
I just want to live.

214
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,640
I want my child to live.

215
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,200
What have I done wrong?

216
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,210
Fine.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,800
My entire Na household

218
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
of over 40 people

219
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
have all been executed

220
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,400
today.

221
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Are you...

222
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you all satisfied now?

223
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,560
From now on,

224
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,680
my lonely soul

225
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
will pray every day

226
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,120
not to enter reincarnation.

227
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,080
I curse you all

228
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
to die without peace.

229
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,600
How can that be?

230
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,640
The entire Na family was wiped out.

231
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,340
Father personally supervised
the execution.

232
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,280
No one was left alive.

233
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,080
How could Na Jinci still be alive?

234
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,920
Impossible!

235
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,200
That's impossible!

236
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

237
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,240
The State Preceptor, Dongfang Zui,

238
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,600
is Na Jinci.

239
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,560
What?

240
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,240
Yin,

241
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,760
on the 16th day of every month,

242
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,720
the poison in my body flares up.

243
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,240
If you want to kill me,

244
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,240
now is the best time.

245
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,240
When did you get this poison?

246
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,320
This poison is called Withering Summer.

247
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
He's had it since he was born.

248
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,720
Go on, torment yourself.

249
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
One day, you'll torment yourself
to death

250
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,790
and I'll be glad to regain my freedom.

251
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,280
You said the Crown Prince saved you.

252
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,480
When did that happen?

253
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,880
It was on the 16th day
of the eighth month

254
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
in the 29th year of Tianyan
in Youzhou.

255
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Hurry up and do it!

256
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,000
Why are you so sure

257
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,320
the child who saved you back then

258
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,840
