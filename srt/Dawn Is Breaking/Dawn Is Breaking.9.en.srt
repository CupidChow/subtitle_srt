00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,560
Madam Xie,

5
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,640
please wait!

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Madam Xie,

7
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,200
my master forbade anyone
from telling you the truth,

8
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,640
but I can't bear to watch

9
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
you two torment each other any longer.

10
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,680
Today,

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,280
even if it costs me my life,

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,880
I'll tell you.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,040
Madam Xie,

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
please follow me.

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,280
Madam Xie,

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,360
we've arrived.

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,520
Madam Xie.

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,640
Is it blood?

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
Exactly.

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
It's my master's blood.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
How did you think your poison

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
was cured?

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
From the moment you two reunited,

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,680
my master noticed the poison

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
had already reached
your internal organs.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,920
However,

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,600
the timing of your reunion was wrong.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,240
You neither trusted him

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
nor recognized him.

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,640
He had no choice but to forcibly
bring you to the mansion

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,440
disregarding your wish,

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
in order to detoxify you.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Detoxify with blood?

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,080
Indeed.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
The medicine you drink daily

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
is made from my master's blood.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
His left arm no longer

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
has any space left to cut.

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
If he wanted to poison you,

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,160
why would he go to such lengths?

41
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Why didn't he tell me the truth?

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
Why did he deliberately hide it from me?

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
Does he think he's so great

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,640
by sacrificing himself

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
while keeping others in the dark?

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
My master has been poisoned
since childhood,

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
leaving his emotions incomplete.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
He fears if he tells you,

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,320
it'll come off as him
using this to demand repayment.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,720
He's afraid

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,480
you'd be swayed by gratitude.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,600
This will constantly pressuring you

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,680
to weigh the pros and cons,

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,680
forcing you to make choices
against your true desires.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,920
My master

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
only hopes you can be true to yourself.

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
He doesn't want you

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
to care about his feelings

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,600
or even

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,880
his life or death.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Today, he sacrificed half
of his blood to save you,

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
which is akin

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,920
to exchanging his life for yours.

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
What's this?

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,600
What's this?

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,360
Since you have the time
to have wild thoughts,

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
why don't you try to remember

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,840
when you started
having strange symptoms?

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,480

Your Majesty,

135
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
please let go of me.

136
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,240
Your Majesty.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,960
I've long been fed up with the Empress's

domineering ways

139
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,920
and the schemes of the harem.

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840

nor attention-seeking

144

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
It pleases me greatly.

Your Majesty,

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm but a lowly seamstress

148
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
and unworthy of such praise.

149
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,440
If I wish it,

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,200

a maid any longer.

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,360
You don't want the royal grace?

153
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,200
Are you still thinking
about Xie Tinghan?

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
Do you think you've hidden it well?

155
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,720
Once you enter the palace,
you're my woman.

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,280
If you have any improper thoughts,

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,680
I'll make you wish you were dead.

158
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
Xie Tinghan is just a general.

159

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
What now?

161
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Weren't you just playing a chaste woman?

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,200

I've lost interest after this drama.

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
In many battles generals die.

167
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,680
Perhaps Zhangzhou needs
a young general to die heroically

168
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
to boost morale.
