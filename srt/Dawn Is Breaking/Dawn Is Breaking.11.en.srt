storm that palace

189
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
and kill them all.

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,000
Then are you willing

191
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
to risk your life for her?

192
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
If it means her freedom,

193
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,200
I fear no death.

194
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,280
Good.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,480
There are spies in the Jade Pavilion
within the palace.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
Rescuing her won't be difficult.

197
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,760
We just need to wait
for the right moment.

198
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,800
When the time comes,

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll swap her out

200
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,520
and give her a new face.

201
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,520
You two can then

202
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,520
live far away at the border

203
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,480
and never return to Andu.

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,560
What if something goes wrong?

205
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,320
If I flee,

206
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,120
what...

207
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
what will happen to the Xie family?

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
As long as I'm here,

209
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
no one will dare touch the Xie family.

210
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,720
Don't worry, Tinghan.

211
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,280
I'll find a way to enter the palace

212
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,680
and explain everything to Yue.

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600
Good.

214
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
I'll wait outside the door.

215
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,960
Yue.

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,920
Here,

217
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
everyone calls me Consort Li.

218
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
There's no more Mingyue.

219
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,560
Yue,

220
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,280
my brother has returned.

221
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,720
We're going to take you out.

222
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,160
Tinghan...

223
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Tinghan has returned to Andu?

224
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
Is he hurt?

225
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,680
He's fine.

226
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,480
He's just very worried about you.

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,800
As long as he's fine...

228
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,840
As long as he's fine.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Yue, we've thought of a plan.

230
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,800
No, it's too risky.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,040
We must try even if it's risky.

232
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
How can we just stand by

233
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
and watch you waste away in this palace?

234
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,320
What difference does it make?

235
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,600
My whole life has been

236
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,880
moving from one walled place to another.

237
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm used to it by now.

238
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,440
Then get used to a new life.

239
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,440
Yue, I promise you,

240
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,040
it'll be safe,

241
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,120
completely safe.

242
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
As long as you can escape Andu,

243
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,880
you and my brother...

244
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,560
Yin,

245
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,120
there's no future

246
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,200
for me and Tinghan anymore.

247
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,080
Is it because you're carrying
the Emperor's child?

248
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
You were forced.

249
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,640
We all know that.

250
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,560
My brother said

251
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,160
he doesn't care.

252
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,080
I do.

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Yue,

254
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,840
we all want you to be safe.

255
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,680
Yin,

256
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
don't you understand?

257
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,520
The only way I can be safe

258
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
is if I fulfill my role as Consort Li

259
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
and bear the Emperor's heir.

260
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,840
