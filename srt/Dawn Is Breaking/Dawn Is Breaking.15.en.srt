Ms. Ruolan already said

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,800
you need to rest quietly
for three months.

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,760
Yet you're here catching the wind.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
What if it leaves aftereffects

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,560
and you become a fool?

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,520
It'd be perfect if I became a fool.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
Then you could take me
beyond the Great Wall.

11

16

didn't I ruin your lantern?

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Well, since you ruined my lantern,

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520

That year, I had a raging fever.

60

you were gone.

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240

71
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
and called my parents over

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600

73
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,200

in the world.

74

I want them to have what they want,

82

to be in danger.

I'll be by your side.

91
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,480
I'll go heat up some wine

92
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,200
and we can drink
and enjoy the moon together.

93
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,760
How does that sound?

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
Where do you keep the wine?

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,040
I want some pomegranate wine.

96
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
If you keep indulging like this,

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,920
it'll eventually flare up big time.

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360

106
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,520
What's the use of being imposing?

107
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,840
He's just a gatekeeper here.

108
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
What's that called?

109
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,360

110
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240

114
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,200
Guarding the palace gates
is really unsuitable.

115

I'm serious.

152
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
Should I pretend

153
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,880
I haven't regained my memory

154
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560

my stab

157
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
must have broken at least
two of his ribs.

Whatever Your Majesty wishes.

187
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,880
Where should we go for a walk?

188
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Hmm.

189
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I think we should go to Xuande Gate.

190
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,680
There's a warm pavilion there,

191
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,520
open on all sides

192
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,480
and warm as spring.

193
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
You and I

194
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,680
can watch

195
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,520
the fireworks there

196
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,560
and enjoy romantic moments together.

197
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,560
Isn't that great?

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,360
Your Majesty...

199
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,760
What?

200
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,440
You don't want to?

201
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm deeply grateful

202
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,280
for Your Majesty's favor.

203
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,520
Your Majesty?

204
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,280
What's wrong?

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
The Emperor

206
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
doesn't seem well.
