00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,120
Whether it was an accident
or deliberate,

78
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
let me investigate it first.

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
That fire...

80
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
That fire was definitely suspicious.

81
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
They killed Yue.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,520
I won't let them get away with it.

83
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,040

86
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,320

87
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,600
Who's the killer?

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
Everyone in that palace

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,320
is guilty.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,960
I'll make them all

91
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960

92
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,880

93
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't stop me!

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
Tinghan,

96
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,600
you're going to storm the palace
alone with a sword.

97
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
What chance do you have of success?

98
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,760
The Imperial Guards will kill you
outside the palace gate,

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
leaving your body in pieces

100
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
and your reputation will be ruined.

101
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,520
Is that what you want her to see?

102
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Then what should I do?

103
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,480
What should I do?

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
Why...

105
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,880
Why did they have to treat her this way?

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,840
We didn't ask for being together,

107
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,600
just peace.

108
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Was that too much to ask?

109
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
Yue,

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
I'll take you home.

111
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,080
How's my father doing?

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
The imperial kitchen reports,

113
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
His Majesty hasn't eaten in three days.

114
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,040
Good.

115
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
The fire that burned down Moon Tower

116
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,080
was quite fierce.

117
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,800
Have they found Consort Li's body?

118
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
They have.

119
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
Your Highness, rest assured.

120
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
We were very thorough.

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
No one will know

122
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
it was Your Highness who...

123
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
Jade Pavilion has been heavily damaged.

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,040
They can't stir up much trouble.

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
What about Xie Tinghan?

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
After the fire at Moon Tower,

127
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
he took a few days off

128
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,680
saying he was unfit for duty.

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,680
Recently, he requested to return
to the battlefield in Zhangzhou.

130
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,680
Should we let him go?

131
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Please advise, Your Highness.

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,880
Let him go.

133
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,520
In the future, when Na Jinci confesses,

134
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll need the Xie family
to help defend the borders.

135
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Leave a bloodline

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
for the Xie family.

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
That

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,520
will fulfill my wish.

139
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Take care of yourself

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,520
on your way to the frontier.

141
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
As for the baby...

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Yue is gone,

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
leaving only this child.

144
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,040
He's my only reason to live.

145
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,120
I must protect him with my life.

146
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,560
It's a shame

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,480
Yue didn't get the chance to name him.

148
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,640
He's the continuation of Yue's life.

149
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,320
Let's name him

150
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Jiang Yan.

151
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,680
Tinghan,

152
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
these are pills prepared by Xiao Zhi.

153
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
Dissolve them in warm water

154
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
and give them to him

155
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,680
when his poison flares up each month.

156
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,760
Yah!

157
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,480
The frontier is cold

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,680
and full of danger.

159
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
This child was born prematurely.

160
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
He's so innocent.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
If you're worried,

162
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,920
leave the child in Andu.

163
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
I'll find someone to raise him.

164
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,240
My brother said

165
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
he'd protect him with his life.

166
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
He'll keep him safe.

167
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,840
This world is too cruel.

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
I don't like it.

169
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,480
If you don't like it,

170
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,400
I'll destroy it for you.

171
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
I don't believe Yue's death
was an accident.

172
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
I'll seek justice for her.

173
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,960
When Jade Pavilion's people
retrieved her,

174
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
they told me

175
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,920
there was a scent of ambergris on her.

176
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,880
But the Emperor has been ill lately

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,400
and hasn't visited Moon Tower
for a long time.

178
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,160
It couldn't have been the Emperor.

179
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,400
Yue was about to give birth.

180
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,120
What reason would he have to harm her?

181
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,640
Ambergris...

182
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,760
The Emperor only gave it to one person.

183
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,400
You mean

184
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,360
Li Chi?

185
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
Na Jinci,

186
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,200
let's become rebels together.

187
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,960
Let's overthrow the Li family's dynasty.

188
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
Rebels

189
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
will be written into history books.

190
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,760
All the better.

191
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Our names will be linked together

192
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,080
for generations to come.

193
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,360
Good.

194
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,320
From this day on,

195
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,760
the bloodshed in Andu

196
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,560
begins.

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,480
Why are you arresting me?

198
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,520
Why?

199
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Let me go!

200
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,520
Why?

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,880
Let me go!

202
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,360
Let go of me!

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,800
Why are you arresting me?

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,400
You...

205
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,440
Dongfang Zui!

206
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,280
I'm under General Wei Su

207
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,080
of the Capital Defense Forces.

208
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
Are you blind?

209
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
How dare you arrest me!

210
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,320
You...

211
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,840
Dongfang Zui.

212
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,880
Dongfang Zui.

213
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,520
General!

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,480
General.

215
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
Help me, general.

216
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,440
General Wei.

217
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Dongfang Zui.

218
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,280
What's the meaning of this?

219
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm acting for the heavens

220
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,400
on His Majesty's decree

221
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
to eliminate evil
and protect the people.

222
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,920
Do I need to report to unrelated parties

223
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
when arresting a few scoundrels?

224
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,640
You...

225
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,680
Acting for the heavens?

226
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
Is this truly His Majesty's will,

227
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,160
or just your own personal vendetta?

228
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,800
What vendetta?

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,520
He

230
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
abducted women,

231
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,280
extorted money and caused deaths.

232
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
He's guilty of heinous crimes.

233
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,880
He deserves to die.

234
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,800
I...

235
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,800
I didn't do it!

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,320
General!

237
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,680
General, I didn't do it!

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,840
It's him!

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,920
He's framing me, general!

240
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,960
Dongfang Zui,

241
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
you deceived His Majesty.

242
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
You deserve to die!

243
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm the Empress's nephew,
the Crown Prince's...

244
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,040
You...

245
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,680
He still doesn't know

246
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
why he had to die.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,600
What...

248
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
What do you mean?

249
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
General Wei, I heard your wife

250
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,560
is a relative of the Empress.

251
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
Surely, you understand

252
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
how closely linked fortune
and misfortune are.

253
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
General Wei,

254
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
Andu is about

255
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,240
to change.

256
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,680
