[Tragic End]

4
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,040
Chi.

5
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,120
How have you become like this?

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,440
My current predicament

7
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,000
is all thanks to you, mother.

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Now,

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
this is the only way

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
to win father's trust.

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
So

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,880
you've come to see me off.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
Abandon the pawn
to save the commander.

14
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Abandon the mother to save the son.

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,440
I never knew

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,400
you had become so evil.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,480
All these years,

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960
your careful teaching

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,520
was also to use me

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,280
to vie for the position
of Empress Dowager.

21
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Good.

22
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,000
Good.

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,880
My years of careful teaching

24
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,320
have only led to my own doom.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
Mother, you're foolish,

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,760
which deeply pains me.

27
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,160
But I can't disobey
my father, the Emperor.

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,640
I respectfully send you
on your way, mother.

29
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
He's indeed the Emperor.

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,360
But

31
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
he may not necessarily be your father.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
What do you mean?

33
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
What do you mean by that?

34
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,560
What do I mean?

35
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
What do you think?

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
My biological son

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,080
died of poison the day he was born.

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,280
You're merely

39
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,960
a substitute Man brought back
from outside the palace.

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
You think you've secured your position

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
and after the Emperor dies,

42
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,960
you'll become the ruler of Great Yu?

43
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,040
Chi,

44
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,960
you're too naive.

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
He's already suspicious of you.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,760
If you don't act soon,

47
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
my fate

48
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
will be your fate.

49
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,240
Yes,

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
whether you like it or not,

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,840
you must spare no effort

52
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,520
to sit on that supreme throne

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
and ensure the Lin family's prosperity.

54
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
I want to be the Empress Dowager.

55
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
I want to be buried
in the royal mausoleum.

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes.

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,400
Chi, you must hurry.

58
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,160
You must be faster, Chi.

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,440
Ensure the prosperity

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
of the Lin family.

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,160
Do you know why I slaughtered
the Na family years ago?

62
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,720
Do you know why I hate
that illegitimate child,

63
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Na Jinci, to the bone?

64
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,320
Because he's the true imperial heir.

65
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,760
Hurry and ascend the throne.

66
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,120
Hurry!

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
I want to be the Empress Dowager.

68
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,520
Your Majesty,

69
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm afraid

70
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,800
your sweet dream won't come true.

71
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,360
It's you.

72
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
It's you, you illegitimate child.

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
It's me,

74
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,560
the illegitimate child.

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,440
I crawled out of hell

76
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,640
to take revenge on you.

77
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,920
As long as I'm alive,

78
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
your expectations

79
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
will never come true.

80
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
Your body will be left
in the wilderness.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,840
You'll never enter the royal mausoleum.

82
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
The Lin family's ancestral hall

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
will never have your name.

84
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,200
As for the suffering

85
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
you brought to the Na family,

86
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll repay it

87
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,600
a thousandfold

88
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
to you.

89
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
This is impossible.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,880
This is impossible.

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
The Emperor has little time left.

92
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
Chi

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,000
is about to ascend
to the supreme throne.

94
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Impossible.

95
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,440
You're lying to me.

96
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,880
I've already prepared

97
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
the decree to depose the Crown Prince.

98
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
I want to see

99
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,520
how you'll get Li Chi on the throne.

100
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
What did you say?

101
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
Say it again.

102
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,200
You're really too foolish.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You've lost

104
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
this game.

105
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Do you think

106
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,800
you'll have a happy ending?

107
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,960
Do you even know
who the person you love is?

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,400
It was the Xie family
who surrounded and attacked

109
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,640
the Na family back then.

110
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
It was Xie Chongyuan!

111
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
You and Xie Wanyin

112
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,240
are doomed to a tragic end.

113
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Go to hell and watch

114
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,560
how I make you executioners

115
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,640
pay with blood

116
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,480

Your Majesty,

150
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
the Crown Prince...

151
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,400
Li Chi

152
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,880
has been kneeling
outside the hall for three days

153
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,080
without water or food.

154
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,720
His forehead wound hasn't been treated

155
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,960
but he insists on waiting outside
for you to summon.

156
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,600
Your Majesty...

157
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,120
Summon him in.

158
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
Yes.

159
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Quickly.

160
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,880
Father.

161
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,600
You're still a prince of the nation.

162
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,480
How could you end up like this?

163
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm deeply concerned
for Your Majesty's health,

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
so I truly can't care
for my own appearance.

165
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
If I've offended Your Majesty,

166
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
please forgive me.

167
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
At this point,

168
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,000
you...

169
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,120
Your Majesty.

170
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,720
Father,

171
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,880
please don't get angry.

172
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,760
Your Majesty's illness is worsening.

173
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,080
I do have a remedy,

174
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,960
but it requires the blood and flesh

175
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,240
of a close relative as medicine,

176
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,680
supplemented with silver needles
for several months

177
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,680
for a chance of cure.

178
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,520
Chi.

179
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Physician Zhen,

180
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,320
can this blood

181
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,200
and flesh

182
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,120
save my father?

183
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
I'll have to try.

184
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,040
No need to draft it.

185
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,800
You may leave.

186
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

187
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,360
I'll go prepare the medicine
for Your Majesty.

188
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Chi,

189
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,520
why do you torment yourself like this?

190
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,560
Now that I've lost my mother,

191
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,520
I can't...

192
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,840
In the future,

193
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,400
I only wish to remain in the palace,

194
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,400
using my blood as medicine,

195
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,160
cutting flesh to treat your illness

196
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,920
and praying for your swift recovery.

197
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
I ask for

198
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,560
nothing else.

199
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,080
Forget it.

200
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
I will

201
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,040
fulfill your wishes.

202
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
Thank you, father.

203
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
Thank you, father.

204
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,440
Thank you, father.

205
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,960
Father.

206
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Father.

207
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,160
Father.

208
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,760
Father.
