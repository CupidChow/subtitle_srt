[Crown Prince Mansion]

5
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,680
Your Highness truly values punctuality.

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
Yin,

7
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,560
you're safe.

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,320
That's great. I knew you wouldn't die.

9
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,720
Your Highness, please behave yourself.

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
I heard about

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
what happened to the Xie family.

12
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,160
I should've killed Na Jinci earlier

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
and protected the Xie family.

15
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,800
My parents

16
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
and brother

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,280
died in vain at the border.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,240
The corpses of soldiers
are strewn across the land.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,560
This time, my grudge with that traitor

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
isn't just personal.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,880
It's also a national vendetta.

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Have you really moved on from him?

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,920
Moved on?

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,040
I wish I could see him
suffer a thousand cuts.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
I won't rest until he's dead.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
Is this the reason you asked me to come?

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
Yes.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
I want to make a deal
with Your Highness.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Alright.

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
What help do you need?

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Tell me.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
His Majesty is critically ill

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
and Your Highness is about
to ascend the throne.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
Surely, you don't want any loose ends.

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,840
Na Jinci shares
the same bloodline as you.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
Such a threat

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
can't be left alive.

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
But

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
what's your plan?

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Na Jinci is cunning and deceptive.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
I have the Scent Pill in my body.

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
He made me take it

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,280
to monitor me.

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,600
Now, I can use it

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
to lure him out

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
and have him killed.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
Are you certain

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
he'll take the bait?

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm absolutely sure.

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
However,

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
I have one condition.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Tell me.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
I want to kill him with my own hands.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
He's your husband.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,120
You once loved each other.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Are you truly willing to do it?

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,160
My husband

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,680
should die by my hand.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Alright.

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
I'll be watching.

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Yin,

62
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
what are you doing?

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
When I'm wounded and bleeding,

64
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
the scent in my body will be activated.

65
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,360
He can sense it even from afar.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,400
The Preceptor's schemes

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
are truly chilling.

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,400
He forcefully married you,
imprisoned you

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,320
and even toyed with your heart.

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,000
Not even I can compare.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,120
At least it's not too late for me
to see his true nature.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,240
Liangwei Mountain
is filled with ambushes.

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
I don't believe Na Jinci

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
hasn't noticed.

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Your relationship with him
isn't what it used to be.

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,760
Are you sure

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
he'll risk coming because of the scent?

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
He will.

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
Even if it means
going through fire and blade

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
or hell itself,

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,520
he'll come.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Yin,

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
how have you been?

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Quite well.

85
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
If you were dead,

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
I'd probably be even better.

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,640
At this point, your infatuation

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,920
is useless.

89
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Yin,

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
did you ally with him willingly

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,240
without any coercion?

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Yes.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,920
So today, you brought me here

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
of your own accord

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
to settle things with me?

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
That's right.

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Knowing you weren't forced,

98
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,320
I'm relieved.

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
Even without His Highness's help,

100
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,120
you and I

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,760
would come to this day eventually.

102
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,320
Yin,

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
about our past,

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,280
I have no words to defend myself.

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920
But he mustn't

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,120
be allowed to live.

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Yin,

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
do you hate me this much?

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,120
Yes.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,560
Na Jinci,

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,440
when you were scheming and deceiving me,

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
did you ever think this day would come?

113
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
This stab

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,440
is for all your lies

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
and arrogance.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
I never...

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
Since we're settling things today,

118
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
let's make everything clear.

119
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
The day you forced me into marriage,

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
you threatened the lives
of my parents, my brother

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,640
and the 100 thousand soldiers
of the Xie Army.

122
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes or no?

123
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,360
Are you sure it's just four of you?

124
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,360
I seem to recall

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
the Xie family

126
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
commands 100 thousand troops in Youzhou.

127
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Yes.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
You have a deep grudge
with the royal family

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,360
and once told me you'd never rest
until you had your revenge.

130
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
Yes or no?

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes.

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,920
Your entire family was massacred

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
by my grandfather with the troops.

134
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Yes or no?

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Yes.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,280
But...

137
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
No buts.

138
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,480
I saw it with my own eyes

139
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
and heard it with my own ears.

140
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,400
You've inscribed the entire Xie family
on your memorial tablets

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
as offerings to the heavens.

142
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Now that your revenge is fulfilled,

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
do you feel satisfied?

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
This stab

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
is for the souls of the ancestors

146
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,040
and the hatred of my family and country.

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Na Jinci,

148
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,600
the day

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,320
I knelt before the Na Family
Ancestral Hall

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
and swore an oath with you.

151
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,680
Did you think I was a joke?

152
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,520
Yin,

153
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
is that what you think of me?

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,560
Yes.

155
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Yes.

156
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm a cold-hearted person

157
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
who doesn't understand love.

158
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
But I finally learned

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,600
and I held on to it.

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
But from the start,

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
I was wrong.

162
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,640
This stab

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,480
is for myself,

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,520

Yin,

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,080
I never lied to you.

167

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
♪Yet he ventured into the tumult
of the world, taking a journey♪

192
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,480
♪He's like the moon falling
into the dust, full of desolation♪

193
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,450
♪Thus, partings in life and death
became commonplace♪

194
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,380
♪Witnessing the fleeting affairs
of the world♪

195
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,560
♪Too barren♪

196
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,840
Very good.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,000
What a passionate lover.

198
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
I almost

199
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,760
fell in love with him.

200
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Fortunately, Yin,

201
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,920
you're no longer blinded by his lies.

202
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm deeply relieved.

203
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,800
The deal between Your Highness
and I is done.

204
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,720
Let's part ways here.

205
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,880
Yin,

206
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,600
we grew up together.

207
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,320
Despite the misunderstandings,

208
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
I've always been sincere to you.

209
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
Now that the obstacle is gone,

210
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,480
there's nothing between us anymore.

211
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Come back to the palace with me.

212
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,200
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

213
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,200
[Three Days Later]

214
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Yin.

215
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
Something on your mind?

216
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,120
Though he was stabbed three times
and fell off the cliff,

217
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,520
his skills are profound

218
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,560
and he might not be dead.

219
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,880
If Your Highness wants peace of mind,

220
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,800
you should send people
to search the mountain.

221
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,560
Make sure you see his body.

222
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Exactly.

223
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,240
You know me well.

224
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
I've already sent people
to investigate the base of the cliff,

225
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,480
but the guards reported

226
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,240
no body was found.

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Judging by the blood trail,

228
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
it seems he headed north.

229
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
The northern region is desolate

230
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
with few soldiers stationed there.

231
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,280
If he escapes,

232
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
it'll be impossible to track.

233
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,280
I know a shortcut

234
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,680
which heads northwest

235
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
across the Liu River.

236
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,200
It's faster than taking the land route
and leads directly to Jialan Pass.

237
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Be sure to send the best warriors

238
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
and kill him

239
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,440
before he crosses the pass.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Yin,

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,520
your ruthlessness

242
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,000
makes even me shudder.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Na Jinci,

244
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,160
if you don't show up soon,

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,520
I'll have to look for you.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,680
Really?

247
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,280
