00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
This is indeed Red Spiderwort.

5
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
Li Chi's countless calculations

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,960
failed to account

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,040
for this small sachet.

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
It's barely enough
to make the antidote.

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
What should we do?

10
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,200
Jiang Yan's poison has flared up.

11
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,960
What's happening?

12
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
Yin.

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,320
Master, have you lost your mind?

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,480
We only have one antidote
made from Red Spiderwort.

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,560
Are you...

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Save Jiang Yan.

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
No way.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,680
This won't work.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,280
We can't sacrifice you

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
to save the child.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,720
There must be another way.

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,360
Jiang Yan's poisoning isn't as serious.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
This antidote could be split
into two doses.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,640
No.

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,840
The ingredients in the formula
are very strong.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
Without Red Spiderwort as a catalyst,

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
it becomes a fatal poison.

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,720

can only save one person.

Death is still inevitable.

Although Winter Glory Flower is useful,

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,000
it's also highly toxic.

147
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,160
Once ingested,

148
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,320
it restores sight instantly

149
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,960
but will make one
lose all martial skills

150
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,200
and become a cripple.

151
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,800
Moreover, it only prolongs life
for six months.

152
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,600
If you can't find Red Spiderwort
within six months,

153
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080
even the gods can't save him.

154

you might not know,

156
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
but Red Spiderwort

157
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,960
takes ten years to grow a single plant.

158
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,240
Finding one

159
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,960
would be a miracle.

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
We'll only have six months.

161
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
That's enough.

162
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
Even if we can't find Red Spiderwort,

163
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,920
didn't we agree?

Being together for a day

165
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720

166
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
Alright,

167
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,320
once you're better,

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,960
we'll immediately set out
to find Red Spiderwort.

169
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
Coincidentally,

170
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,200
Red Spiderwort grows in the desert.

171
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm familiar with the terrain

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,720
and have manpower.

173
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
There's no need for him.

174
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,840
It's inconvenient for him
to move around.

175
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,720

see off the guest.

178
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
The journey will be long and arduous

179
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,040
and the desert is extremely dangerous.

180
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
With your current condition,

181
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
I can only be rest assured

182
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
if you bring more people.

183
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,360
Now that the enemies
have been eliminated,

184
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,040
we'll travel light

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,320
and comfortably.

186
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,080

Master,

197
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,960
at least let me see you off
one last time.

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
The Emperor won't last three months.

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
If he passes away,

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,600
we won't return.

216
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
Everything will be better.

217
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,440
There's a vast world
beyond the Great Wall.

but have acted recklessly,

225
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,280

226
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,240

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,720
The sins are mine alone to bear

228
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
and I dare not pardon myself.

229
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,120
Today, I express deep remorse
for the past

230
