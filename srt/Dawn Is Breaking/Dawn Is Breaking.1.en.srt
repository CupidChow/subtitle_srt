[Episode 1]
[Divine Punishment]

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
Your Highness,
please don't speak or move.

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,040
Observe fasting and meditation.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait for the auspicious time
of the wedding two hours later.

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,280
The imperial rituals

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,600
allow no mistakes.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
The Crown Prince's wedding
will be held in the Yu Hall.

10
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,600
You mustn't consume any common food.

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Please endure it.

[Xie Wanyin]

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Two hours?

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,880
That's enough.

15
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
We're almost there.

16
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Eunuch De,

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,000
does His Majesty have
any instructions for me?

18
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
Why was I summoned here?

19
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,520
It was the State Preceptor.

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,840
He heard you're also practicing Taoism

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
and wanted to discuss
doctrines with you.

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
The Preceptor?

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,680
You've secluded yourself
in your fief to practice Taoism,

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,600
so you might not know.

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,280
Recently,

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,280
His Majesty appointed the Immortal Lord
Dongfang Zui as the State Preceptor.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
What Immortal Lord?

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,880
He's just a deceiver.

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
If we're talking about deceivers,

30
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,340
[Dongfang Zui]

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,040
who could outdo you, Duke?

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,680
You...

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,400
You forced your daughter to her death

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,600
and massacred an entire family.

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,880
Now you hide in your fief,
discussing profound doctrines.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Isn't it because you're afraid
the ghosts will seek revenge?

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Who are you?

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm the only surviving heir of
the Na family you slaughtered,

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,880

Speaking of which,

43
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,760
Duke,

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,290
you're technically
my maternal grandfather.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
It's you!

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
You unfilial wretch!

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,640
You demon!

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
That's right.

49
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm a demon.

50
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,400
Today,

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll take your life on behalf
of the 40-plus members

52
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,280
of the Na family.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Two li away is the Crown Prince's
wedding ceremony.

Na Jinci, how dare you kill me here?

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
Let's make a bet.

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,120
Two li away lies your escape route.

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,550
Five.

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,460
Four.

One.

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Oh no, he saw me.

63
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,840
I've been searching for so many years.

64
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,520
Here you are.

65
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Miss, you're finally back.

66
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

67
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
You scared me to death.

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,160

69
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,080

[Lyuzhu]
don't speak recklessly.

The wedding ceremony

73
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
requires the Crown Princess
to fast and meditate.

74
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,680
Otherwise, it'll anger the heavens,

75
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,760
bringing down divine punishment.

76
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,440
Miss, you've been here the whole time

77
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,680
and never left.

78
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Today is my wedding
with the Crown Prince.

79
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,260
Who is he?

80
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
He dares to openly kill the Duke

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
on such a day?

82
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,680
The Crown Prince is coming.

83
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
Miss, where are your earrings?

84
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh no!

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Quick, help me with my hair!

[Crown Prince, Li Chi]

87
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,960
I've waited

88
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
so long for today.

89
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,680
I specially requested father

90
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,480
to have the Preceptor

91
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
officiate and bless our marriage.

92
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,950
The Preceptor?

93
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
You reside in Youzhou,

94
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,920
so you may not know
the situation in Andu.

95
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,560
Father recently appointed
a new State Preceptor,

96
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
Dongfang Zui.

97
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
A crane's call echoes
through the high mountains.

98
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,880
Its sound reaches the heavens.

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
This is an auspicious sign.

100
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,120
The Preceptor is said to be
an Immortal Lord

101
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
who can understand the divine will.

102
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,160
Heaven will bless the Great Yu.

103
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,400
The State Preceptor has arrived.

104
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,120
Miss Xie,

105
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,800
step forward to offer sacrifices
to the Royal Stele,

106
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,440
pay homage to the ancestors

107
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,160
and receive divine grace.

108
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,960
It's him.

109
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
Stay calm.

110
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
He may not recognize me.

111
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't be nervous.

112
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,700
Let's go.

113
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,380
My son.

114
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,360
Today is your big day.

115
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,080
[Empress]
Pay your respects to your father.

116
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,360
Father, may you live long and well.

117
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
[Emperor]
Good.

118
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,560
We meet again,

119
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,840
Your Highness.

120
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,320
He recognized me.

121
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,120
Your...

122
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't worry.

123
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,360
It's just a little mute medicine.

124
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,360
Once the ceremony is over,

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,080
Your Highness will
be able to speak again.

126
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,360
Today, we have the daughter
of General Zhenyuan,

127
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,720
Miss Xie Wanyin.

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,160
She's noble yet frugal,

129
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,560
diligent in following the rules,

130
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,490
supportive in her duties

131
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,490
and promoting harmony and kindness.

132
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,160
She shall be betrothed
to Crown Prince, Li Chi

133
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
and is now conferred
the title of Crown Princess.

134
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
This is an ominous sign.

135
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,390
[Sacrificial Altar]

136
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,480
I'll protect

137
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,680
my own Crown Princess.

138
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,240
No need to trouble you, Preceptor.

139
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,320
If that's the case,

140
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
Your Highness, you should
guard her well.

141
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,880
Today is the auspicious day
of the Crown Prince's marriage.

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
Why did the solar eclipse
suddenly occur,

143
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,440
even causing the Royal Stele
to collapse?

144
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,000
It seems this marriage

145
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,640
doesn't have divine approval.

146
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Your Majesty,

147
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,400
there must be something suspicious
about the divine punishment.

148
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Let go of me! Let go!

149
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,200
I have something important!

150
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,680
I have something important
to tell His Majesty!

151
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,670
I need to...

152
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:17,760
You!

153
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
Shouting like this

154
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
is inappropriate.

155
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,760
How dare you!

156
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,880
Who gave you the audacity

157
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,840
to slap the Crown Princess?

158
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm here under the Empress's order

159
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
to inform the Crown Princess,

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,600
oh no,

161
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,880
I mean Miss Xie.

162
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,720
On such an auspicious day,

163
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
you provoked divine punishment.

164
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,200
His Majesty is very angry.

165
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,720
Miss Xie, you should
reflect on your actions

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,840
and await further instructions.

167
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,280
A mere servant

168
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
dares to show such arrogance
before the masters?

169
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,240
It seems I've been too lenient with you.

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,920
Take her away.

171
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Slap her 30 times.

172
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,040
Your Highness,

173
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
please have mercy!

174
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,400
Your Highness.

175
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
Your Highness,

176
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
Dongfang Zui is suspicious.

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,600
I saw him shooting and killing the Duke
on Liangwei Mountain.

178
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,800
Yin, what's wrong?

179
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,200
It's true, Your Highness.

180
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,480
Isn't he supposed to be able
to predict the future?

181
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
The Stele breaking

182
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,320
and the solar eclipse

183
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
must've caused by him.

184
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,080
It was him!

185
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,920
Yin!

186
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Yin, what's wrong?

187
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,520
I saw it with my own eyes.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
He's definitely going to kill me.

189
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,840
Yin.

190
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
The Duke is dead.

191
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,000
Yin.

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,880
You must go see His Majesty.

193
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,680
Yin.

194
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,800
The Duke just attended our ceremony.

195
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
He was summoned

196
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
and is now discussing matters
with father in the front hall.

197
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
What did you say?

198
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,200
You're well-versed in Taoism.

199
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,600
The collapse of the Royal Stele

200
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
is no small matter.

201
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,120
Please, help me inquire

202
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
about the divine will.

203
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,040
With the Preceptor present,

204
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,160
I dare not speculate on the divine will

205
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,480
with my limited skills.

206
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
You may not know,

207
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,760
but before the Crown Prince's wedding,

208
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,560
the Preceptor read the stars
and prophesied I'd have a son,

209
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,600
whose destiny is unmatched in nobility.

210
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,560
He also foretold this child and Miss Xie
were a perfect match.

211
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,280
But today's events

212
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
make me question

213
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,560
whether the Preceptor was mistaken.

214
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,930
If that's the case,

215
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,840
then I shall draw a divination

216
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,790
for Your Majesty.

217
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,720
This child isn't the Crown Prince?

218
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
How is that possible?

219
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,800
This can't be!

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,880
What's wrong?

221
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
What did you discover, Duke?

222
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,280
Speak freely.

223
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,400
The Crown Prince is indeed
of the highest nobility.

224
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,000
There's no problem.

225
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
I discovered nothing.

226
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
I'll take my leave.

227
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,000
Ah, Duke.

228
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,120
Duke, please wait.

229
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,880
Is there something wrong
with the Crown Prince?

230
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,920
Yin,

231
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,800
were you frightened?

232
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,600
No, it can't be.

233
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

234
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Yin, don't be afraid.

235
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,960
I'll handle everything.

236
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,840
You should rest here.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,120
Tomorrow morning, I'll go see father.

238
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,200
Rising from the dead?

239
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,480
How is that possible?

240
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
Why not?

241
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,200
Why is it you?

242
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
Did you get slapped?

243
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,680
Thanks to you.

244
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,160
I knew it.

245
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,360
The Crown Prince can't protect you.

246
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,000
No need for you to worry.

247
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,320
Being alone in a woman's chamber

248
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,130
at this hour is improper.

249
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
Please leave.

250
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,880
What do you want?

251
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,480
I intended to kill you,

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,240
but now

253
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
I want you to marry me.
