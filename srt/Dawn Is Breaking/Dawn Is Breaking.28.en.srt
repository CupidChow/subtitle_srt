[Episode 28]
[Madness]

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,480
A square courtyard

5
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,880
surrounded by high walls.

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Yue,

7
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,680
I finally understand
how you felt back then.

8
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Miss.

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,560
Let's talk inside.

10
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,240
Come.

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
What's wrong?

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,920
This morning, I went
to the market as usual,

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,600
but someone stopped me.

14
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,680
He said you should meet him
at the Yuelai Inn.

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I feared he might be
one of the Preceptor's men,

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,880
so I came to inform you immediately.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,320
If he wanted to see me,

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
he wouldn't make it difficult for me.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,960
It's not him.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
Andu has been fraught
with danger lately.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
You shouldn't leave the palace
for a few days.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,040
But that person said

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,120
you'd meet him

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,440
after reading his letter.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,200
Knowing what troubles you,

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,280
I've brought evidence
of Li Chi's treason.

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
Please come to the Yuelai Inn.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
I hope I can share your worries.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Respectfully, Pei Che of Dafeng.

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
I knew you'd come, miss.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,920
Where did you get the evidence?

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
As far as I know,

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,040
Li Chi communicated directly
with the Khan of Dafeng.

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
That was the old Khan.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
The new Khan of Dafeng

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,760
is me.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Pei is my mother's surname.

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
My Dafeng name

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
is Wanyan Che.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
The third prince of Dafeng?

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
After returning to the royal court,

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,320
I killed the old Khan
and my half-brothers.

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
Now I rule the northern desert.

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,240
You, a Khan, sneaked
into the enemy's capital

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,720
just to deliver letters to me?

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,920
I know you have a grudge against Li Chi

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
so I came to help.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Tell me,

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
what do you want

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,480
in exchange for these letters?

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,000
Your words chill my heart, miss.

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,720
Li Chi slaughtered your family

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
and avenging you is my duty.

54
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
Asking for something in return?

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Miss, what kind of person
do you think I am?

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,040
Well,

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
you're just going to give them to me?

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,880
I am,

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,360
as a way to repay your kindness.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,080
This evidence would indeed be helpful,

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
but I don't want to
take advantage of the favor

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,480
and owe you.

63
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,920
So let's do this.

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,400
If you ever need something
in the future,

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,240
as long as it doesn't go
against my principles,

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll do my utmost to help.

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,840
Indebtedness creates ties.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Miss, do you fear owing me

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
because you don't want any ties with me?

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
My husband is a jealous man

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
with a complicated mind.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
If he knew

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,560
I owed too many favors,

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
he wouldn't be happy.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,640
Thank you.

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,960
The affection between you runs deep.

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,640
She's so proud,

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
yet she cares if you're happy or not.

79
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,480
She treats me well, of course.

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,640
Indeed,

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
she treats you sincerely.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
But what about you?

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,360
You don't trust her at all,

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,720
to the point of following her
even to an old friend like me?

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Didn't you hear what my wife said?

86
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,160
I am

87
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
a jealous man.

88
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Besides,

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
what ties do we have

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,200
with you?

91
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
You're a foreign Khan.

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
You snuck into Andu.

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,360
How do I know you won't harm her?

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,160
Of course, I wouldn't harm her.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm nothing like you.

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,960
I treat her with genuine sincerity.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,160
Is that so?

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,120
But with you,

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I wouldn't be so sure.

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh, by the way,

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,760
I meant to say last time,

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,280
judging by your complexion,

103
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
I don't think you have long to live.

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
As long as I'm alive,

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
I'll protect her.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,040
It doesn't matter.

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll outlive you.

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
After you die,

109
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
there'll be no obstacles

110
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
between me and her.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Khan.

112
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
Bad news, Khan.

113
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
The Imperial Guards tracked our men
who entered the city.

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
They've surrounded the inn.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Useless!

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Follow me.

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
You've led me into a dead end?

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
If you want to live, follow me.

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,320
Are you with Li Chi?

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Can't you use your brain?

121
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,280
This is Andu,

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
not court of the northern desert.

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,560
Besides the route on the surface,

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
there's an underground tunnel.

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Underground?

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh my.

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,960
Where's the tunnel?

128
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It's a hole for dogs.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you coming or not?

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,280
I...

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,840
We should both leave.

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't want to owe you any favors.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
The pursuers are almost here.

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,640
Someone needs to distract them.

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,280
What are you doing?

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,120
Do you think it's for you?

137
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
It's all for Yin.

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
What? Can't bear to leave?

139
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,320
I owe you a favor.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,200
I'll repay it later.

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
You talk too much.

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
Dongfang Zui,

143
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
you're still alive?

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Go!

145
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,840
After him!

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
Kill Dongfang Zui in Andu.

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
You're so heartless, Xie Wanyin.

148
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,400
You've made a fool of me.

149
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
You must feel very pleased
with yourself.

150
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,200
You even stabbed him
three times on Liangwei Mountain.

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,880
You've always known

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,840
what kind of person I am, haven't you?

153
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,440
That's right.

154
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
You're exactly that kind of person,

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,280
just like Na Jinci.

156
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,360
Today, I'll teach you

157
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
what it means to accept your fate.

158
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,680
Let go of me!

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,000
If you think violence
will make me yield,

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,280
then you've underestimated me.

161
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
The Xie family has no cowards.

162
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,640
I won't argue with you.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,040
That slap,

164
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
consider it payback.

165
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
But

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
if you dare have any more thoughts,

167
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
think about your brother.

168
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,880
My brother is indeed in your hands.

169
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,080
Of course he is.

170
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
After dozens of tortures,

171
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
he's still breathing.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,320
Truly the youngest general of Great Yu.

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
The man has a strong will.

174
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,920
So it was you

175
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,080
who orchestrated the massacre
of my entire family.

176
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,920
Just wait.

177
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,040
I'll kill you with my own hands.

178
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,840
I'll kill you!

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,080
You suspected it long ago, didn't you?

180
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,840
I knew it.

181
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,960
My Yin is the smartest.

182
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
But what can you do?

183
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Tomorrow morning

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,320
is my coronation.

185
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
In the end,

186
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,680
I've won.

187
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,840
I won't let you get what you want!

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
You just don't know how to submit.

189
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,640
If Na Jinci hadn't interfered,

190
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
you'd have married me back then.

191
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,720
Once the Emperor dies,

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll ascend the throne openly.

193
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,400
Why would I need
these underhanded tactics?

194
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
The Xie family wouldn't have died.

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,440
It's all your fault.

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
You and Na Jinci are to blame.

197
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
Let go!

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Let go!

199
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,720
Let go of me!

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
Let go!

201
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,960
Lyuzhu.

202
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,360
Lyuzhu.

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Lyuzhu.

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Lyuzhu.

205
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
Lyuzhu.

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,840
At my coronation,

207
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,040
I want you to wear the wedding dress

208
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,520
and complete our unfinished wedding.

209
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Did you find out?

210
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,600
After you showed yourself,

211
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Li Chi not only tightened
security in the palace,

212
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,400
but also sealed off
the Crown Prince Mansion.

213
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,880
I think

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
the dungeon in it is
where they're keeping General Xie.

215
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
I know him too well.

216
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,440
Li Chi is cautious and suspicious,

217
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,480
but he

218
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,960
doesn't know there's a saying,

219
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
"The cleverest schemes can backfire."

220
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Will you talk?

221
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,560
Will you talk?

222
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,720
Will you talk?

223
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,880
Will you talk?

224
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
Stop being stubborn.

225
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
I want to see

226
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,160
if your bones are harder

227
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,840
than my whip.

228
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Will you talk?

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,080
Will you talk?

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
Will you talk?

231
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600
Dare to glare at me?

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,520
I'll gouge your eyes out.

233
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,040
It's you.

234
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,240
How did you get in here?

235
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
I fought my way in.

236
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,600
Are you OK?

237
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,920
Can you walk?

238
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,360
Let's go.

239
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,240
Prison break!

240
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,200
Capture the intruders.

241
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,600
Leave no one alive.

242
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Yes.

243
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
What's this?

244
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
The 29th year of Tianyan,

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,120
a wooden bucket

246
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,040
in the stable

247
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,000
of the Na family.

248
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,520
Marquis Xie, what's in it?

249
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,960
Nothing,

250
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,760
just a bucket of dirty water.

251
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Let's go.

252
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,000
It's you,

253
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
the child of the Na family.

254
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm the son of the Na family,

255
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,720
Na Jinci.

256
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
General Xie, thank you
for your kindness back then.

257
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,440
Today, I repay you.

258
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,160
In a moment,

259
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,440
someone will come to collect the feces

260
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,760
and smuggle you out.

261
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Please.

262
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Father.

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,240
I've been so devoted

264
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
tending to you daily.

265
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,880
Yet you still won't hand over
the imperial seal to me?

266
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,760
You animal.

267
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
Father, why do you insist on this?

268
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
Hand over the seal

269
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,640
and retire as Emperor Emeritus.
Wouldn't that be good?

270
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,440
I won't let you have it your way.

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
Even if I die,

272
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,080
I'll never hand over Great Yu

273
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
to you, you animal.

274
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,160
You'll never have it!

275
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,680
Unfortunately, I'm your only son.

276
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,400
When you die,

277
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,960
the empire will naturally be mine.

278
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,880
You're not my son.

279
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,440
You're a bastard of low birth.

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
You're unworthy.

281
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,440
Unworthy!

282
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,080
So you knew all along.

283
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,240
That's why you were so eager to marry
and produce an heir to replace me.

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,280
I only regret not killing you back then.

285
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
But what did I do wrong?

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,320
I've always been
respectful and virtuous.

287
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,400
It was mother who hid the truth.

288
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,800
It's your suspicion and cruelty

289
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,040
that drove me to this.

290
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,280
You forced me into this!

291
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,360
Hand over the seal

292
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,400
and I'll give you a quick death.

293
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,160
The seal?

294
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,640
I don't have it.

295
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,400
The royal family and ministers
will never accept you.

296
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,480
I want to see how long

297
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,560
your dream will last.

298
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
How long!

299
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,360
Give me the seal!

300
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,160
Stop!

301
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,320
Stop, I'll tell you.

302
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,360
I'll tell you where the seal is.

303
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,800
I'll tell you

304
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,960
where the seal is.

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
I'll tell you.

306
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,040
The seal...

307
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
The seal is hidden in a place

308
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
where you'll never find it.
