3
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
Hongling, you should return.

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,920
Chunsheng,

5
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,320
be careful.

6
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,640
You too.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't worry.

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll be fine.

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
Remember to write back to me.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,720
I will.

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,160
Alright.

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Don't be loath to part.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
We have a fierce battle to fight.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,320
I have to go.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Go.

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Go back.

17
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Is Jia Hui among them?

18
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,760
No.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The one taking the lead
is Jia Hui's No.1 goon,

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Dayong.

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
They look like they're about to
make a move.

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,920
Come on.

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,320
We're ready.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Keep cool.

25
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
We shouldn't strike the first blow

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
lest their suspicions will be aroused.

27
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Don't worry.

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,400
Our people have fixed it all up.

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
They dare not act rashly.

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Get on.

31
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,300
(Kunming - Chuxiong)

32
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,940
(Inflammable and explosives
strictly prohibited)

33
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
Why do you think

34
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Jia Hui hasn't shown up yet?

35
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
Don't worry. He will show up.

36
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,400
Just now at the bus station,

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,440
Dayong was about to make a move.

38
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
They might have backed down

39
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
because they saw us there.

40
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
That met our expectations.

41
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,200
We're two kilometers away from Anning.

42
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
Then we'll be out of Kunming.

43
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Didn't Jia Hui boast that

44
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
he wouldn't let me
get out of Kunming alive?

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,520
Then he'll definitely take action

46
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,080
before I leave Kunming.

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,920
Be patient.

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Come on.

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
We're ready.

50
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
We're out of Kunming now.

51
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
But Jia Hui didn't show up.

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
He seems to be scared by you guys.

53
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
There seems to be nothing remarkable
about him.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He just talked big.

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,280
Captain Zhan,

56
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
we're already out of Kunming.

57
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,400
I don't think Jia Hui will make a move.

58
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Why don't you leave us here?

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
We'd better escort you.

60
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
No worries. It's OK.

61
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,560
OK.

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
We'll leave you here.

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Stay safe
during the rest of the journey.

64
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,000
OK.

65
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Comrade Chunsheng, thank you.

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,160
- See you.
- Take care.

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,520
Stay safe.

68
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Go.

69
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,760
Go!

70
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,280
Open the door!

71
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,400
- Don't move. Hurry up.
- Don't move.

72
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,040
Don't move.

73
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
Get off.

74
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,200
Get off.

75
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,040
Hurry up.

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Hurry up. Go!

77
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,360
Go. Hurry!

78
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,240
Get off.

79
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,840
Hurry up.

80
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,400
Hurry.

81
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,720
Hurry up.

82
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Get off.

83
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,880
Don't move.

84
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
Who is Xiao Chunsheng?

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,080
It's me.

86
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,120
Did you kill my brother?

87
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes.

88
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
He deserved more than death.

89
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,360
You're still playing tough
when your death is at hand.

90
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,360
Attaboy.

91
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
Not at all.

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,200
We're not sure whose death is at hand.

93
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
You just never say uncle.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,400
I'll help you.

95
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,360
Brother,

96
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,910
let me avenge you today.

97
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,200
- Police!
- Police!

98
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,790
Don't move!

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Put your gun down!

100
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,680
Surrender.

101
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Jia Hui,

102
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
we finally get you.

103
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
We are not able to
outwit you after all.

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,480
I just don't understand.

105
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,240
You want to understand?

106
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
Come with me. I'll explain to you.

107
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,960
- Take them away!
- Go.

108
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,680
- (The military leaders coordinated)
- Go.

109
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,120
Don't move.

110
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
(with multiple departments to work
with the public security sector)

111
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,980
- (in the action of trapping Jia Hui.)
- Comrade, don't get me wrong.

112
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,360
- (They also)
- We won't be wrong. Take them away.

113
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
- (approved the request of)
- Go.

114
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,320
(Xiao Chunsheng and Duan Lei
to participate in the action.)

115
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,200
- Go.
- Hurry up.

116
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Are you OK?

117
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Hurry.

118
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,520
Yeah. Don't worry.

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,640
Jia Hui, the old fox,

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
is really cunning and crafty.

121
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
It turns out that from the beginning,

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,640
those guys who followed us
from the hospital

123
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
were acting.

124
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,480
Those guys

125
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,440
acted well, though.

126
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,520
Tell me about it.

127
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,120
I was really nervous.

128
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,360
Moreover,

129
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
when they seemed to be about to

130
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,320
pull weapons from their pockets,

131
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,480
I thought

132
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
you might have made a mistake.

133
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,400
Then when I saw Dayong

134
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
take them away,

135
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,880
I started to admire you.

136
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
I was just guessing.

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,920
I hit the jackpot.

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,720
Wild guess.

139
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,640
Enough. Don't deny it.

140
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,760
How could you just guess it?

141
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
If you guessed wrong,

142
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,800
we would probably die.

143
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,920
Lei, I was really guessing.

144
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Let me put it this way.

145
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,560
When the bus arrived in Anning,

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
Captain Zhan got off with his team.

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
There were a man and a woman
sitting in front of us.

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,160
The man

149
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,960
followed Captain Zhan off the bus.

150
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
Not until then
was I sure I guessed right.

151
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,440
How could you be sure that

152
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
the pair was suspicious?

153
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Let me put it this way.

154
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
Since we got on the bus,

155
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
I had been observing the passengers.

156
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,840
All of them were normal

157
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,840
except for the pair in front of us

158
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
who looked sneaky.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
I wondered

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
if they were

161
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,040
sent by Jia Hui to monitor us.

162
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
So I talked about

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
Jia Hui and the case loudly on purpose.

164
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,880
Don't worry. He will show up.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,120
In the beginning,

166
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,400
Captain Zhan signaled me to
keep my voice down.

167
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
But when I gave him a wink,

168
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
he took the hint

169
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,880
and discussed it with me loudly.

170
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,960
Just now at the bus station,

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Dayong was about to make a move.

172
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,120
They might have backed down

173
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
because they saw us there.

174
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,480
Go.

175
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,120
Take it.

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,160
Pick one.

177
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,080
Cold rice noodles.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Cold rice noodles.

179
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,640
- Have a look.
- Vegetables.

180
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,840
So you were playacting with Zhan Jun

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,560
to fool the two stalkers?

182
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Exactly.

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
If I didn't do that,

184
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,240
how could they believe that
the Kunming police had retreated

185
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,520
and deliver the message to Jia Hui?

186
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,680
How could Jia Hui swallow the bait?

187
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
But Jia Hui never thought that

188
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
though Zhan Jun and his team

189
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,600
got off the bus,

190
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,800
the policemen of the Provincial
Public Security in plain clothes

191
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,880
got on.

192
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,080
Your plan was perfectly coherent.

193
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
Twice stung. Double traps.

194
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
No matter how cunning the fox is,

195
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
he has no chance of escaping.

196
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,480
Anyway, I only came up with the idea.

197
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
The concrete action was planned by

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,440
the public security sectors of Yunnan
and Kunming.

199
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,080
Your trickery was really

200
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
deceptive.

201
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,600
Even I was deceived.

202
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
I did the play unknowingly

203
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,400
with you guys.

204
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
Lei,

205
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,080
you're too honest.

206
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
It isn't because I'm honest.

207
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,280
I read too few books when I was young

208
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,320
and lacked education.

209
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,400
That's not true.

210
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,680
Lei, you know what,

211
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,120
I've read over and over again
Sun Tzu's Art of War

212
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,920
and famous wars in the history of
world war since I was young.

213
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,080
There are all kinds of strategies,
wisdom, maneuvers,

214
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,120
and tactics.

215
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,400
I've only learned a little bit.

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,360
I still have a long way to go.

217
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,680
Enough, bro.

218
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,120
You should teach me more and

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
increase my knowledge later on.

220
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,680
No problem. Leave it to me.

221
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,700
(Certificate of Merit)

222
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,420
(Xiao Chunsheng: Cooperated with Kunming
police to crack down on gang crimes...)

223
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,200
Hey,

224
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,800
how could you leave me there

225
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,720
and walk away?

226
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
How could you fight?

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,400
I hate fights.

228
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
You know that.

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Didn't you hear it?

230
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,880
They insulted me and called me a rapist.

231
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
I don't care.

232
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,840
It wasn't the first time.

233
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
I told you a month ago

234
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,320
that people gossiped about me.

235
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,920
Then answer me,

236
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
how did it get out?

237
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't know.

238
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,240
Do you know what they talked about you

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,360
and me?

240
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,520
No, and I don't want to know.

241
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
So you just left me there alone?

242
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,800
I called your name several times,

243
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,240
but you acted as if you didn't hear me.

244
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,640
Then you just left?

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,360
Sure.

246
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Ye Fang, I don't believe it.

247
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,520
I was fighting on your account.

248
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,440
But what did you do?

249
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
You just walked away.

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,560
You always care about
what people think of you

251
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,080
or talk about you.

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
Are you acquainted with them?

253
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
Are they your teachers or leaders?

254
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,840
What does their opinion
have to do with you?

255
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,560
Sure, you don't care.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
Because you planned the whole thing.

257
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,400
You made me take the blame

258
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,360
and I can't even explain it.

259
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,040
No wonder people say you're heartless

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,320
and you don't care about anything
other than studying.

261
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm unlike you.

262
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm a man and I value my reputation.

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,160
Why? Do you regret it?

264
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
Do you feel you're tricked?

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
I've never made you do anything.

266
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Leave me if you regret it.

267
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,880
If you don't want to take the blame,

268
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
go to explain it to everyone

269
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
or cry out your grievance.

270
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,080
Don't swallow the insult.

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,680
I regret it?

272
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,560
Ye Fang.

273
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,840
Fine.

274
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,880
I can't outargue you.

275
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
I'd better leave.

276
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,480
Hongling, I came to Kunming this time

277
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
because the municipal police

278
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,110
needed me to verify

279
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,040
some details

280
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,280
in reviewing Jia Hui's case.

281
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,920
So the military granted me leave.

282
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,960
Hongling,

283
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,040
we've finally come together.

284
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,320
It won't be long before you figure out

285
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,680
that everything has just begun.

286
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
How I wish we can move forward

287
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,960
together to the end.

288
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
We definitely will.

289
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
We've gone through all the difficulties.

290
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,560
I believe

291
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
what awaits us

292
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,280
will be an uphill road.

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,560
Walking uphill can be tiring.

294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,000
It won't be if we think about
the scenery along the road,

295
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
not to mention I'll walk with you.

296
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Stay here.

297
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,840
You should go back.

298
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,520
Already?

299
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,280
Have you forgotten the regulations?

300
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,800
If they see us,

301
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
I'll be in trouble.

302
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,760
OK.

303
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
Then, I'll watch you go,

304
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
OK?

305
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,240
Hongling,

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
I'll come to see you
when I get another chance.

307
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,600
Go ahead.

308
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,760
What Mrs. Huang referred to last time

309
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,800
should be these two places.

310
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
- We can play it a bit slower.
- Yeah.

311
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,380
(Develop art activities to consolidate
the socialist ideological front)

312
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,600
Mrs. Huang wants to see you.

313
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
See me?

314
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,200
Why?

315
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,080
I have no idea.

316
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Maybe you

317
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,760
get good luck again.

318
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,640
Report!

319
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,840
Come in.

320
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Ma'am, you want to see me?

321
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,320
Sit.

322
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,160
OK.

323
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,840
How's your rehearsal going?

324
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,280
It goes well. Thanks for your concern.

325
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Hongling,

326
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
you have great potential.

327
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,440
I've heard about your family situation.

328
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,880
You should cherish the opportunity

329
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,320
the Organization gave you.

330
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,160
Ma'am,

331
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,560
did I do something wrong?

332
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,560
I heard from a soldier
that you're seeing someone.

333
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,240
You should know military discipline.

334
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Ordinary soldiers
are subject to punishment

335
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,120
if they have a romance.

336
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Who told you so?

337
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,560
I can confront them in front of you.

338
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm not seeing anyone.

339
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,600
I know

340
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
young people

341
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,200
think love is important.

342
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
They can do anything for love.

343
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,360
But, after this stage,

344
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,240
you'll understand

345
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,800
love is just a mood,

346
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
a mood aroused by hormones in youth.

347
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,040
Hongling, remember,

348
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,120
nothing is more important
than your future.

349
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
I see. Thank you, ma'am.

350
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,000
Keep up the good work.

351
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,240
Don't betray our expectations of you.

352
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,120
OK. Go back.

353
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,710
At ease.

354
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,760
Guohua,

355
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,800
the three-month training of

356
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
the recruit company will soon be over.

357
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,400
What's your plan next?

358
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,520
Nothing special.

359
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,840
I'll return to my original unit.

360
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,440
You know

361
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,560
your unit is my original unit, too.

362
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,040
Back then,

363
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,160
I asked the regiment for you.

364
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,640
They let you come on one condition.

365
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,520
Condition? What is it?

366
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Their condition is,

367
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
one comes and a squad returns.

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,440
What does that mean?

369
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
Don't you understand?

370
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,160
Your final task
before returning to your unit

371
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,720
is to select an elite squad

372
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,800
among the recruits and bring them back.

373
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,800
An elite squad?

374
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,040
You know,

375
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,200
the recruits will be assigned to

376
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,680
various field forces after training.

377
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,720
Strike first to gain the advantage.

378
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Selecting elite soldiers

379
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,360
to build an elite squad is the task

380
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
your regimental leader assigned you.

381
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,280
Yes, sir!

382
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,480
I guarantee to fulfill the mission.

383
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,760
Sit down.

384
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,540
(Five-kilometer yomp,
third class, ten points)

385
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
Duan Lei, well done.

386
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,320
You would break the record
if you finished it one minute faster.

387
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,720
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

388
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,040
you've reached the standards.

389
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,600
Still, you're inferior to Duan Lei.

390
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,080
Yes, sir!

391
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Give me some more time.

392
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,280
I'll definitely overtake him.

393
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Do you know

394
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,320
what's going on lately?

395
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Everyone is going all out in training.

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,040
The whole company already knows.

397
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,440
Haven't you heard about it yet?

398
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,640
About what?

399
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,040
You and Platoon Leader Ye

400
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,480
seem not to be real friends.

401
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
You can comment on me.

402
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,120
But if you comment on my friend again,

403
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
I'll turn against you.

404
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
You should really reflect on
who you're going to turn against.

405
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Think about it.

406
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,840
Why don't you know such
an important matter as

407
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,480
the selection of the elite squad?

408
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,880
Won't we be assigned to

409
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
the field forces after the training?

410
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,360
What's the deal with the elite squad?

411
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you know?

412
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,440
Yes.

413
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm afraid only you and Qian Amao

414
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,520
are kept in the dark.

415
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,320
Enough, Meng Jinzhu.

416
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,360
Didn't you learn about it

417
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
before us due to your dad?

418
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,960
Sorry to disappoint you.

419
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,040
I made a prediction
based on my understanding

420
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,880
of the military
and the international situation.

421
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,160
I must remind you.

422
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,200
This is the crucial moment
to display our competence.

423
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,000
People from the higher authority
will come for selection at any time.

424
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
I'll be selected anyway.

425
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,960
Chunsheng will, too.

426
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
We'll definitely be selected.

427
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,200
But competence will decide

428
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
who is the elite of the elites.

429
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,240
Lei,

430
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
apples and oranges.

431
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,600
Sure.

432
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,320
I won't yield the chance to you.

433
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,840
It's great to compete with you

434
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,320
again.

435
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,980
(Develop art activities to consolidate
the socialist ideological front)

436
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,160
Have you heard that

437
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,760
an elite squad will be selected
from the recruits?

438
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,240
What has it to do with us?

439
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,360
The elite squad selection

440
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,120
doesn't happen every year.

441
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,600
It didn't start from this year, either.

442
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
Every year, after the training session
of the recruit company,

443
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,280
all field forces will rack their brains

444
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,400
to compete for the best recruits

445
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,520
for their companies.

446
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,360
They'll each show their prowess.

447
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
Though it isn't official,

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,640
it has become an unwritten convention.

449
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,800
The bottom line is, the soldiers selected

450
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,160
will be the best.

451
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,680
They won't be bad anyway.

452
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,280
They'll probably be promoted to cadres.

453
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,800
Right.

454
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,000
I heard that Company Commander Guo

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,520
also came from an elite squad.

456
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,880
He's selecting soldiers
for his original unit this time.

457
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,240
So he attaches great importance
to the selection.

458
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,520
Hongling,

459
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,280
are you friends with Xiao Chunsheng,

460
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,560
the most eye-catching recruit?

461
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,680
I saw him walk you back
to the troupe last time.

462
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,760
You were wrong.

463
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,840
He used to write to you, right?

464
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,880
I think he's infatuated with you.

465
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,960
As the old saying goes,

466
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,160
treasures are easy to seek

467
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,840
while a lover is hard to find.

468
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,360
Don't you know soldiers
are not allowed to date?

469
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,200
Or do you always disregard discipline?

470
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,000
I have news to announce.

471
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,560
Comrades,

472
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,360
by convention,

473
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,800
every year, our troupe sends
its backbone and creative personnel

474
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,640
to a company to experience life

475
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,880
and collect materials for new programs.

476
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
This year, we choose

477
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
the recruit company.

478
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
So the troupe decided that
a creative team

479
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
consisting of Secretary Liu
responsible for the creation,

480
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,280
the lead dancer of the dance team,

481
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,960
and He Hongling of the orchestra,

482
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
would report to the recruit company

483
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,240
tomorrow to experience life.

484
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Yes!

485
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Hongling.

486
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,440
Mengmeng, next time
I'll go fetch hot water.

487
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,600
Don't you have a bad back?

488
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Forget about that.

489
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,360
You know what,

490
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
last time Mrs. Huang
criticized you for dating.

491
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,520
Do you remember?

492
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,280
I think Chen Can must be the snitch.

493
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,560
Why?

494
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Others would turn a blind eye to
such a thing

495
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,560
even if they learn about it.

496
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,240
Except for her,

497
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
who else would find fault with you

498
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,160
and report to Mrs. Huang?

499
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,920
Never mind. It's all over now.

500
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
It isn't true, anyway.

501
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
It will subside in a while.

502
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,880
Are you really not dating?

503
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,240
Actually, I support you.

504
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
I'm really not.

505
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,840
Don't make wild guesses like they do.

506
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm going to do my laundry.

507
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,880
Have I really misunderstood?

508
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,800
Sir.

509
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,280
A girl. A girl.

510
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,080
A girl.

511
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,320
Comrade, we report to you under orders.

512
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Welcome the comrades

513
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,320
from the Art Troupe

514
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,800
to experience life in our company.

515
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,680
We're honored.

516
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,920
Why is there a girl in the camp?

517
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,760
Nothing surprising.

518
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,840
I hear that they are sent by the
Art Troupe of the Military Region

519
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,800
for experiences and creation.

520
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,560
Come on. Let's settle you down.

521
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,000
Give it to me.

522
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,320
No, thanks.

523
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,040
Let's go.

524
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,280
All squads, count off!

525
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,400
- Squad Three, count off.
- Squad One, count off.

526
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
One, two, three, four.

527
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,320
About turn!

528
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Salute!

529
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,600
Down!

530
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
Sir, all recruits assembled.

531
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,280
Fall into rank!

532
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,600
Everyone.

533
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,480
At ease.

534
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,800
Attention.

535
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,440
Today is the last day of training,

536
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,600
and you've demonstrated
strong willpower.

537
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,600
Above all,

538
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,200
Comrades Meng Jinzhu, Duan Lei

539
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
and Xiao Chunsheng

540
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
should be praised for their
outstanding performance.

541
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Next,

542
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,680
the best soldiers will participate

543
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,800
in the selection for elite soldiers.

544
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,960
Now, Platoon Leader Ye

545
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,160
will announce the competition events.

546
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,560
There must be something fishy.

547
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,360
Do you believe it?

548
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,680
Distance throw,

549
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
rifle shooting,

550
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,560
horizontal bar,

551
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,000
3,000 km shuttle run,

552
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,560
and rescue.

553
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,640
The above are

554
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,320
all the events for the elite selection.

555
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,160
Stop muttering.

556
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,720
Speak out if you have questions.

557
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,520
Report!

558
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,240
Why isn't the five-kilometer yomp
included?

559
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,600
This year's elite squad

560
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
mainly focuses on training

561
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,520
reconnaissance and sniper talents.

562
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,200
Apart from the soldiers'
personal strength,

563
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
we focus more on technical abilities.

564
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,720
Are we clear?

565
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,760
Why?

566
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,080
Why isn't such a classic event

567
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,040
as five-kilometer yomp included?

568
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,040
What do you think?

569
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
Because someone isn't good at it.

570
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,880
You know what,

571
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,280
I've long found that

572
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,200
someone with poor ability

573
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,040
can only rely on his connections.

574
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
He's a drag on the whole company.

575
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,720
Who are you talking about?

576
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
You!

577
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Say it again!

578
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,480
Stop fighting!

579
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,400
This is a military camp!

580
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,920
Do you know the rules?

581
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,040
Meng Jinzhu,

582
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000
my fists are used to hit enemies

583
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,600
instead of comrade-in-arms.

584
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,600
But I warned you

585
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,720
to let proof speak.

586
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,680
I won't allow you to start a rumor.

587
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,720
If you don't want people to
talk about it, you shouldn't do it.

588
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Why don't they just add your name
to the elite list?

589
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Why do they bother?

590
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
Even the regular

591
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
five-kilometer yomp has been canceled.

592
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
- Why can't we complain?
- Meng Jinzhu!

593
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,720
Will you stop talking?

594
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,320
Sit down.

595
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,600
Report.

596
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,280
Come in.

597
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,520
Guohua,

598
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,960
we must have
a five-kilometer yomp race.

599
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,520
Sit down.

600
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,200
Why do you think so?

601
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm afraid they will misunderstand you.

602
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,360
Misunderstand me for supporting you?

603
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,080
Chunsheng, I've made it clear.

604
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,800
I did it completely for the

605
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,600
specialization of the elite squad.

606
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,360
Moreover,

607
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,760
the competition events

608
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,560
were approved by
Company Commander Guo.

609
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,840
I have nothing to be afraid of.

610
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,480
Guohua, to be honest,

611
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,800
do you really have a selfless motive?

612
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm not afraid of losing.

613
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,560
But I'm afraid that
people will look down upon me.

614
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,240
I'm even more afraid that
people will look down on you.

615
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
Are you afraid that they will
look down upon me

616
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,160
or you will look down upon me?

617
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,040
In your mind,

618
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,760
I'm a person acting with partiality,

619
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,360
right?

620
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
Guohua, it's unfair.

621
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,560
We don't have the selection every year.

622
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,360
It bears on the future of many soldiers.

623
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,150
That's why you must be fair and just.

624
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
That's how you establish your authority

625
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,670
and make others believe you.

626
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,960
I practiced my authority

627
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
to cancel the five-kilometer yomp.

628
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,630
I've announced the selection events.

629
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,670
If we were on the battlefield,

630
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,920
my words would be military orders.

631
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Military orders are imperative

632
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,440
and cannot be overturned

633
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,480
just because of some complaints.

634
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,760
But still, they must be reasonable.

635
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,670
I really don't understand, Chunsheng.

636
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
It's supposed to be a win-win situation.

637
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,670
Why don't you accept it?

638
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,480
Why do you have to choose

639
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,840
the most difficult road?

640
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,040
The difficult road is the uphill road.

641
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,840
And I believe in my strength.

642
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,670
I won't lose in the five-kilometer yomp.

643
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,760
Alright.

644
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,000
Alright.

645
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,920
I won't stop you from
taking the uphill road.

646
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,190
But you must think it over.

647
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,080
You have to accept the consequence.

648
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Guohua,

649
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,480
you're the platoon leader
in charge of the elite squad.

650
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,360
It's a great responsibility.

651
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,320
You do know I'm the platoon leader?

652
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,360
Yanqiu.

653
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,640
My brother asked you to take care of us

654
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,880
instead of feeding us.

655
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,960
Why do you always sneak money to us?

656
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
It isn't much.

657
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,560
I just want your father to
buy some food with it

658
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,480
lest you always mind his business.

659
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,840
It's not easy for you to make money.

660
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,880
Save it up.

661
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,800
You haven't got a wife yet.

662
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,320
Do you think

663
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,280
we are getting old?

664
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,360
We both love to mind others' business.

665
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,520
You mind mine and I mind yours.

666
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,760
By the way, this...

667
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,960
Here.

668
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,040
Is it from Chunsheng?

669
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,800
Who else would it be?

670
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Tell him to mail the letter
to your house next time,

671
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,600
saving me the trouble to deliver it.

672
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,960
Come on. Sit down.

673
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,920
Open it quickly.

674
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,840
Look what he wrote.

675
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,360
Let me see.

676
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,840
He said that he won second place
in the skills competition

677
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
of the recruits.

678
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,440
He gained a lot of experience.

679
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,080
He knew there was always a bigger fish.

680
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,960
Look here.

681
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,800
He was preparing for
the elite squad selection.

682
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,920
He asked us not to be worried.

683
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,320
Everything is fine.

684
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,840
All fine.

685
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,480
Only second place?

686
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,560
The little rascal doesn't
compete for anything

687
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
except military skills.

688
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,600
He must be upset if he had lost.

689
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,880
Tell me about it.

690
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
Chunsheng is

691
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,280
really aspiring.

692
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,200
Unlike him,

693
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,080
I fool around aimlessly every day.

694
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,160
You'll definitely find a good job.

695
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,720
Thanks for comforting me.

696
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm not comforting you.

697
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,520
If you are a loser,

698
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,040
how could my brother regard you
as his big brother?

699
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,440
So you no longer hate me
as you did a few days ago?

700
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
After spending some time with you,

701
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,840
I think you're OK, actually.

702
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,000
OK?

703
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
Just OK?

704
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,440
You're warm-hearted,

705
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,680
honest, and loyal, OK?

706
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,880
That's true.

707
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,320
Actually, I think
you're not bad, either.

708
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,000
Sure.

709
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,080
Of course, I'm not bad.
Do you need to mention it?

710
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,360
So,

711
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm just wondering...

712
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,840
Wonder what?

713
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
Nothing.

714
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,880
Just say it.

715
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
Don't speak in code.

716
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm wondering how come
such a good girl as you

717
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,560
would take a fancy to

718
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,240
such a man as Fan?

719
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
Can you stop it?

720
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,160
I'm telling the truth.

721
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,000
I think you're a good girl. You...

722
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,520
You should find a good man.

723
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,880
Are you mad at me again?

724
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,280
Why am I mad?

725
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,320
Do you know how to chat?

726
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
I never expect you
to be so exasperating.

727
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,840
I only asked you to find a good man.

728
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,760
What did I do wrong?

729
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,680
Don't you want a good job?

730
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,560
Does your wish matter?

731
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,400
Apples and oranges.

732
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm talking about you.

733
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,680
I think such a girl as you...

734
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
What kind of girl I am?

735
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,520
What kind of girl I am?

736
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,560
At my best age,

737
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,440
I couldn't lift my head
with the title of reactionary.

738
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,800
Now years have passed

739
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,880
and I'm no longer young,

740
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,720
People my age all have children.

741
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,160
What kind of girl I am? Tell me.

742
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,440
What kind of man should I find?

743
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,040
Yanqiu, Yanqiu.

744
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,960
I didn't mean to provoke you.

745
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,560
I just think you're a good girl.

746
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
You deserve a better man.

747
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Alright.

748
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,880
I can't do sweet talk.

749
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,840
Let's pretend I didn't say anything.

750
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,840
I was wrong. I was wrong.

751
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm not mad.

752
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,360
I have to go to work.

753
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,280
I think I'm really a good girl

754
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
and I'll find a good man.

755
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,960
You'll find a good job, too.

756
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,860
(Left face!)

757
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,920
Guohua.

758
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,640
Hongling.

759
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
How is it going with your
material collecting

760
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,040
in our company?

761
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,480
It's going well.

762
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,880
These days are productive.

763
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,520
Good.

764
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,200
Unfortunately,

765
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,040
the training of the recruits has ended.

766
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,960
You're about to
return to the troupe soon.

767
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,480
Let's take a walk.

768
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,680
I can see Chunsheng

769
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,040
working hard on the
five-kilometer yomp lately.

770
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,280
I heard he asked you to
put it back in the competition.

771
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
He shouldn't have troubled you.

772
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,880
No.

773
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,160
I made the decision

774
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,080
mostly for business reasons.

775
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,480
No pressure.

776
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
Thanks, Guohua.

777
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,360
I was worried that
this would happen someday.

778
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,480
Chunsheng is competent.

779
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
But he is too stubborn.

780
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,880
He's stiff-necked.

781
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,040
You're his platoon leader.

782
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Please put up with him.

783
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,600
I thank you on behalf of him.

784
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,640
Hongling,

785
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,000
it's late.

786
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,480
Why haven't you slept yet?
