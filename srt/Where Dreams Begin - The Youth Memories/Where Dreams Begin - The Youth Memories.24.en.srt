3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
Hey, don't go.

4
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,280
Xiao Chunsheng.

5
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,800
Such an honorable return.

6
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,280
You're indeed the combat hero.

7
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Look at this cripple.

8
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,520
Look at this cripple.

9
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Look.

10
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,600
What a hardy guy!

11
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,840
Hurt your vital parts, huh?

12
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,240
Tell me.

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
What?

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,160
You came back alone?

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,320
He Hongling must have

16
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
dumped you, right?

17
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,080
She can't be with your best buddy,

18
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,480
who's a leader there, can she?

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,520
If she is,

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
she has just

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
cuckolded you, huh?

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Who do you think you're teasing?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Go away!

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Still playing tough, huh?

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Let go of me!

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
How could you still play tough?

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,640
You...

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Hands off me!

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
Screw you!

30
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,040
Remember to come to me.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
And of course,

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
under the condition

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
that you can walk to me.

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
Bah.

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
Chunsheng.

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Chunsheng,

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,040
what happened?

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,520
I told you not to drink so much.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,800
Come on.

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
Look how drunk you are!

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,640
Chunsheng.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,600
Chunsheng.

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,840
What happened?

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,760
How did you fall?

45
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,160
Come on.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I told you not to drink that much!

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
Look at you.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
I told you he should
always be accompanied.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,240
Are you OK?

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,920
- Are you all right?
- Chunsheng, how did you fall?

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Chunsheng.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,960
Are you OK?

53
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,120
Chunsheng.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,960
Xiaomei,

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,680
that day,

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
when we were in the hospital,

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I heard what the doctor said.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,520
Actually,

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Hongjun

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
offered a great job.

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm a disabled guy, huh?

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
If I can

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,280
get a job in logistics,

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,240
I would thank God.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,360
Chunsheng,

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,320
don't think like that.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,160
I will cure you.

68
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,240
Xiaomei,

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,520
you know what?

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
In the beginning,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,840
you shouldn't have said that to me.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,080
You shouldn't have let me

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,760
have impractical illusion

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
that I can get back on my feet.

75
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,920
After all,

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
when you're working so hard

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
toward something

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
and when you hopefully think

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,800
you're approaching that goal,

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
someone suddenly pops out

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
and tells you

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,280
you actually remain unchanged

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,120
and haven't made even a little progress.

84
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,800
Nothing hurts me more like this.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Chunsheng,

86
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
remaining unchanged is

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
at least better than giving up.

88
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,120
Tong Xiaomei,

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
can you not understand?

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,200
I beg you, OK?

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,520
I beg you!

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,640
Stop wasting any time

93
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
on a cripple like me,

94
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,200
OK?

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,760
Chunsheng.

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,900
- Chunsheng.
- Chunsheng.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,240
- Xiaomei!
- Xiaomei!

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,920
Xiaomei.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,240
Xiaomei.

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,360
What's wrong with you?

101
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Why did you lose your temper?

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
You two are to blame!

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,200
You insisted on drinking!

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,680
It's just your fault.

105
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,880
(Tong Xiaomei left.)

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,440
(Maybe she'll never come back.)

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
(What Xiao Chunsheng said that day)

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,360
(must have stung that kind girl.)

109
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
(In the following unknown journey,)

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,360
(he would be really all alone.)

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,720
(Thinking of this)

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
(made Xiao Chunsheng extremely grieved.)

113
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,780
(Yingbin Restaurant)

114
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
Be careful not to burn yourself.

115
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,800
Tian, enjoy the tea.

116
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
OK, Laowu. Get back to your business.

117
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,600
All right.

118
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,680
Tian.

119
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Will he not come?

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,040
We surrendered big profits.

121
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,480
He has no reason to reject it.

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
Tian, here we meet again.

123
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,880
Hi, Sange.

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,680
Sange, how are you doing lately?

125
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,320
Good.

126
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
My friend told me

127
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,200
you wanted to talk business.

128
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,160
Yes.

129
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Here's the thing.

130
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
I...

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
I have some FECs.

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,960
I want to sell them to you

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,920
at the listed exchange rate.

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
How much do you have?

135
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,880
5,000.

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
Then you'll lose a lot.

137
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,880
Better than wasting it, right?

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
We're not doing business
for the first time.

139
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
You know what a man I am.

140
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,640
And it's not the last time.

141
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
I'll still count on you.

142
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,760
Sange,

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
I heard

144
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,280
it wasn't your decision

145
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
to reject my FECs, huh?

146
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
How shall I put it?

147
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,760
I rejected your FECs

148
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
for the sake of my friend.

149
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,840
Many years ago, I owed him a favor.

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
But don't worry, Tian.

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
We're old friends

152
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
and I won't give you a hard time.

153
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Between us,

154
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,960
business is business.

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Excuse me.

156
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,560
You stay for a while.

157
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,440
Did he...

158
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,720
Did he arrange this?

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,640
Sange said

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,720
he couldn't buy your FECs.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Why not?

162
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Tian,

163
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
I've heard about you.

164
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,280
And I respect you.

165
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Let me say this.

166
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Sell the FECs

167
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
you have immediately.

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Don't care about the price.

169
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,600
If anyone wants to buy them,

170
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,400
sell them.

171
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,520
I don't think

172
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,280
it's only Li Shangyou's trick.

173
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,960
And Sange said

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
he just returned a favor to Li Shangyou.

175
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,720
After that, business is business.

176
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
I met Sange only once.

177
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
But I don't think

178
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,800
he's a flip-flopper.

179
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,920
How about this?

180
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll go ask Hongjun and Ye Fang.

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,280
They're well-informed.

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,560
Let's see if we fail to know

183
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,640
about some new changes.

184
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,080
Tian,

185
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,040
any idea about the FECs?

186
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
I sent Heizi to Tianjin

187
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
to see if anyone would buy them.

188
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,680
Keep an eye on Li Shangyou.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,520
Doing business is so troublesome.

190
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,880
OK.

191
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,520
I get it.

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Let's have dinner when you're back.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,320
I sent a friend to ask about it.

194
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,480
No hint about the FECs.

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,160
But this year's policy focuses

196
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
on cracking down on speculations.

197
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,680
Ask them to be very careful.

198
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,080
Losing money would be better

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,440
than going to jail, right?

200
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,520
But it's thousands of bucks.

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,560
Enough for a family's living cost
over a dozen years.

202
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Even if Tian can give up,

203
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,520
his man wouldn't agree.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,440
I can see he's been

205
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,400
trying so hard

206
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,640
to do some big business.

207
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,000
I guess it's hard to convince him.

208
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,960
That's what you have to do.

209
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,000
Others may fail to convince him,

210
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,840
but you won't.

211
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,080
Because you have enough prestige.

212
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,440
Fang,

213
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,680
since when have you
thought so highly of me?

214
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,320
Anyway, Tian learned his lesson.

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He must be knowing how far to go.

216
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,800
Go check if Yanqiu

217
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,920
has come for Chunsheng.

218
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,280
He's going to the sanatorium at ten.

219
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,920
He shouldn't be late.

220
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,600
It's half past nine. He won't be late.

221
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,960
Just go as you're told.

222
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,360
Fine. I'll go have a look.

223
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Chunsheng, I should go.

224
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,240
How's Xiaomei doing lately?

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
You don't know?

226
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
She told me

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,040
her father

228
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
got her a job in the hospital

229
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,760
and she still wanted to be a doctor.

230
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Her family doesn't own the hospitals.

231
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,320
How can she get a job

232
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
just as she wishes?

233
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
You always trust whatever she says,

234
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,600
even without thinking.

235
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,160
She told me

236
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
she stayed in Beijing

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
because her parents wanted that.

238
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
So, it was for me?

239
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
Or who else?

240
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,600
I've never seen
such a stubborn girl as her

241
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,760
and I've never seen
such a dumb man as you.

242
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
If you had cared even a little bit,

243
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,920
you would have felt something wrong.

244
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,880
Do you really think

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,600
she only takes you as a friend?

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,480
Xiao Chunsheng,

247
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,920
don't be that ungrateful.

248
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
Let me be frank with you.

249
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
She had a crush on you in the beginning.

250
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,960
She has never loved my brother.

251
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,160
And my brother
isn't good enough for her.

252
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,400
Only an idealist like you,

253
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
who always thinks he can

254
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,880
blow himself up for his country,

255
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,040
can attract her.

256
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,400
When He Hongling wanted
to join the Art Troupe,

257
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,200
Xiaomei gave her the quota

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,560
just to make you stay together.

259
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Even when she knew
you had to leave the army,

260
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
she talked to He Hongling,

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
asking her to wait for you.

262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,360
And this time,

263
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
your girlfriend He Hongling

264
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,200
didn't want to give up her promotion

265
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,160
and bright future.

266
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,520
What about Xiaomei?

267
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
She's only your friend.

268
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,640
But she gave up the further education

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,320
to be a doctor and came back with you.

270
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,680
Xiao Chunsheng,

271
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,000
sometimes I don't know

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
if you're really dumb or if you play it.

273
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,480
Why can't you understand

274
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,880
her feelings for you?

275
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,600
What about you?

276
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,000
Didn't you see?

277
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
I also like a girl.

278
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,520
Now, I've found her.

279
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,080
Best wishes to you, then.

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,840
You're not a loser.

281
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,720
You're a hero.

282
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
A real hero.

283
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
After you have the operation in Beijing,

284
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
you'll get back on your feet.

285
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,720
Then you're still what you used to be.

286
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,520
Please help me say thank you to her.

287
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,760
And sorry.

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,160
I should have known.

289
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
Maybe I knew it.

290
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,830
I just didn't want to admit it.

291
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,440
Sometimes, I'm weak

292
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,920
and I need someone around.

293
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,200
She doesn't need to do anything else.

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,240
Just staying around me

295
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,920
makes me feel I still have hope.

296
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,160
What about her feelings?

297
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,440
You know what I'm talking about.

298
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,000
What's Xiaomei doing now?

299
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,080
Her parents

300
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,560
are making her review
for the college entrance exam.

301
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,720
It's good.

302
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,880
Good.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't tell me

304
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,760
you're not good enough for her.

305
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,560
But it's true.

306
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,840
You're trashing her feelings for you.

307
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
She doesn't love you

308
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,040
like a girl adores a hero

309
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,640
in a blind and indecent way.

310
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,000
She finds some of herself in you

311
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
that will never be defeated by problems,

312
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,160
never give in to reality,

313
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
and will always pursue the dream.

314
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,360
Chunsheng,

315
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,160
here comes the car.

316
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Got it.

317
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Think carefully about it.

318
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
Don't let her down.

319
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,580
(Unit One)

320
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello, Xiaomei.

321
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,840
Oh, Heizi. What's up?

322
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,160
What? What did you say?

323
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
Xiaomei is in trouble?

324
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Come on, girl.

325
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
You have ways to buy it

326
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,200
and book another one, OK?

327
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,680
I'm really in urgent need of this!

328
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,480
Shangyou, other goods were shipped.

329
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,960
We still have this much.

330
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,040
Girl,

331
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
I take back what I just cursed

332
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,400
about Xiao Chunsheng.

333
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,440
And I apologize to you.

334
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
As long as you sell it,

335
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,880
I will give you

336
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,880
another 3,000 yuan,

337
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,040
as a cash gift

338
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
for your wedding with Xiao Chunsheng.

339
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,280
Deal?

340
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:52,880
Laosi,

341
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,760
count the cash.

342
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,280
Girl,

343
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,600
take this.

344
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,600
Come on.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Take this.

346
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,560
Here.

347
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Don't touch her. Don't.

348
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,360
Here.

349
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Listen, just take the money.

350
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,280
Take it.

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,400
Take it.

352
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,520
What did you do?

353
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,520
You want it the hard way, right?

354
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,720
Your father is just

355
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,680
a commander, right?

356
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,200
But in a fight,

357
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm not afraid of him!

358
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,360
Carry it away!

359
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,760
Get up. Don't trouble us.

360
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Go. Go away.

361
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
Hurry!

362
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Look. How rude they are!

363
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,080
Hands off her!

364
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you doing here?

365
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,200
What?

366
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,400
Li Shangyou,

367
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,520
someone's family
shall never be involved.

368
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,760
You're breaking the rules.

369
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,040
What year is it now?

370
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,680
Still rules?

371
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,520
Tell me.

372
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,600
Can rules

373
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
make money for you?

374
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,320
Besides,

375
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,080
why must we

376
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,840
obey a cripple's rules?

377
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, it's you, Qian Tian,
who terrorized Beixinqiao.

378
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,960
What, man?

379
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,240
Out of jail?

380
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Why didn't you tell us?

381
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,560
We could have given you a welcome party.

382
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,040
Li Shangyou,

383
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,440
we don't want

384
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,800
to argue with you.

385
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,560
This instrument is very important to us,

386
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,800
concerning our future.

387
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
And we bought this instrument.

388
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
It's not yours.

389
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
If my hand

390
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,440
could recover,

391
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
a negotiation would be possible.

392
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,920
How about you cripple your hand, too?

393
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,320
Li Shangyou,

394
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
you just said
no one still obeyed the rules.

395
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,520
Let me tell you this.

396
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,240
Now, you not only have to obey the rules,

397
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
but also abide by the laws.

398
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,160
You know what?

399
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,480
I called the police.

400
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,360
They're arriving in half an hour.

401
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,800
If you know what's good,
leave immediately!

402
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,800
Oh, Heizi.

403
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
Hasn't Xiaohui

404
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,920
dumped you yet?

405
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,520
After all these years,

406
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm still thinking about her.

407
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,640
I...

408
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Chunsheng!

409
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,120
What are you doing?

410
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,120
Let go of it!

411
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,920
Xiaomei!

412
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,280
Xiaomei!

413
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,440
Xiaomei!

414
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,600
Xiaomei!

415
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,320
Let go of it!

416
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,840
Chunsheng!

417
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,360
Let go of it!

418
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,360
Xiaomei.

419
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,480
Are you OK?

420
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,800
Beat them!

421
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,880
What are you doing? Stop!

422
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,760
- Stop!
- Stop!

423
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,400
Freeze, all of you!

424
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,840
Freeze!

425
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,760
Freeze!

426
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,600
Go!

427
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,400
Take them away.

428
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,120
Don't struggle!

429
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,600
Don't struggle!

430
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,080
- Go!
- Go!

431
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,530
- Go!
- Go!

432
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,150
Go away.

433
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,160
Xiaomei,

434
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,160
are you OK?

435
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,320
Are you hurt?

436
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,200
Come on.

437
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,840
Say something.

438
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,840
Xiaomei,

439
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,680
did you see that?

440
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
I just...

441
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,440
I just stood up, right?

442
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
And I walked, right?

443
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,520
You didn't walk.

444
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,960
You fell.

445
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,200
You just recovered.

446
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
Why did you play the hero?

447
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Come on. Don't cry.

448
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,320
Be... Be gentle.

449
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,000
It's OK.

450
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
It's OK.

451
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,360
It's all over.

452
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,160
(For insulting the veteran
several times,)

453
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,840
(Li Shangyou and his man were put
under 15-day administrative detention.)

454
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,120
It hurts. It hurts.

455
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,680
Be... Be gentle.

456
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,960
I haven't seen you for a short while

457
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
but now you can stand up.

458
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,360
Well done, Comrade Xiao Chunsheng.

459
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
Even when you were away, Dr. Tong,

460
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,360
I couldn't slacken at home.

461
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,720
I shouldn't waste

462
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,600
your hard work over the days, right?

463
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,120
Then these days,

464
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,120
I'll have to treat you.

465
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,360
Be gentle.

466
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,400
Thank you.

467
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,640
I should say thank you, too.

468
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Without you,

469
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
their fists

470
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,600
would have landed on me.

471
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,760
It's no big deal.

472
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
I'm a man.

473
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
How could I let a woman get hurt?

474
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,280
What's so funny?

475
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,320
Now you know you're a man, huh?

476
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,120
Then who said,

477
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,680
"I'm a cripple.

478
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Leave me alone."

479
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,240
Why do you have such a good memory?

480
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,040
Don't you remember

481
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,800
what Confucius said?

482
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
"Women are hard to deal with."

483
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,160
I've put down

484
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,160
what you said about me.

485
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,280
Forget what I said last time.

486
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,880
I...

487
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,680
I said something I didn't really mean.

488
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
Actually, I'm eager to be with you.

489
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
For the rest of my life.

490
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,040
Did you hear what I just said?

491
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,440
It hurts.

492
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Be gentle.

493
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
I did.

494
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,160
Xiaomei,

495
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,160
you said something to me

496
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,120
and I thought about it.

497
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,520
You made sense.

498
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,000
I should embrace reality.

499
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,280
Even if

500
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
I can't walk as well as before,

501
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
I have no problem

502
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,200
living a normal life.

503
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,480
I can't return to the army

504
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,720
and I've accepted it.

505
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
Don't worry.

506
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,280
The electromagnetic instrument
has been delivered.

507
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,920
You'll recover soon.

508
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,360
(During his rehabilitation,)

509
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,080
(Chunsheng was cared for and helped)

510
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,160
(by leaders in the army
and relevant civil authorities.)

511
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,760
(Encouraged by the Party Organization,)

512
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,400
(he was determined
to get back on his feet soon.)

513
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,560
Breathe properly.

514
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Dr. Tong,

515
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,640
you have eyes on your back?

516
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,080
All doctors

517
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,520
have a 360-degree monitoring function.

518
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,320
Don't you know?

519
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,320
How do you feel?

520
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,530
♪It sparkles in the dream too♪

521

were all arrested.

it was really smart of you.

567

You predicted this.

568
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,280
If you hadn't restrained us,

569

you and I would be in jail, too.

570
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,960
Think about it.

571
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,080
When we can't do such dealings,

572
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,120
what else can we do?

573
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,400
Let me think.

574
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,360

and Crack Down on Speculations)

584
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,080
Actually, I don't think

585
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,720
this is a bad thing.

586
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
From your previous business,

587
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,960
you made quick money.

588
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,520
But that won't last long.

589
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Anyway,

590
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,320
you sell FECs

591
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,680
or bring some goods

592
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,360
back from Guangzhou or Hong Kong,

593
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,120
you just money the difference for legwork.

594
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,200
Think about it.

595
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,720
If transportation improves,

596
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,960
goods from other cities

597
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,440
can come directly to Beijing.

598

And you can no longer

599
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,200
do this business.

600
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,520
And based on the overall situation,

601
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
I think it's very necessary

602
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,640
to crack down on speculations.

603
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,680
Think.

604
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,000
If everyone

605
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
does speculations

606
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,360
and makes quick money,

607
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,840
who would still focus on production?

608
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,720
In the long run,

609
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,920
our nation would be in a mess.

610
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,800

What's your next plan, then?

614
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,920
Still thinking about it.

615
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,680
The other day, I read from the newspaper

616
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,320
about...

617
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,560
About a small store

618
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,560
in foreign countries.

619
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,560
It sells food, daily supplies,

620
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,760
and chief daily necessities.

621
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
Just everything you want.

622
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,360
Isn't it like the old

623
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,960
supply and marketing cooperatives?

624
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
Not at all.

625
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,360
That store opens 24 hours a day.

626
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,600
Whenever you want to buy something,

627
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,480
you can buy it.

628
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,040
Foreigners are too busy

629
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
to make breakfast.

630
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
They all buy breakfast there.

631
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,960
Good idea.

632
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,440
Where do you want to open it?

633
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,320
Where else can I go?

634
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,440
Xidan, of course.

635
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,120
Many tourists go there,
especially at weekends.

636
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,440
It's always crowded.

637
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,120
According to your description,

638
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,640
that store serves common people, right?

639
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,920
If you open it in Xidan,

640
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,880
the rent will be high

641
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,000
and people who go shopping there

642
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,040
don't usually buy daily necessities.

643
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Where do you recommend, then?

644
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,320
You have to go out and check around

645
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
before you pick a place.

646
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,120
But I think

647
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,560
a high-traffic area in the community

648
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,520
would be better.

649
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,120

I'm waiting to have a nephew.

654

Chairman Mao wanted to be a teacher?

663

became great pioneers
of national salvation.

build a harmonious world,

isn't the one and only.

After graduation, I'll be 29.

693
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,840
A new doctor

694
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,920
at the age of 29

695
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,280
who has just graduated...

696
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,160
I don't feel disgraced or what.

697
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:48,960
I know.

698
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
I just have doubts.

699
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,960
I'm not sure

700
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,160
if it's worth spending five years

701
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,080
learning from scratch.

702
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,840
More than five years, maybe.

703
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,080
After all, from a new doctor

704
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,040
to a totally independent doctor,

705
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,840
a dozen years may be required.

706
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,000
By then, I'll be in my forties.

707
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,480
I don't mean to boast,

708
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,000
but I've learned a lot of knowledge

709
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,400
in the hospital.

710
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,160
I've also read about

711
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,040
many courses and research

712
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
in foreign periodicals.

713
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,400
When I accompanied you in rehabilitation,

714
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,520
I just got to know
about Rehabilitation Therapy.

715
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,960
I read some papers, too.

716
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,360
I found

717
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,360
this discipline was just started

718
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
not only in China,
but also in foreign countries.

719
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,080
As early as 1960,

720
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,560
Rehabilitation International was built.

721
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,040
Rehabilitation Therapy

722
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
also became an independent discipline.

723
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,160
But it's still affiliated to medicine.

724
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,240
And it's even a base camp

725
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,960
for unsolved medical problems.

726
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,880
Conditions are worse in China.

727
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,800
We only have some

728
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,680
traditional treatments

729
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,720
such as acupuncture and cupping.

730
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,000
Then, it's a discipline of experience.

731
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,160
It even has few theories.

732
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,880
I enjoy listening to this.

733
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,600
So, I want to try this.

734
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,160
I'm qualified to take this exam now.

735
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,600
(Xinsheng Rehabilitation Sanatorium)
After I pass it, I'll get a job.

736
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,600
The jobs gap in this industry

737
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,520
can be big.

738
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,000
Now, I realize something.

739
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,880
I used to say

740
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
doctors and nurses were the same.

741
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
But I insisted on being a doctor.

742
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,560
More or less,

743
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,240
I despised Care Medicine.

744
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,640
But in recent months,

745
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,920
we've been to the rehabilitation center

746
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,640
and met so many patients.

747
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,360
I've finally realized

748
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,800
that all medical disciplines
serve the people

749
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,960
and the patients.

750
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,680
Nothing makes them different.

751
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,880
All jobs are glorious, too.

752
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,720
So,

753
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm your first patient

754
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,200
having his rehabilitation, right?
