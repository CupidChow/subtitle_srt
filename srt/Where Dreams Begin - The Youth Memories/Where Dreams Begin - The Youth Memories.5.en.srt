=Episode 5=

3
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,660
Heizi, Xiao Chunsheng is out.

4
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,580
He went out early in the morning.

5
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,820
Where did he go?

6
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,340
I heard that he was going to
see Liang Dong.

7
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,180
He did find a good place to go.

8
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,940
Heizi,

9
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,100
if you want to fix Xiao Chunsheng,

10
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,380
I have an idea.

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,380
Is your information solid?

12
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,380
Absolutely.

13
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,780
Every other week, Sunday.

14
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,740
Never missed once.

15
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,620
That's right. Tian mentioned this.

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,540
Really?

17
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,140
Tell me more about it.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,740
In the early hours of Sunday morning,

19
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,260
he usually heads for Yanqing
riding his bike.

20
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,140
To go to Yanqing, after leaving
the compound he lives in,

21
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,460
he has to pass through Kuliushu Street.

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,220
That street is almost empty
early in the morning.

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,860
What day is today?

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,580
Saturday.

25
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
It is workable.

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,060
What if Tian finds it out?

27
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,380
How can we let him know this?

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,420
I don't believe that

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,820
Tian will fall out with Heizi

30
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,100
for Xiao Chunsheng's sake.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,340
Tian thinks highly of Xiao Chunsheng.

32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,020
He even...

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,060
Even what?

34
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,300
I dare not say it.

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,860
Why are you afraid to say it?

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,180
He even let Xiao Chunsheng
have the girl he fancies, right?

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
I just can't understand.

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,780
Heizi, we must give vent to our anger.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,420
Yes, we must.

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,500
That's what we'll do.

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,020
Let's go.

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,460
Dad,

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,700
you are at home?

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,220
Guohua,

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,300
hurry to eat. After eating,

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,180
you'll go to see Commander Tong
with your mom.

47
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,820
Go to your room

48
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,940
to change your clothes

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,540
and comb your hair.

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,260
OK.

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,700
Oh, one more thing.

52
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,020
Mr. Xiao's political appraisal result
is about to come out.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,340
If the result is good,

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,500
you and Chunsheng
can enlist as new soldiers.

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,700
Really?

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,220
That will be great!

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,500
Chunsheng,

58
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,340
don't push yourself too hard.

59
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,860
Drink some water and take a break.

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,940
Thank you, Dong.

61
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,620
Speaking of your joining the army,
how is it going?

62
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
Mr. Ye said that

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,380
the political appraisal result
will come out in a couple of days.

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,900
There will be no problem this time.

65
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,100
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,180
No problem with what?

67
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,940
Chunsheng is going to join the army.

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,780
Really?

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,100
It's great news.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,420
Now you can have your wish fulfilled.

71
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,300
How is it between you and Hongling?

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,180
Tian, do you have any immediate plans?

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,780
Since you will join the army,

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,500
I will leave this place, too.

75
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,860
I have thought it through.

76
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,420
I have lived in Beijing since I was born.

77
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,300
I am so familiar with every part of it.

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,740
I found it boring.

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,810
The guys coming back from Guangzhou said

80
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,460
there were lots of fresh things
in that city.

81
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
So, this city

82
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,580
is not big enough for you.

83
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
It's not like that, Dong.

84
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,780
I just want to go out to see the world.

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,020
You must have got something planned.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,660
I am an open book in front of you.

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,980
From now on,

88
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,340
you'll try to be a general in the army

89
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,180
while I will try my luck

90
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,900
in this big world.

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,860
All right, you go ahead.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,860
I will be off.

93
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,380
Why are you leaving? I just arrived.

94
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,500
I will go home and read books.

95
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,020
Dong, take this back.

96
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,300
I gotta go.

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,980
Take care.

98
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,460
See you.

99
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,500
Let's go have some tea.

100
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,100
Xiaomei, why are you here?

101
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,020
I have something to tell you.

102
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,420
One, two, three, four!

103
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,380
Thank you for coming to tell me this.

104
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,620
Xiao Chunsheng,

105
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,300
don't go there on Sunday.
Just go some other time.

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,660
One, two, three, four!

107
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,900
You'll still go,

108
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,620
won't you?

109
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,140
Heizi has had a problem with me

110
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,740
for quite some time.

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,420
Besides,

112
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,860
since there is a problem,

113
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,300
I will have to solve it.

114
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,980
How come you came across
Heizi and his men

115
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,020
at this time of the day?

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,420
I just ran into them.

117
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,460
By the way,

118
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,780
I heard Ye Fang say

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,900
Mrs. Ye will set you up with Guohua.

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,860
Guohua is a nice guy,

121
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,340
except that...

122
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,060
Except for what you saw
in Shichahai that day.

123
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,100
Guohua is having a crush on
another girl.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,980
How about you?

125
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,020
Me?

126
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,140
Didn't you see it that day?

127
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
I also fancy a girl.

128
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,540
Now I have found her.

129
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,220
What does the girl look like?

130
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,180
She has long hair and big eyes.

131
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,140
Her smile is very pretty.

132
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,740
Her eyes look like the crescent moon
when she smiles.

133
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,140
It makes her look so beautiful.

134
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,020
Then I wish you two happiness.

135
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,420
(Be united for greater victories)

136
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,500
It hasn't been long.
Now you are already a grown-up man.

137
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,940
You are so tall and handsome.

138
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,700
Where is Xiaomei?

139
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,540
Xiaomei...

140
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,060
In the morning,

141
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,300
I sent her to her aunt's home
to deliver something.

142
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,540
She should have been back.

143
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
I guess

144
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,620
because she hasn't seen her aunt
for quite a while,

145
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
she wants to stay a bit longer.

146
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,180
She is close to her aunt.

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes, that's right.

148
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,500
How old is Guohua this year?

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,140
He is two years older than Xiaomei.

150
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,660
Then why haven't you joined the army?

151
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,100
Do you have any other plans?

152
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,540
What other plans can he have?

153
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,220
He will leave
in the second half of the year.

154
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,220
Now his father

155
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,100
is urging him to review his learning,

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,460
telling him to lay
a solid foundation of literacy.

157
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,820
This will make it easier for him
to pass the upcoming test.

158
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,020
I said he should leave first

159
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,540
to accept training and tests in the army.

160
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,220
Yes, right.

161
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,180
It's good to join the army early.

162
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,140
It can make him a better man.

163
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,820
Look.

164
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,540
Xiaomei, you are back.

165
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,500
Why have you stayed in your aunt's home
for so long?

166
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,460
Hurry to meet our guests.

167
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,900
Come on.

168
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,860
- Hurry to have a look.
- Hurry up.

169
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,060
Hello, Mrs. Ye.

170
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,530
Xiaomei.

171
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,860
How about

172
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,010
we go to my room and sit down?

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,900
Just go.

174
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,180
Mrs. Tong, excuse me.

175
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,220
Go. Go quickly.

176
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,260
Young people have nothing to say to us.

177
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
We should let them chat as they like.

178
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,900
Yes, just let them chat.

179
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
Would you like some water?

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Xiaomei, to be honest, I...

181
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,660
Guohua, we are not right for each other.

182
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,580
I was also in Shichahai back then.

183
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,860
I found that you fancied the girl
who was skating,

184
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,020
He Hongling.

185
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,020
Our parents arranged this date.

186
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
I don't want to worry them,

187
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,820
so I asked you to come here
to clear the air.

188
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,220
Don't feel pressured.

189
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,220
Xiaomei, well,

190
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,220
thank you.

191
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,460
(Notes on Nursing

192
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,180
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

193
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,100
You don't have to thank me.

194
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,220
I am doing this for my own sake.

195
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,540
Well, I have something to tell you.

196
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,540
These two kids.

197
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,300
Look at him.

198
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,420
Mr. Tong and Mrs. Tong,

199
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I have something urgent to attend to.
I gotta go.

200
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,860
I will come to visit you another day.

201
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,900
Mom, I will be off.

202
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,660
What is the urgent matter?

203
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,180
Why is it so important?

204
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,340
It is a matter of life and death.

205
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,740
It's all right. Just let him go.

206
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,340
It's not right. I will go check.

207
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,620
I have got the meal ready.

208
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,860
I won't have it.

209
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,620
- Then you...
- You...

210
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,220
- I am leaving. See you.
- See you.

211
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,260
- Take care.
- Come again. Take care.

212
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,540
Well, everything was fine just now.

213
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,700
What happened?

214
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,940
Mom, I am not angry.

215
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,340
He really needed to go.

216
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
And I told him to leave.

217
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,940
Mom, it's impossible
that we'll get involved romantically.

218
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,860
He has a crush on another girl.

219
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,420
Stop making such arrangements
in the days to come.

220
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,580
He has a crush on another girl.

221
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,660
Look at you. What have you done?

222
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,540
He fancies another girl.

223
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,980
How could you fix him up with Xiaomei?

224
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,300
His mom didn't tell me about that.

225
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,620
What a disgrace!

226
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,620
(Be united for greater victories)

227
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,340
A straight. Six, seven, eight. Who?

228
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,180
- Deal.
- Will you take it?

229
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,780
Chunsheng.

230
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,340
I will do it.

231
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,780
Guohua, what has brought you here?

232
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,580
Make room for me.

233
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,180
You are gasping.

234
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,580
Why are you gasping?

235
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,700
Heizi is going to ambush you.

236
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,260
What?

237
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,700
Who told you this?

238
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,260
Was it Tong Xiaomei?

239
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Um, Chunsheng,

240
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,580
what is the matter?

241
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
Early in the morning tomorrow,
in Kuliushu Street,

242
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,420
while I am on my way to Xizhimen
to catch the early train,

243
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,860
Heizi will lead his men in ambushing me.

244
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,700
Ambush you?

245
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
We will go head-to-head with them.

246
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,780
What exactly do they want?

247
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,100
OK. Be seated.

248
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,820
Sit down.

249
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,020
Now that you know, you're still going?

250
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,620
I can't let them wait in vain.

251
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,220
Those gangsters.

252
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,500
I will make this clear first.

253
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,780
You won't be needed
in the fight tomorrow.

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,020
Don't worry. Even if the sky falls down,

255
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
I will bring the braised pork

256
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,620
to my dad.

257
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,500
Look, tomorrow, you and Hongling

258
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,580
will take a detour to get to the station

259
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,020
and go to Yanqing to visit my dad.

260
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,380
How can we let that happen?

261
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,500
I am more or less responsible for this.

262
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,140
Xiaoliu,

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,420
you will ask Yanqiu to go to Yanqing.

264
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,260
I will go with you.

265
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,260
Forget about it.

266
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,180
Otherwise, Ye Fang will blame me later.

267
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,140
Just ignore her.

268
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,260
Chunsheng, I will go with you.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,580
Right. You can't go alone.

270
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,260
Right.

271
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,060
Enough.

272
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
Heizi is not a bad guy.

273
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,940
He is just a bit stubborn.

274
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,540
Moreover, he is doing this for Tian.

275
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,460
Thus, I'll try to smooth things over.

276
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,700
Follow my instructions
and play it by ear tomorrow.

277
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,180
Heizi,

278
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,980
why are you here early in the morning?

279
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,140
I am waiting for you.

280
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,220
OK. I got it.

281
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,380
Wait a minute.

282
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,660
Can I say something?

283
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
OK, go ahead.

284
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,180
Since Tian and I met,

285
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,980
there might have been occasions

286
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,340
when I did something wrong

287
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,020
or displeased him,

288
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,100
making you feel humiliated.

289
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
If so, I will take responsibility.

290
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,860
Today, in front of all of you,

291
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,100
I will apologize.

292
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,660
Then let's bury the hatchet.

293
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,820
All right?

294
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,340
You are getting cold feet?

295
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,820
Yes, I admit it.

296
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,540
It is too late.

297
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Everyone in the city knows

298
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,460
that He Hongling hangs out with Qi Tian.

299
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,980
Heizi,

300
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,420
what you said is meaningless.

301
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,540
Tian is also my friend.

302
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,220
He is a loyal and sensible man.

303
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,860
He is not a villain or a bully.

304
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,420
We have lived in the new society
for many years, right?

305
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,180
Women have been liberated.
They can love any men who love them.

306
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,700
He Hongling has a mind of her own.

307
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,540
Nobody can force her.

308
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Stop before going too far.

309
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,340
Take your men and leave.

310
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,100
If Tian is dissatisfied with me,

311
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
he will come to get at me himself.

312
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,580
Don't play such a trick on me.

313
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,740
Don't any of you dare to move!

314
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,460
What can you do to me?

315
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,980
Ye Guohua, you have no say in this.

316
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,100
What do you mean?

317
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,980
You should look at yourself
to know your place.

318
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Who do you think you are?

319
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,140
Even Tian said something.

320
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,540
What did he say about you?

321
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,860
He said you were a lackey
following Xiao Chunsheng around.

322
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,140
Heizi!

323
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Heizi!

324
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,940
Heizi!

325
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,380
- Heizi!
- Bro!

326
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,780
Bro!

327
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,380
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

328
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,140
Ye Fang,

329
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,460
a phone call for you.

330
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,980
Hello.

331
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,740
I... I got it.

332
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,500
My younger sister agreed.

333
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,620
Great!

334
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,100
- Let's go see Hongjun first.
- Let's go.

335
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,660
It's a deal.

336
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,940
Chunsheng, I won't go anywhere.

337
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,290
Don't act unreasonably.

338
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,050
Even if Heizi doesn't give you trouble,

339
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,180
Qi Tian won't let you off.

340
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,260
I will go tell your mom.

341
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,620
Let's think of a safe plan.

342
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,380
Chunsheng,

343
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,420
but... where should I go?

344
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,260
Baoding.

345
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,140
Baoding?

346
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,940
It's my hometown.

347
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,900
There is an old house that is empty.

348
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,540
I have talked with Ye Fang.

349
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,820
She will ask for leave in a while

350
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
to clean up the house for you.

351
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,660
If you have any need after arriving,

352
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
she will take care of you.

353
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,220
Is this appropriate?

354
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,100
What is inappropriate?

355
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,540
My sister is sharp-tongued,

356
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
but she is kindhearted.

357
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,700
In addition,

358
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
in her opinion, you have always been

359
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
a good guy, right?

360
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,540
She is always saying that among us,

361
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,580
you are the only one
that is not incurable.

362
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,780
We'll have to count on her to save you
this time.

363
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,060
Leave now.

364
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,700
I will ask my sister to pack your things

365
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,580
and then send them to you.

366
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,220
Guohua, Xiaoliu,

367
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,700
you guys, go to the station
to see Hongjun off.

368
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,580
Why won't you join us?

369
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,060
I will go to the hospital to visit Heizi.

370
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,580
Qi Tian also wants me to go there.

371
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,900
Chunsheng, you can't go there.

372
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,820
- Right.
- You can't go, Chunsheng.

373
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,140
I have to.

374
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,260
Chunsheng, it is too dangerous.

375
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Let's all go with you.

376
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,340
Yes. At least, you can't go there alone.

377
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,380
If I don't go there alone

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,620
and bring my mates with me,

379
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,460
what will be my intention?
To start another fight?

380
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,020
It is the hospital.

381
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,780
Don't worry.

382
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
I know what to do.

383
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,100
If Qi Tian wants to kill me,

384
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,020
he won't see me in the hospital.

385
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,140
Moreover,

386
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,140
I have to give an explanation for this

387
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,540
and I can't avoid facing it.

388
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,140
Here,

389
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,860
we chipped in. Take it.

390
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,020
Chunsheng.

391
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
Stop pulling the long face.

392
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,340
It is a happy thing

393
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,100
to see Ye Fang.

394
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,020
All right, go.

395
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,980
Drink some water.

396
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,140
Heizi.

397
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,700
What are you here for?

398
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,860
Xiaohui,

399
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,020
we raked together this sum of money
for medical services.

400
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,700
Take it.

401
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,580
If it is not enough, let me know.

402
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,340
Heizi, Chunsheng is here to visit you.

403
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,580
Heizi, you are my mate.

404
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,220
So is Chunsheng.

405
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,580
Normally, we should die
and live together.

406
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,500
We should keep problems on the table.

407
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,780
What can't be solved?

408
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,220
Listen to me.

409
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,460
If you want to play dirty on the sly,

410
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,620
you will be no different from
Li Shangyou.

411
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,980
Tian.

412
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,020
I didn't allow you to speak.

413
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,140
Did Ye Guohua strike the first blow?

414
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,540
Tian, as for this matter...

415
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,180
It is true that Heizi cursed first.

416
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,380
His words were harsh. It's his fault.

417
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,460
Thus, let's say
there is a good reason for it this time.

418
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,740
I won't hold him accountable.

419
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,060
Tell him after you go back

420
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,580
that if this happens again,

421
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,580
it will be another story.

422
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,860
As for Chen Hongjun,

423
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,660
there's nothing
we need to discuss about.

424
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,180
He hurt Heizi too badly.

425
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,740
If there is no explanation,

426
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,180
what should I say to my men?

427
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,700
How do you think we can solve this?

428
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
The old way.

429
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,900
When Heizi gives a banquet,

430
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,820
let's do it as a mere formality

431
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,700
and let Heizi hit him
with the sharp-tipped tube

432
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,460
to save Heizi's face.

433
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,380
Hongjun has been hanging out with me
since we were kids.

434
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,580
I will take the liberty of

435
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,980
seeing myself as his big brother.

436
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,660
I will take responsibility for
what he has done.

437
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,780
Where are your glasses?

438
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,060
My glasses...

439
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,980
You threw it when fleeing.

440
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,660
Have you ever been in Baoding before?

441
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,740
No.

442
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,260
It is the first time I've been here.

443
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,380
Do you like it?

444
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,980
Very much.

445
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,460
Very much?

446
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,060
What is good about it?

447
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,180
Everything is good here.

448
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,020
The weather and the scenery are good.

449
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,540
And so are the people.

450
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,540
Why are you laughing?

451
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Come on, get in.

452
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,460
(The Legend of the Red Lantern)

453
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,780
You will sleep in this room.

454
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,020
All the bedclothes are new.

455
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,900
This is the main room.

456
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
The washstand is over there.

457
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,460
The washbasin is newly bought.

458
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,820
The toothpaste, toothbrush,
towel and soap are all new.

459
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,700
The kitchen is outside.

460
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,660
Do you know how to light the stove?
There is coal.

461
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,060
Yes. I do.

462
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,500
Then boil the water yourself
if you want to drink some.

463
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,300
The water tap is in the yard.

464
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
In the street, there is a factory

465
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,740
making bottle caps.

466
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,180
I have asked their leader

467
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,700
to allow you to visit
their canteen and bathhouse.

468
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,780
Here you are.

469
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,580
This is the bath coupon
and this is the meal coupon.

470
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,020
Ye Fang, you are so thoughtful.

471
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,140
It's too early for you to be happy.

472
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,660
(Plane Geometry, Chinese,
Physics, Algebra)

473
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,420
Well,

474
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,940
what are these?

475
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,420
The materials you'll use
to review high school learning.

476
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,700
Why are you doing this again?

477
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,180
This is a precondition.

478
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
If you want to live here,

479
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,740
you must review your lessons.

480
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,860
If you refuse to do it,

481
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,740
you can just leave with your luggage

482
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,260
and go wherever you like.

483
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,380
All right. All right.

484
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,180
I... I will do what you say.

485
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,980
However, I left in a hurry

486
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,900
this time.

487
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,860
I didn't have time to get new glasses.

488
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,180
I've got a new pair for you.

489
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,500
Put them on to see whether they fit.

490
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,900
They are fit for me.

491
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,580
They fit me so well.

492
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,260
Ye Fang,

493
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,540
how come you know

494
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
how strong my glasses are?

495
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,660
We grew up together.

496
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,900
It is understandable
that others don't know it.

497
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,060
How can I not know it?

498
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,500
Ye Fang,

499
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,180
thank you.

500
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,820
Don't just talk the talk.

501
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,060
Here is the syllabus for review.

502
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,180
This is the problem set.

503
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,780
Finish them on schedule.

504
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,820
You have homework to do every day.

505
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,460
I will check on you every three days.

506
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,700
You come once every three days?

507
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,580
Yes.

508
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,660
I can ask for leave and come
to supervise you at any time.

509
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,140
What's wrong?

510
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,260
Nothing. Nothing.

511
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,460
Anything else?

512
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,860
No.

513
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,420
Then you work hard at your study.

514
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,100
I will be off.

515
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,700
OK.

516
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,740
I will escort you out.

517
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,900
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

518
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,020
Yes, right. It was an accident.

519
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,620
Yes, yes.

520
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,580
They are all Guohua's friends.

521
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,260
They are young and impulsive.

522
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,100
I have lashed out at Guohua this time.

523
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,260
I understand.

524
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,180
I totally understand.

525
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,260
Then that's it.

526
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,100
Why are you still standing here?

527
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,780
Set your heart on proper business.

528
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,700
Luckily, the man's injury
is not serious.

529
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,380
You are free from
criminal responsibility.

530
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,460
You won't be so lucky

531
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,580
when such a thing happens again.

532
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,580
I got it, Dad.

533
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,100
Thank you, Dad.

534
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,500
If there's nothing else,
I'll go back to my room.

535
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,580
Just go.

536
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,900
Stop!

537
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,060
(Advance on the road of film revolution)

538
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,740
Who is it?

539
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,580
Who are you talking about?

540
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,100
Don't pretend in front of me.

541
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,860
When we were at Commander Tong's home
last time,

542
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,180
he took leave in haste.

543
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,820
He said he had something urgent to do.

544
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,460
What was the urgent thing?

545
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,980
There was nothing urgent at all.

546
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,660
He doesn't have feelings for Xiaomei.

547
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,220
He has a crush on another girl.

548
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,020
Is she the cause of this fight?

549
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,340
No, Mom. What are you saying?

550
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,220
I just want to know who she is.
Who is she?

551
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,860
No one special.
She is only an ordinary girl.

552
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,540
Which girl?

553
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,460
What is your relationship?

554
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,540
How close have you two become?

555
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,700
It's just...

556
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,980
Just a girl attractive to me.

557
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,100
There are many kinds of feelings, son.

558
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,980
There is the love
between colleagues and friends.

559
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,220
There is the unspoken love
between girls and boys.

560
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,940
There is the love for the girl
one wants to spend all one's life with.

561
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,980
What kind of love is yours?

562
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,980
I will tell you the truth.

563
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,060
But you mustn't make fun of me.

564
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,700
I think I will only love her in my life.

565
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
Who is she?

566
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,340
Where did you meet her?

567
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,980
On Shichahai Ice Rink.

568
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,300
She is beautiful?

569
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,540
Haven't you questioned me enough
today, Mom?

570
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,820
I am not a criminal.

571
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,340
I am tired. I will go back to my room.

572
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,780
Who is she exactly?

573
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,300
Why are you asking me? How come I know?

574
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,700
Well...

575
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,420
Go ask him if you can.

576
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,900
This troublesome brat!

577
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,540
You are recovering very well.

578
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,340
The gauze will be removed soon.

579
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,180
Miss Tong, I owe you a lot this time.

580
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,220
Thank you for taking care of me.

581
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,300
Don't mention it.

582
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,180
Come on, drink some water.

583
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,540
Give it to me.

584
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,660
Why are you here?

585
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
You don't want me to come?

586
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,300
Go back to your work.

587
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,820
Miss Tong, thank you.

588
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,780
Come on.

589
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,260
Zhao Xiaohui,

590
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,340
why are you acting in a loving way?

591
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,940
Nonsense. Open your mouth.

592
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,500
My nose!

593
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,940
My nose!

594
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,900
Xiaomei.

595
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,620
Just in time.

596
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,180
Help me take this to Heizi.

597
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,500
Why don't you take it to him yourself?

598
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,300
Heizi doesn't want to see me.

599
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,180
Why must I make him unhappy
at such a time?

600
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,060
I have to trouble you.

601
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,220
When you go the rounds next time,

602
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,820
give it to him for me.

603
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,620
This is the third time.

604
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,460
He will think he owes you one.
What is bad about that?

605
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,060
I don't care whether it is good or bad.

606
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,580
I just think that

607
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,180
he was so severely injured

608
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,780
and for this,

609
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,900
I am more or less responsible.

610
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,740
What are you saying?

611
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,820
What does this have to do with you?

612
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
(Ophthalmic Ward)
If you must put it this way,

613
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,180
I am also responsible for it.

614
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,180
I know.

615
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,580
It is not your fault.

616
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,620
You didn't want to start the fight.

617
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,660
It was Ye Guohua...

618
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,340
Xiaomei,

619
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,820
you mustn't say this.

620
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,340
Guohua and Hongjun
only wanted to help me.

621
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,740
In the last analysis, it was my fault.

622
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,620
Xiaomei,

623
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,660
you mustn't be unhappy with Guohua

624
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,100
because of this.

625
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,260
He is a very loyal friend.

626
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,980
I have heard that

627
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,460
doctors are all hardhearted.

628
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Now it seems that

629
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,340
being nurses are the best thing to do.

630
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
You are all kindhearted.

631
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,340
I want to be a doctor.

632
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,500
You will be one of the best doctors.

633
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,500
Come on, sorry to trouble you.

634
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,620
Take this to Heizi for me.

635
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,900
I am leaving.

636
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,740
Wait.

637
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,620
I heard Qi Tian talk about

638
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,740
Chen Hongjun with you last time.

639
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,660
You'll have to be hit
by the tube-shaped weapon.

640
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,580
Do you have any plans to cope with it?

641
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,620
I will just let him hit me.

642
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,020
Don't worry, if I am hurt,

643
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,780
I will come to see you for treatment.

644
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,100
See you.

645
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,620
Dong.

646
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,300
You are here.

647
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,700
Where is Tian? Please tell him

648
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
I am here to pay my debt.

649
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,060
Take a seat.

650
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,980
Tian

651
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,100
won't come today.

652
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,940
He knew you
would take the blame for Chen Hongjun.

653
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,780
He knew clearly that

654
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,260
it's not your fault,

655
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,540
but in front of his men,

656
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,580
he couldn't let go of this

657
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,740
with nobody paying the price.

658
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,460
Therefore, he asked you to come here

659
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,980
and asked me to give witness.

660
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,580
From now on, nobody

661
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,820
should speak of this matter again.

662
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,340
But Dong, this matter...

663
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,180
I am too old to

664
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,460
hear you tell me all those stories.

665
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,500
If you have anything to say,
go to see Tian.

666
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,100
You two can have a talk.

667
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:08,940
Tian,

668
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,140
this meal is on the house.

669
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,780
OK.

670
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,660
Enjoy your meal.

671
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,260
Thank you.

672
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,020
I will ladle noodle soup into your bowl

673
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,420
to warm your stomach.

674
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,140
Don't bother.

675
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,340
(It had been a long time)

676
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,100
(since they ate together
sitting opposite.)

677
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,140
(It had been only a few days.)

678
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,340
(With the appearance of Xiao Chunsheng
and Ye Guohua,)

679
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,740
(the intimacy and closeness)

680
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,380
(they had developed over the years)

681
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,340
(seemed to be fading away.)

682
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,700
Qi Tian.

683
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,460
Won't you go see Xiao Chunsheng?

684
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,540
No, I won't.

685
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,660
Why?

686
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
No reason.

687
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,300
I just think it is boring.

688
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,540
What is boring?

689
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,180
Everything is boring.

690
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,220
The life we are living now is boring.

691
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,580
How long have we known each other?

692
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,220
Three years.

693
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,660
Three years and four months.

694
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,340
To be honest with you,

695
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,820
in the past three years,

696
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,700
the only thing I have been doing

697
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,340
is thinking about you.

698
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,980
You need to say nothing.

699
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,140
I know whatever you are thinking.

700
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,860
It's not necessary for me to ask.

701
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,940
Is that true?

702
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,220
Isn't it?

703
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,060
Maybe.

704
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,500
You see,

705
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,300
your attitude

706
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,020
is making me
more and more confused now.

707
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,340
Such a life is just boring.

708
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,020
Right.

709
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,580
Nobody can resist such a temptation.

710
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,260
After all, all the people
we met in the past

711
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,940
were workers or commoners.

712
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,500
Then suddenly,

713
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,820
two children of high-ranking officials
appeared

714
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,820
and they followed you around
day in, day out

715
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,940
like the buzzing bees following flowers.

716
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,020
Anyone will feel the same.

717
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,060
But I have to tell you

718
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,780
everything has a price in this world.

719
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,580
You have to lower yourself
to ask for favors.

720
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,540
If you really are in their debt,

721
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,650
you won't be able to
hold your head high.

722
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,580
I know you, He Hongling.

723
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,860
You are quite proud.

724
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,060
You won't be able to stand it.

725
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,650
Monday is your birthday.

726
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,060
I prepared a gift for you.

727
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,460
This will be the last time.

728
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,820
What are you looking at?

729
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,300
It's my dad.

730
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,580
The photo was taken when he
graduated from Yenching University.

731
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,980
He looks quite good.

732
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,620
But actually,
he is a total stranger to me.

733
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,660
He committed suicide
when I was eight months old.

734
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,540
Subsequently, my mom also...

735
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,900
I was brought up by my mother's mom.

736
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,100
She passed away when I was ten.

737
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,460
Don't you think...

738
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,620
Don't you think I am a jinx?

739
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,020
Do you have any other kinsmen?

740
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,820
Yes.

741
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,900
My mother's sister lives in Heilongjiang,

742
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,100
but we barely contact each other.

743
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,180
I have many relatives
on my father's side,

744
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,300
but they are all in America
or Taiwan of China.

745
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,660
Only my father stayed.

746
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,340
I don't know why he didn't leave.

747
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,260
Over the years,

748
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,540
you must have suffered a lot,
haven't you?

749
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,020
Me?

750
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,500
What do you think can make me

751
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,860
suffer and give me a hard time?

752
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,380
Let's drink this today.

753
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,700
This bottle of liquor

754
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,260
was a birthday gift for my grandma

755
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,380
from her student.

756
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,580
She is gone.

757
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,060
It will break my heart to drink it.

758
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,060
Let's drink it today.

759
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,900
Tian,

760
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,740
you should keep it.

761
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,660
Keep it as a souvenir.
Don't waste it on me.

762
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
I will open it.

763
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,100
If I keep it longer,

764
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
it will lose most of its taste.

765
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,620
That will be a greater waste.

766
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,580
(Guizhou Moutai Baijiu)

767
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,860
I invited you to come today

768
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,580
to chat with you.

769
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,260
I know.

770
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,100
But why?

771
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,940
I just want to

772
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,700
entrust you with He Hongling,

773
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,540
Heizi,

774
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,420
and all my men

775
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,900
before I leave.

776
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,220
Leave?

777
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,700
Where are you going?

778
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,300
I will go to Tianjin first
and then to Guangzhou.

779
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
My final destination is Shenzhen.

780
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,900
Shenzhen?

781
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,620
It adjoins Hong Kong.

782
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,340
It is a small fishing village
in the south of Guangdong,

783
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,780
I have a pal there.

784
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,180
He is doing quite well.

785
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,820
What will you do there?

786
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,140
Trade things.

787
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,860
Then I will head to Hong Kong.

788
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,460
Tian, are you going to...

789
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,540
Well, why?

790
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,460
You don't think Beijing is good?

791
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,740
It's good.

792
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,740
But I just
don't want to stay here anymore.

793
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,340
No matter how big this city is,

794
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,180
the outside world is bigger.

795
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,660
You also want to join the army, right?

796
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,860
Who doesn't want to go
and see the outside world?

797
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,620
It is boring

798
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,180
to be the boss of a group of men here.

799
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,540
Didn't you ask me
whether I have any other relatives?

800
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,860
If I must say I have,

801
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,980
it is He Hongling.

802
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,180
I know over the years,

803
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,020
she has been believing me
and depending on me.

804
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,420
However, she doesn't fancy me.

805
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,300
I am not so bighearted.

806
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,140
The reason is
that I know she doesn't fancy me.

807
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,860
If she ever fell in love with me,

808
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,780
even if her love is gone now,

809
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,380
I won't let you have her.

810
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,180
Tian.

811
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,980
I just

812
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,980
think you are a nice guy.

813
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,460
I see you as a mate
from the bottom of my heart,

814
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,620
so I said all these to you.

815
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,820
You are not perfect.
You have shortcomings.

816
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,940
Your shortcoming is fatal.

817
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,300
If nobody tells you about it,

818
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,780
you won't achieve
anything big in your life.

819
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,660
Chunsheng, remember this.

820
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,460
You wanted Ye Guohua to have Hongling.

821
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,540
How can you give away love as a gift?

822
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,180
If he is not the one,
he won't win her heart anyway.

823
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,060
Then it will break his heart.

824
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,140
That will make him hate you.

825
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,540
Life hasn't been easy for Hongling.

826
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,460
I admire her heartily.

827
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,260
However, I never pity her.

828
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,540
I am in no position to pity her.

829
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,900
She knows what she wants.

830
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
And she strives for that.

831
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,820
Now Hongling has a crush on you.

832
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,980
You should love her back

833
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,420
and shouldn't let her love
be unrequited.

834
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,260
Tian, when are you leaving?

835
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
I still have something to do.

836
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,980
On the night of the day after tomorrow,

837
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,340
I will go to Badachu
to pick up a batch of goods

838
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,380
to prepare a birthday gift for her.

839
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,060
Come on, a toast to you.

840
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,700
Who is it?

841
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,740
You, stop!

842
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,180
Tian,

843
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,980
why does this man look so familiar?

844
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,980
It's Laosi.

845
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,340
A bloody underling of Li Shangyou.

846
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,700
Li Shangyou's underling?

847
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,060
What is he here for?

848
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,100
What else can it be?

849
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,940
Li Shangyou has long wanted to

850
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
deal with me.

851
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,980
Thus, he was sent to snoop around.

852
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,420
Tian,

853
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,820
Li Shangyou is a bad egg.

854
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,940
Now he has the guts to send men
to your doorsteps.

855
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,220
Just ignore him.

856
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,740
I am leaving in a couple of days.

857
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,620
Why need I be afraid of him?

858
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,780
How can he find me by then?

859
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,140
Let's go.

860
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Let's go back and continue drinking.

861
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,940
A bunch of useless people!

862
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,380
I only told you to spy on Qi Tian,

863
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,100
but you just found out nothing.

864
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,460
I've got news.

865
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,940
Qi Tian

866
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,980
sent all his men away

867
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,420
to talk with Xiao Chunsheng alone.

868
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,020
He said he would run south.

869
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,100
Run? Where will he run to?

870
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,780
Some place called Kong...

871
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,580
Hong Kong?

872
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,220
Perhaps.

873
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Qi Tian is going to Hong Kong?

874
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,700
He is recklessly audacious.

875
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,460
Has he got connections?

876
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,540
It's... it's hard to say.

877
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,940
Qi Tian has a mate surnamed Qu.

878
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,580
He is the one who sends Qi Tian

879
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,380
the spare parts of recorders.

880
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,260
Then Qi Tian will

881
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,380
assemble them

882
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,740
and sell the recorders
as imported goods.

883
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,980
Qian Tian speculates in it?

884
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,660
I don't know.

885
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,060
But I heard this Qu guy

886
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,020
is well-connected

887
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,860
in the south.

888
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,140
I guess Qi Tian wants to

889
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,220
flee to Hong Kong

890
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,220
with his help.

891
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,700
Did you hear Qi Tian say

892
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,140
when he is leaving?

893
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,420
Qi Tian told Xiao Chunsheng

894
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,340
on the night of the day after tomorrow,

895
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,420
he would pick up a batch of goods
from Badachu

896
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,940
and give someone a birthday gift.

897
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
Then he would take off.

898
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,660
Well, Qi Tian,

899
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,420
don't you know the age we are living in?

900
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,860
You still want to flee to Hong Kong.

901
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,460
Hongjun. Hongjun.
