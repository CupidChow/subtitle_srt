=Episode 25=

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,320
But we've been to the rehabilitation center

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
and met so many patients.

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,880
I've finally realized

6
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
that all medical disciplines
serve the people

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,360
and the patients.

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,160
Nothing makes them different.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,720
All jobs are glorious, too.

10
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,480
So,

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm your first patient

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,000
having his rehabilitation, right?

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
So, Dr. Tong,

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
how do you think

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,320
I am doing?

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
80 points, at most.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
80 points?

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,240
I think I deserve 100 points.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
So, Chunsheng,

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,120
you must think it over.

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,520
Xiao Chunsheng,

22
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,000
your letter!

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
In a minute.

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
(Chunsheng, it's been a long time.)

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
(How are you?)

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
(Have you recovered
from your leg injuries?)

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,160
(After I recovered, I was demobbed
and joined the Criminal Police Unit.)

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
(Here,)

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
(the skills I learned in the military)

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
(become useful again.)

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
(My life now is busy and fulfilling.)

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,440
(By the way,)

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,640
(I found a girlfriend recently.)

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
(She works at the supply and
marketing cooperative of the county.)

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,280
(We have double income.)

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
(Sometimes I recall)

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,840
(when we were in the military.)

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
(It seems to be yesterday)

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
(and also a long time ago.)

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
(We bragged with Amao)

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
(and competed with Meng Jinzhu to shoot.)

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
(Though they are dead,)

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
(our life is still going on.)

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,040
(I hope to reunite with you one day.)

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
Today is a weekday.

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
My parents have gone to work.

47
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm alone. Come in.

48
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,640
Xiaomei, I have

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
a birthday gift for you in advance.

51
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't really understand it.

52
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
People recommended it to me

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,840
and said it was good.

54
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,440
Do you like it?

55
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
It's useful.

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Really.

57
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm glad to hear that.

58
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,080
Come with me.

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,800
Come on in.

60
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,120
Hold on.

Our nurse put the coat in my mom's room.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,160
It took me a while to find it.

84
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
The other day when I was shopping,

85
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
I saw this red wooden coat.

86
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
I think it's good.

87
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,200

Thank you all for coming

97
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,800
to get this far

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240

100
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
support, and trust.

Now,

102
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,760
I want to thank you.

103

Thank you, guys.

Things don't always
work out as you think.

105
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,280
In the past, I took the wrong path

106
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
and made some mistakes.

107
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Fortunately, you're there for me.

108
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm kind of

109
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
incoherent, right?

110
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
I'm a bit excited.

111
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,200
Now I have a family

112
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
and a real business.

113
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,920
I feel

114
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
contented

115
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,640
and happy.

119
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,160
- Come on.
- Cheers.

120
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,160
- Fill the glass.
- Cheers.

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,800
- You can't hold your liquor.
- Be careful.

122
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,120
- I...
- It's OK. Go home.

123
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,040
- I'm so happy.
- Yeah, right.

124
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,960
Happy. Happy.

125
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
- Go home.
- So I...

126
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,400
How do you go home?

127
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
We'll take a taxi. Do you need a ride?

128
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
It's OK. You guys go first.

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Are you sure?

130
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah. You go first.

131
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
OK. Goodbye.

132
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,000
See you.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,960
Take care of him.

134
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
He's almost drunk.

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,440
A piece of cake.

136
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
Be careful.

137
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
Shall we take a walk?

138
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,920
I used to come here to read before.

139
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,720
One day,

140
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,920
I found a girl in there

141
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,280
who also loved reading.

142
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
I went over and picked up the book,

143
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,640
Notes on Nursing she was reading.

144
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,080
Ouch.

145
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,880
Later on,

146
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
I wanted to meet the female ghost

147
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,480
who scared me and

148
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
made me drop my dumplings.

149
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,480
But the ghost busters of
the Revolutionary Committee

150
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,640
nearly caught us red-handed.

151
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Fortunately, I was smart.

152
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I had a brainwave
at the crucial moment

153
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
and pushed over a bookshelf,

154
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
thus saving her.

155
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,520
Afterward...

156
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,000
Afterward, I got this bookmark

157
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,040

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
if I had met the girl then,

161
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
what would have happened?

162
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Would I chase her?

163

Would she agree to be my girlfriend?

164
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,520
But what happened can't be changed.

165

♪As vigorously as how we first met♪

174
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,370

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,720
♪Keeps out all the loneliness♪

176
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,840
I'll make it brief.

177
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,440
We have a mission.

178
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,920
The charity performance in Luquan County

179
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,160
needs volunteers.

180
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,400
Who wants to go?

181
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Where is Luquan County?

182
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,520
I've never heard of it.

183
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
Maybe some out-of-way place.

184
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,400
I won't go.

185
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
I don't want to go, either.

186
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
I don't want to go.

187
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Don't pick me.

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,720
Not me. Not me. Not me.

189
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,040
Ma'am, I'll go.

190
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,560
You?

191
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,200
Hello.

192
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,080
Say it.

193
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,720
I see.

194
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,060
(Silence)

195
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
Hongling. Hongling.

196
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Hongling. Hongling.

197
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,200
(Keep quiet)

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,880
Doctor.

199
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,720
How is she?

200
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,320
Her body temperature reached 38.2℃.

201
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,240
We've just given her an IV drip.

202
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,840
Her fever is almost gone.

203
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,840
Let her rest in bed.

204
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Perhaps she's been tired lately

205
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
and her immune system weakens.

206
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Thank you.

207
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,760
OK.

208
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200
Chunsheng.

209
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,680
Chunsheng.

210
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,440
Hongling, I'm Guohua.

211
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
I came to see you.

212
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,880
Hongling.

213
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,680
Guohua, why are you here?

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
Mrs. Huang contacted me

215
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,160
and told me she didn't see you
in the canteen at supper.

216
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,760
So she asked someone to check on you.

217
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
It turned out you had a fever.

218
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,080
You must be exhausted.

219
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,880
Have a good rest.

220
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,960
Comrade Ye,

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
let go of her hand.

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,760
Come with me.

223
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Have a good rest.

224
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,640
She has caught a viral cold,

225
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,400
which seems to

226
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
come and go quickly,

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,000
but,

228
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,040
if the fever lingers,

229
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,590
it may cause myocarditis.

230
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,800
If she gets myocarditis,

231
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,480
with our current medical level,

232
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
her life will be in danger.

233
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,160
So,

234
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
we suggest injecting her with

235
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,960
immunoglobulin as soon as possible.

236
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
It's an antiviral drug
imported from Cuba.

237
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,480
It can eliminate viruses

238
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,600
and neutralize antibodies.

239
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
It has good therapeutic

240
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,120
and preventive effects both on

241
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,400
viral cold and myocarditis.

242
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,960
But the drug is in short supply.

243
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
We've run out of it for a long time.

244
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,160
Could you

245
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,960
use your connections and

246
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,520
ask the other forces for help?

247
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,800
I see.

248
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll see what I can do.

249
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
Comrade, may I use the phone?

250
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,000
Thanks.

251
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,000
Hello.

252
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,160
Do you have

253
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
the antiviral drug imported from Cuba?

254
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,440
Yeah.

255
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Could you check it for me? Thanks.

256
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you have it?

257
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,320
No?

258
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,160
OK. Thanks.

259
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
Hello, I'm Ye Guohua.

260
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
Do you have

261
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,680
the antiviral drug imported from Cuba?

262
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,600
No?

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,360
Could you check it?

264
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,160
Really no?

265
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,560
Thanks.

266
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,320
Hello.

267
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,320
Do you have

268
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,720
the antiviral drug imported from Cuba?

269
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,760
Yes.

270
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,720
Yes, right?

271
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes.

272
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,480
OK. Thanks.

273
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,320
Don't move.

274
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
You're having an IV drip. Don't move.

275
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
Do you feel better?

276
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
To get you the specific drug,

277
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,840
he went to the hospital
of Thirty Mile Village by bike

278
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,680
last night.

279
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
You're so lucky.

280
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,760
Your boyfriend is so good to you.

281
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
You are awake.

282
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
Do you feel better?

283
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,040
Slowly.

284
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,040
Are you hungry?

285
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,440
I'll get you some food from the canteen.

286
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm not hungry.

287
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
You are such a fool.

288
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,400
In the middle of the night,

289
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,680
you went so far by bike.

290
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
There are wolves near
Thirty Mile Village.

291
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,800
The villagers have run into them
several times.

292
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,240
I recited Quotations from
Chairman Mao while riding.

293
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,920
It would scare off
all the reactionaries

294
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,280
let alone wolves and beasts.

295
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,480
I've just caught a cold.

296
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,360
It's no big deal
to take the drug a day or two later.

297
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,360
That won't do.

298
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,040
The doctor said

299
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,440
you'd better take it early.

300
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,560
You'll be in trouble
if it causes myocarditis.

301
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,440
If you get myocarditis
because of one night of delay,

302
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,360
I don't know how regretful I will be.

303
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,800
You're so good to me.

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,560
How can I thank you?

305
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,840
You don't have to.

306
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
Considering our friendship,

307
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,040
aren't I supposed to do this?

308
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Don't thank me.

309
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,320
What's wrong?

310
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,880
Nothing.

311
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,440
It's getting late.

312
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,440
Are you hungry?

313
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,360
Have a cake.

314
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
I'm not hungry.

315
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,880
OK.

316
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't eat, then.

317
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,720
Well,

318
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,120
you must be hungry.

319
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,240
Here, have some water.

320
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm not thirsty.

321
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
What are you doing?

322
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,720
There are mosquitoes.

323
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,720
I'm swatting them for you.

324
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,960
There are no mosquitoes this season.

325
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,720
There are.

326
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,880
Look.

327
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Mosquito.

328
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,880
You don't have to do this for me.

329
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm returning a favor

330
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,840
with a favor.

331
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,560
You took good care of me before.

332
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
I should repay you.

333
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,720
Did I take care of you this way?

334
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah.

335
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,880
Was I so annoying?

336
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
So you think I'm annoying, right?

337
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,400
OK.

338
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,680
I'm leaving.

339
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,040
That's not what I mean.

340
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,280
Then what do you mean?

341
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,240
I think you've almost recovered.

342
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,920
I hope you can do

343
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,680
whatever you want to do.

344
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,760
Xiaomei, you know what,

345
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
I've already thought about it.

346
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
What do I want to do?

347
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
What can I do?

348
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,480
Serving in the army

349
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,000
used to be my only goal in life.

350
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
I never thought about
other possibilities.

351
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
But I can't serve in the army now.

352
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,400
I just don't know

353
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
what to do next.

354
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,440
It doesn't matter.

355
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,760
Take your time to consider it.

356
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
But there is something urgent.

357
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,360
My mom wants to see you.

358
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
She wants to see me?

359
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,400
She has been nagging me.

360
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,680
I think you'd better meet earlier

361
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,640
and leave me in peace.

362
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah, OK.

363
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,240
The ugly son-in-law must see
his mother-in-law sooner or later.

364
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,920
Nonsense. You're not ugly.

365
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,600
Yummy.

366
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
I'll share it with you.

367
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
I don't want it.

368
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
OK. I'll eat it.

369
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,920
I'll eat it.

370
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
OK.

371
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,880
What's wrong?

372
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,960
Help me.

373
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,560
(Chen Hongjun
wanted to prove himself to Ye Fang.)

374
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,200
(Working hard at the Customs,)

375
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,960
(he'd gradually been
recognized by his superiors)

376
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,240
(and become thrived.)

377
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
Class is over.

378
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,480
Xiaomei.

379
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
What's this?

380
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,440
Come.

381
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
You must be sick of
the food in the canteen.

382
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,040
Have a taste of my cuisine.

383
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,440
Xiaomei, you're good.

384
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
You should be busy studying.

385
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,720
How could you make time to cook?

386
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,280
I remember when I was preparing for
the college entrance examination,

387
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
I didn't even have time to sleep.

388
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,840
Try it.

389
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,680
You are good at cooking,

390
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,560
studying,

391
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,000
and treating illness.

392
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,200
How lucky Xiao Chunsheng is
to have such a girlfriend like you!

393
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,280
What's wrong?

394
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,320
Xiao Chunsheng is lucky.

395
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,920
But I don't know if you're lucky.

396
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,560
What harsh words

397
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
are you going to say again?

398
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm your close comrade-in-arms.

399
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,520
Since the beginning,

400
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,120
I've stood on your side.

401
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
But to be honest,

402
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
he doesn't even have a real job.

403
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,480
You should do something about him.

404
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,280
Look at Qi Tian and Heizi.

405
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,640
They trade whatever is popular

406
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,640
and have earned money more or less.

407
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,920
He used to be the best in the group.

408
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,560
Aren't you disappointed in him?

409
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
What should I do?

410
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,120
Control him as you do to Chen Hongjun?

411
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,240
You're so glib-tongued.

412
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
I know him.

413
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,640
He isn't just
idling around all day long.

414
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,600
You should give him time.

415
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
You've never left Beijing.

416
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,800
You don't have to catch up with the era.

417
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,480
But he is different.

418
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,360
In the past,

419
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,960
he cared about nothing
other than the battlefield.

420
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Now his dream
on the battlefield is broken.

421
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
You should give him time

422
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,080
and allow him to find a new dream.

423
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,320
Fine.

424
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,480
He belongs to you.

425
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,120
Do whatever you want.

426
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,280
Let me try.

427
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,360
It smells good.

428
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,920
Yummy.

429
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,920
Yummy.

430
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,460
(State-run Gengxin Restaurant)

431
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,020
(Day and Night Shop)

432
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
Eat while it's warm

433
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,320
or it'll get cold.

434
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
I like the food you cook,
no matter if it's warm or cold.

435
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,680
Leave it there first.

436
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
I saw the bike outside.

437
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,040
Is Heizi here?

438
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,920
He's inside there.

439
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,880
He doesn't do anything serious.

440
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,960
I didn't agree with you to
rent it to him in the first place.

441
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,920
Alright, stop nagging.

442
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,080
I'll go check on him.

443
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,800
Go ahead.

444
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
Eat your food.

445
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,400
Yanqiu, why are you here?

446
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Sit down.

447
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I rented this place to you

448
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
to do business.

449
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,560
You've made it a mess.

450
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,080
If your customers see this,

451
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,280
how dare they do business with you?

452
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,480
You don't understand.

453
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,080
My business

454
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,480
is a long shot as well as a big one.

455
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,600
Now is the slack season and

456
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,320
we have no customers.

457
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,920
When I make a sale,

458
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
I'll make money.

459
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,880
When I make money,

460
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,440
the first thing I do will be moving out.

461
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,200
I'll find a place

462
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,600
and set up a company.

463
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,800
At that time,

464
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
I'll pay you double the rent...

465
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
OK, enough.

466
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,480
That's not what I'm going to say.

467
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,520
Isn't it?

468
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,440
Then what is it? Just tell me.

469
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,640
I'll do whatever you ask.

470
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,640
What's wrong with you and Xiaohui again?

471
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
About having a baby?

472
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
If you want a baby,

473
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,200
communicate with her patiently.
Why did you fight?

474
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
Xiaohui

475
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,240
used to be an athlete,

476
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,400
right?

477
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,520
She was not allowed to have a baby.

478
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,000
But now she is no longer young.

479
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,520
I think she must want a baby, too.

480
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,160
Yanqiu,

481
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,000
she is no longer an athlete now.

482
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,120
She is a model.

483
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,400
You've never heard of it, right?

484
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,880
Let me tell you.

485
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,760
They build a platform.

486
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,920
Then a group of women

487
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,640
wearing

488
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,920
all kinds of loud clothes

489
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,200
stand on the platform.

490
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,040
With hands on their hips,

491
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,000
their bottoms wiggle and wiggle

492
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,880
as they walk on the platform.

493
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,600
At the same time,

494
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,320
they bat their eyes at the crowd.

495
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,120
After reaching the end,

496
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,440
they flip their hair, turn round,

497
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,480
and wiggle back.

498
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Then they change their clothes
backstage and wiggle again.

499
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,560
The crowd there,

500
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,760
men, women, old and young,

501
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,480
all point at them,

502
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,280
watch them, and take their photos.

503
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,360
She said they were
promoting the clothes.

504
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,320
The clothing company would pay them.

505
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,240
What the heck is that?

506
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,000
Are you mad at her because of this?

507
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,360
What else could it be?

508
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,320
Isn't it enough to make me mad?

509
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,920
If there is anything else,

510
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,440
I...

511
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,080
Enough.

512
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,600
Heizi,

513
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,640
only Xiaohui can

514
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,320
put up with your nasty temper.

515
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Put up with me if she can.

516
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,920
If she can't, get out of my house.

517
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,240
What did I say?

518
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,800
You're a couple.

519
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,520
Can't you talk nicely to her?

520
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,360
What's the point of all the tough talk

521
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,360
to your wife?

522
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
What happens at last?

523
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,880
At last, she simply ignores you.

524
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
And she doesn't leave, either.

525
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,240
You are the one who will leave.

526
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,880
Enough.

527
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,800
Do as I say.

528
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Go home.

529
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,520
Don't make groundless accusations.

530
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,160
No matter how true your love is,

531
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
you'll wear it out.

532
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,670
Yanqiu,

533
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,120
how do you know this?

534
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,400
Did she see you?

535
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,840
What do you think?

536
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,150
Alright.

537
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,400
Don't be stubborn.

538
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,520
Go home quickly.

539
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,280
Let me see who this is.

540
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,560
See what?

541
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,480
For so many days,

542
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,200
I've lived here alone.

543
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,800
Now there's suddenly another man.

544
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,920
Shouldn't I check who he is?

545
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,120
What?

546
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,760
Why can't I come back?

547
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,680
This is my house.

548
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,480
Touchy.

549
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,200
Look.

550
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,160
This is my wage today.

551
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,320
I don't make less money than you, do I?

552
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,960
Take it.

553
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,360
Pay the rent.

554
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
You haven't made a sale lately, right?

555
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,080
Dirty.

556
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,520
What did you say?

557
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,160
I said the money was

558
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,360
dirty.

559
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,160
Heizi, don't be ridiculous.

560
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm your wife, not your slave.

561
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
I have the right
to choose my profession.

562
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,880
Also,

563
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,320
why am I dirty to be a model?

564
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm not a thief, robber, or whore.

565
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,680
You've never read the newspaper.

566
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,520
It's in the newspaper.

567
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,160
Fashion show.

568
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,240
Show.

569
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,760
New things in the new era.

570
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,120
That's a real profession.

571
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,640
The profession of beauty is art.

572
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
It's a part of

573
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,520
the socialist spiritual civilization,
understand?

574
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,280
Heizi, if you don't trust me

575
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,120
and think I'm cheating on you

576
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,800
outside every day,

577
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,920
OK, show me the proof.

578
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
If you can show me any proof,

579
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
I won't say a word.

580
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,560
I'll pack up, leave right away,

581
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
and divorce you.

582
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,840
If you don't have any proof,

583
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,200
but are always suspicious,

584
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,280
or adhere to the feudal dross,

585
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,440
then you're bullying me on purpose.

586
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,840
Bully!

587
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,920
You're bullying me!

588
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,920
Do you have the heart?

589
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,600
I just can't stand
other men looking at you.

590
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
It's the models' work

591
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,200
to show themselves to people.

592
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,400
Moreover,

593
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,920
your wife is pretty.

594
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,080
So people would like to see her.

595
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,640
Think about the movie stars.

596
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
They are loved by the whole country

597
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,400
because they are pretty.

598
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
But they also
get married sooner or later.

599
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,640
And they still have to work
after they're married.

600
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Moreover,

601
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,440
didn't you marry me because I was pretty?

602
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,440
Take it.

603
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,120
I've had a long day.

604
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
My waist is sore and my back aches.

605
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,480
Give me a back rub.

606
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,120
In your dreams!

607
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,880
Fine.

608
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,440
If you don't give me a rub today,

609
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,200
someone else will tomorrow.

610
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,400
Think about it.

611
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,440
Who will rub you tomorrow?

612
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
- Be gentle.
- Say again.

613
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,400
Who will rub you?

614
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,720
Honey, does it feel good?

615
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
Good.

616
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,840
Why?

617
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
Are you nervous?

618
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,360
Of course not.

619
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,880
How can I be nervous?

620
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,400
Right?

621
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I've seen your parents.

622
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,680
So you know them.

623
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,800
Well,

624
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,320
apples and oranges.

625
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,440
My place was different before.

626
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,280
Think about it.

627
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,560
In Mr. Tong's mind,

628
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,080
I was just the son
of his old comrade-in-arms,

629
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,640
outstanding,

630
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,760
good-looking,

631
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,720
and decent.

632
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,120
He must be happy for his comrade.

633
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,720
You're good at beautifying yourself.

634
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,840
Then tell me,

635
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,600
why do you think my dad tried to

636
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
bring me and Ye Guohua together

637
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,800
instead of you?

638
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,680
Evidently,

639
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,680
he was afraid that
his daughter didn't deserve me

640
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,200
and that he would let his comrade down.

641
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,400
Totally crap.

642
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Don't you like my crap?

643
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,800
You're better than that.

644
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,120
You're full of crap.

645
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,400
Do you like it?

646
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,160
OK. I'll keep practicing.

647
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,920
In the future, I'll be the king of crap.

648
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,240
Let's go.

649
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Do you think
I've brought enough things?

650
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,120
Shall I buy some fruits?

651
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,600
Just go.

652
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,400
No need?

653
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
Don't laugh.

654
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,200
Dad, Mom.

655
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,360
We are back.

656
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,400
What took you so long?

657
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,080
Dinner is ready.

658
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,960
Chunsheng insisted on
bringing you some gifts.

659
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,200
So we were delayed.

660
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,960
Hello, Mrs. Tong.

661
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,880
Hello.

662
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
Put the things down.

663
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,640
Let's have dinner.

664
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,920
Welcome.

665
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,600
Sir!

666
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,840
We are at home,

667
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,040
not in the military.

668
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,120
Feel free.

669
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,640
Sit down.

670
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,240
Yes!

671
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
How long have you been together?

672
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,040
Report, sir!

673
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,440
Xiaomei and I are just starting to date.

674
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,120
Just start to date?

675
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,720
Is it a sudden impulse

676
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
or the empathy of a patient

677
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,000
to a medical staff?

678
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,040
Sir, it isn't true.

679
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,400
Though Xiaomei and I
are just starting to date,

680
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,200
as friends and comrades-in-arms,

681
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,680
we've known each other for a long time.

682
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,480
We know well about

683
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,720
each other's goals,

684
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,920
attitudes toward life,

685
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,720
and characters.

686
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,280
Didn't Dad ask you

687
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,120
to feel free at home?

688
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,880
Chunsheng, have your legs recovered?

689
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,520
Do you have any sequelae?

690
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,960
Mrs. Tong,

691
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,680
thanks to Xiaomei's encouragement,

692
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,960
I did the rehab well.

693
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,560
My legs have recovered completely.

694
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,400
Rest assured.

695
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,800
So what's your job now?

696
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,000
Will you return to the military?

697
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,280
I've been demobilized.

698
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm almost done with the procedures.

699
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,360
As for my job...

700
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,160
Mom,

701
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,040
Chunsheng plans to start a business.

702
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,160
Business?

703
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,200
Mom,

704
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
times have changed.

705
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,800
We've been in the military
all these years,

706
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,680
knowing little about the world.

707
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,160
There are many opportunities.

708
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,400
Choosing a career

709
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,000
is a lifelong matter

710
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,680
like choosing a partner.

711
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,680
Believe us.

712
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,080
Give us some time.

713
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I believe in Chunsheng.

714
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,440
He has ideals.

715
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,000
Even though he has left the military,

716
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,840
he can still
realize his ideals in other places.

717
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,600
Well, did you hear it?

718
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,400
How could...

719
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,440
Alright, no more talk.

720
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Let's eat.

721
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,080
Eat.

722
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,020
(Research Methodology of Traditional
Chinese Medicine Pharmacology)

723
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,200
Sit down.

724
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,880
My daughter wasn't willing to

725
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,720
play elsewhere other than

726
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,200
in my study when she was little.
