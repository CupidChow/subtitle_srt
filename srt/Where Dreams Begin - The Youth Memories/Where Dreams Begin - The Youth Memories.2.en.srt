00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,340
Mr. Qi.

4
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,660
There they are.

5
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,540
(Natural Science)

6
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
That is Tonia?

7
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,700
Chunsheng,

8
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,140
that man over there

9
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,220
is Qi Tian,

10
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,780
Guo Heizi's boss.

11
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,620
I heard that he broke a hand

12
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,380
of Li Shangyou, the street king
of the southern part of the city

13
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,900
for a girl.

14
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,580
Maybe it's this girl.

15
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,140
Are there picketers around here?

16
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,020
Not bad, you really came.

17
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,700
What?

18
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,580
You thought I would not dare to come?

19
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,380
Let's put the hat matter aside.

20
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,140
I'll ask you something.

21
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,020
There is a sketch
at the entrance of the ice rink.

22
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,860
Did you guys post it?

23
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,020
Yes.

24
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
We did that.

25
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,180
Then let me ask you another question.

26
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,380
Who is Ye Guohua?

27
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,100
What's wrong?

28
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,220
You dared to leave your name
but dare not step out?

29
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,020
I'll ask again.

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Who is Ye Guohua?

31
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,260
I am Ye Guohua.

32
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,140
You are Ye Guohua?

33
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,140
You drew it?

34
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,220
Did you see her?

35
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,700
Listen,

36
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,100
Mr. Qi brought that girl here.

37
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,860
Do you dare to court her? She's there.

38
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,540
Come on.

39
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,460
What's wrong?

40
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,100
You don't dare?

41
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,940
It's him?

42
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
This boy

43
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,100
is interesting.

44
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,860
Mr. Qi, give out your order!

45
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,580
Guohua, what should we do?

46
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,580
Let's go.

47
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,700
You are Qi Tian?

48
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,420
You guys always run amok.

49
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
And today, you are making trouble again?

50
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,740
Come on.

51
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,380
Set the rules.

52
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,060
Watch your mouth!

53
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,060
What's wrong with you?

54
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,620
Put your hand down!

55
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,500
What do you want?

56
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,140
What do you want?

57
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,420
You guys, get out of here!

58
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,340
Go home!

59
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,780
Get out of here!

60
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,020
The picketers are here,

61
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
so we can't do anything now.

62
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,060
I'll see you at the Meridian Gate
three days later.

63
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,540
You can bring
as many people as you want.

64
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,340
Let's go!

65
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,900
This is not over!

66
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,740
You are doomed.

67
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,620
Get out of here!

68
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,540
Leave now!

69
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,460
Chunsheng.

70
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,260
What did he say?

71
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,940
We'll meet again
at the Meridian Gate three days later.

72
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,020
Let's go.

73
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,340
OK.

74
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,820
(Shichahai Ice Rink)

75
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,860
Hongling,

76
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,780
what was that boy called again?

77
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,060
Ye Guohua, right?

78
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,140
You two cooperated pretty well just now.

79
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,220
You were almost in his arms.

80
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,140
These compound boys are really arrogant.

81
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,500
But I'll make them regret it

82
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,580
in three days.

83
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,220
I'll bring so many people
to kick their bottoms!

84
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,780
He is not Ye Guohua.

85
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,580
He's not?

86
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,540
Who is he then?

87
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,340
Do you want to know?

88
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,780
Of course.

89
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,030
Two sevens.

90
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,500
Two tens.

91
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,980
Not bad.

92
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,540
Boss.

93
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,820
Today,

94
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,700
I saw Qi Tian and his boys
at the ice rink.

95
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,300
They almost had a group fight

96
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,860
with some compound boys.

97
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
What are you looking at?

98
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,860
Boss.

99
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,940
Don't worry.

100
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,500
Sooner or later, we will get a chance
to destroy Qi Tian.

101
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,460
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

102
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,500
(Work hard to build a strong navy)

103
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,700
Chunsheng.

104
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,820
The food is on the table.

105
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,940
I'm leaving for the factory.

106
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,980
(Grenade-throwing)

107
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,580
(Study hard to improve shooting skills
Practice hard to defend our motherland)

108
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,820
(A person armed with Mao Zedong Thought
has the greatest combat power)

109
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,140
I'll ask again.

110
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,700
Who is Ye Guohua?

111
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,340
I am Ye Guohua.

112
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,500
Guohua.

113
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,260
I am leaving.

114
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,220
Guohua.

115
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,900
Don't fight.

116
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,220
Look at what time it is!

117
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,300
And he's still sleeping!

118
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,580
He's not even seeing you off.

119
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,580
Guohua!

120
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,900
Guohua!

121
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,220
Mom, come on.

122
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,260
Just let him sleep.

123
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,460
He'll sleep forever.

124
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,420
Every day he's like this.

125
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,700
Take this with you.

126
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,820
Button up.

127
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,140
It's cold outside.

128
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,060
OK.

129
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,460
Get along well with Chen Tao.

130
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,860
Don't lose your temper a lot.

131
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,260
Mom, I'm leaving.

132
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,180
Put your gloves on.

133
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,140
OK.

134
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,540
Bye, Mom.

135
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,740
So it turns out that

136
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,700
the girl in a red scarf yesterday
was He Hongling.

137
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,660
No wonder Qi Tian offended

138
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,380
Li Shangyou for her.

139
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,260
I heard Qi Tian was ruthless.

140
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,340
He disabled

141
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,460
Li Shangyou's hand

142
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,220
with a knife.

143
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,660
And the other girl

144
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,500
was Zhao Xiaohui.

145
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,060
She is also famous on Gulou Street.

146
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,340
You know her?

147
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,500
Go on.

148
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,780
I practiced long-distance running
for half a year in the sports school.

149
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,300
She was on the synchronized
swimming team.

150
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
And everybody knew her!

151
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,980
There were people fighting
at the school gate every day.

152
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,740
Sometimes they even used knives.

153
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,660
More than half of the fights
had to do with her.

154
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,700
She liked to see

155
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,980
boys fighting for her.

156
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,060
Later, I heard that she became
a dandy's girlfriend.

157
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
I think that dandy is Heizi.

158
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,020
If you ask me,

159
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,060
Zhao Xiaohui

160
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,500
is not a decent girl.

161
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,580
In the ice rink yesterday,

162
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,620
she was surrounded by men.

163
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,740
That's enough.

164
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,580
Let's talk business.

165
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,460
Chunsheng,

166
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,820
my advice is

167
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,660
we can't be there
the day after tomorrow.

168
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,260
Chunsheng,

169
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,060
a wise man knows when to give up.

170
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,580
We can't go head-to-head with them.

171
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,700
That doesn't make us cowards.

172
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,900
Chunsheng,

173
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,140
it's me who caused the trouble.

174
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,860
I can't let you take all the pressure,

175
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,220
and I also can't implicate everyone.

176
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,540
If someone has to bow his head,
it should be me.

177
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,500
They'll mock me at most.

178
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,620
It doesn't matter.

179
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,820
Hongjun,

180
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,820
say something.

181
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,900
I'll do what Chunsheng says.

182
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,980
If he wants me to bow my head,
I'll do it.

183
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,140
If he wants us to keep our heads high,

184
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,780
then I'll risk my life.

185
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,860
Don't add fuel to the fire.

186
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,660
Chunsheng,

187
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,140
just tell us what to do.

188
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,700
We'll follow your lead.

189
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,820
I'll get the door.

190
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,500
Who is it?

191
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,940
Hello, is Xiao Chunsheng here?

192
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,700
Yes.

193
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Guohua, who is it?

194
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,340
I need to talk to you.

195
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,500
What's up?

196
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,540
Let's talk alone.

197
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,580
The back room.

198
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,900
You drew that sketch?

199
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,060
Don't go to the Meridian Gate

200
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,940
the day after tomorrow.

201
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,260
Qi Tian will not be there.

202
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,220
And from now on,

203
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,660
he won't bother you anymore.

204
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,620
I promise.

205
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,180
You promise?

206
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,420
Yes.

207
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I made some trouble

208
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,980
and let a girl protect me?

209
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,940
That'll make me
the biggest laughing stock.

210
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,420
I'm doing it for your sake.

211
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,380
You can just forget about this matter.

212
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,500
So you want me to bow my head?

213
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,780
You are not doing it for yourself.

214
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,660
So you mean

215
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
this matter is over?

216
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,820
Yes.

217
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,820
How could this be over like this?

218
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,340
My buddy liked you at first sight.

219
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,820
Who likes me?

220
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,140
Who likes me?

221
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,740
It's you, Xiao Chunsheng, or Ye Guohua?

222
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,020
Guohua of course.

223
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,020
Look at me and say it again.

224
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,660
I said my buddy Ye Guohua likes you.

225
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,260
Wait.

226
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,660
Tell Qi Tian

227
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,340
I'll be there the day after tomorrow.

228
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,340
He can bring

229
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,500
as many people as he wants.

230
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,380
Chunsheng, what happened?

231
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Nothing.

232
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
She came to mediate a settlement,

233
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
and I refused it.

234
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,660
If it were just about me,

235
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
I would bow my head immediately.

236
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,780
I just don't want others

237
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,020
to say anything bad about my brothers.

238
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,540
Moreover,

239
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,140
we are not doing this
for you and Hongjun.

240
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,780
Heizi and the others
have caused so many troubles,

241
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,220
some people have to stop them.

242
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,700
Just tell us your plan,

243
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,050
we'll fight with them if it's necessary.

244
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,700
Yes, Chunsheng, let's fight with them.

245
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,460
I'll be there.

246
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,900
Wait for my notice.

247
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,620
(12:00 at midnight)

248
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,180
Can you not go to the Meridian Gate?

249
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,740
You really like him?

250
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
I fought so many fights for you,

251
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,700
but you never stopped me.

252
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,180
Qi Tian,

253
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,620
I don't owe you anything.

254
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,060
I said from the beginning
that I don't like you.

255
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,860
I hang out with you

256
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,100
just to keep out of trouble.

257
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,180
I know that

258
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,340
you don't like me.

259
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,620
And you know what kind of person I am.

260
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,620
I always know what I'm doing.

261
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,700
I will never do

262
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,580
something I should not do.

263
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,860
Do the new ice skates fit?

264
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,660
They are fine.

265
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,300
New shoes

266
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,940
never perfectly fit.

267
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,420
They are fine.

268
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,940
I heard from Xiaohui that

269
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,380
your portrait at Shichahai
was taken away by somebody.

270
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,620
What's the matter?

271
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,940
Your arms are itchy
in the middle of the night?

272
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,220
I am not a doctor.

273
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
Get out of my way.

274
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,140
Chunsheng,

275
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,660
don't misunderstand us.

276
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
We are here to invite you.

277
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,420
To what?

278
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,700
It's not us who wants to see you.

279
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,220
It's Li Shangyou,

280
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,220
Mr. Li,

281
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,780
who wants to see you.

282
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,380
Li Shangyou?

283
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,300
We don't bear grudges against each other.

284
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,500
No.

285
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,700
Absolutely not.

286
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,060
He just wants to talk to you.

287
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,620
Mr. Li said that

288
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,340
you are a rising star.

289
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,460
He has long admired you.

290
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,580
He has long admired me?

291
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,340
Tell him to come to me by himself then.

292
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,380
I am busy.

293
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,180
You should not be like this.

294
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,340
Mr. Li is at least a senior, isn't he?

295
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,260
I've got no time.

296
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,500
Xiao Chunsheng,

297
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,340
you can't reject him like this.

298
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,220
I don't know him at all.

299
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,540
Then don't blame us

300
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,540
for being rude.

301
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,740
You have to go with us

302
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,820
no matter if you want to go or not.

303
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,340
Boss.

304
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,780
He's here.

305
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,860
Laosi,

306
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,180
leave us alone.

307
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay.

308
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
It's cold, huh?

309
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,740
Come here to warm up.

310
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,940
Mixed leftover?

311
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Smells great.

312
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,780
You wanna have some?

313
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,820
No, thank you.

314
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,300
That woman

315
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
is a jinx.

316
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,180
Who are you talking about?

317
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,500
He Hongling of course.

318
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't say that.

319
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,420
I don't like that.

320
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,820
See?

321
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,220
This hand of mine

322
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,340
was broken by Qi Tian.

323
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,500
It's usually fine,

324
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,740
but you don't know
when it will start shaking.

325
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,500
And I can't control it.

326
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,180
Look.

327
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,180
You called me here today

328
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,060
just to talk about this?

329
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,220
Of course not.

330
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,980
Say it then.

331
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,900
My revenge

332
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,540
has to be taken.

333
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,180
This is your business.

334
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,260
I don't care.

335
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,180
It's our business.

336
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,740
What do you mean?

337
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,420
You are gonna fight him
at the Meridian Gate, right?

338
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
You are quite well-informed.

339
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,980
You have no chance.

340
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,460
You'll lose for sure.

341
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,780
You boys from the compound

342
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,660
are usually arrogant,

343
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,620
but none of you has been in a real fight.

344
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,980
Qi Tian is usually very careful.

345
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,820
He never comes out alone.

346
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,300
I've been watching him
for more than half a year,

347
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,820
but I got no chance.

348
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,820
You want me to challenge him to a duel?

349
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,820
You are smart.

350
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,940
And then?

351
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,340
Then we will work together

352
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,060
to take down Qi Tian.

353
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,500
No.

354
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,540
Why not?

355
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,100
It's immoral.

356
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,140
Listen.

357
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,220
My business is my business,

358
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,180
your hatred is your hatred.

359
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,380
They are different.

360
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,260
See you.

361
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,540
Wait.

362
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,940
You should think about it.

363
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,860
If you agree to do it,

364
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,900
your enemy will be gone

365
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,740
and you'll have a new friend.

366
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,220
But if you don't agree,

367
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,820
after stepping out of this door,

368
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,580
you will have another enemy.

369
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,700
If both the southern and northern
parts of the city see you as an enemy,

370
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,660
your situation will be really hard.

371
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,220
What?

372
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,860
You are threatening me?

373
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,500
I never threaten people.

374
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,380
I don't mean to offend you.

375
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,100
I dare not.

376
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,500
But if you insist on
making it difficult for me,

377
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,900
I have no other choice.

378
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,260
As for making friends,

379
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,700
I'll never make friends

380
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,620
with people like you.

381
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,500
Goodbye.

382
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,100
You are inviting trouble.

383
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,660
What happened, Boss?

384
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,300
He refused?

385
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,100
I'll teach him a lesson!

386
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
No, no, no,

387
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,980
cut it out.

388
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,260
Do you really think

389
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,540
they will be allowed

390
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,100
to have a group fight

391
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,260
in the capital?

392
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,140
I heard that there's a picketer

393
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,860
surnamed Song, right?

394
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,580
Leave him a message.

395
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,980
Got it, I'll do it tomorrow.

396
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,780
(Revolutionary Committee)

397
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,300
(There will be a group fight)

398
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,100
Here comes your dish!

399
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,020
Be careful.

400
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,940
It's hot.

401
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,460
I cooked this dish, have a try.

402
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,380
Actually, I have had dinner.

403
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,500
I'm just here to have a drink.

404
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,900
No problem!

405
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,220
Come on.

406
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,220
I haven't seen you for just half a year,

407
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,380
and now you are a cook?

408
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,780
I have to settle down, right?

409
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,500
I can't fool around all the time.

410
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,540
What happens when the Shrimp

411
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,380
enters the kitchen?

412
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,140
Aren't you afraid
that someone will cook you?

413
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,580
Nobody knows the Shrimp here.

414
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,580
Nobody knows the Shrimp,
the old street king

415
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,700
of Hepingli now?

416
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Come on.

417
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,980
Don't mention that.

418
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,300
You know Liang Dong, right?

419
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,780
He was famous in the whole Beijing,

420
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,700
but now he has become a boxing coach

421
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
and nobody knows him.

422
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,860
So you're gonna settle down
in this small restaurant?

423
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,660
Although this restaurant is unremarkable,

424
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,100
it's an enterprise owned
by the whole people,

425
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,900
and it's directly under
the Municipal Tourism Bureau.

426
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,380
My second uncle works
at the Tourism Bureau.

427
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,260
This cost him a lot of effort.

428
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,820
You have a bad temper,

429
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
is it allowed to beat
or scold customers in this restaurant?

430
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,660
I have no temper at all now.

431
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,860
To be honest,

432
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,500
I'm still in probation period.

433
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,500
I don't even dare to step on ants
when walking.

434
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,460
If I make any trouble

435
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,420
and lose my job,

436
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,140
my mother will hang herself.

437
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,420
Alright.

438
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,660
It's busy in the kitchen.

439
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,980
Enjoy it yourself.

440
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,100
Chunsheng,

441
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,980
you are here for something, right?

442
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,900
No, not at all.

443
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,380
I just haven't seen you for a long time,

444
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,340
and wanted to have a drink with you.

445
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,820
Xia Ming,

446
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,420
come on.

447
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,180
Coming.

448
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,700
Chunsheng,

449
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,020
I know

450
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,420
what happened.

451
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,420
Everybody is talking about it.

452
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,180
What do you mean?

453
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm fine.

454
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,500
Don't listen to their nonsense.

455
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,900
It's not that I don't want to help you.

456
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,340
From now on,

457
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,500
I really can't help you.

458
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,820
I'm not who I was anymore.

459
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,700
My brothers back then

460
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,380
were either imprisoned

461
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,220
or injured.

462
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,220
It's different now.

463
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,660
What are you doing, Xia Ming?

464
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,140
Our master has been calling you.

465
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,420
Let him wait!

466
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,820
Chunsheng,

467
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,260
listen to me,

468
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,100
just bow your head.

469
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,460
It's not shameful.

470
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,460
You have to bow your head
sooner or later anyway.

471
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,540
Anyway?

472
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,700
To whom?

473
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,420
To life.

474
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,340
(Long live Marxism-Leninism)

475
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,380
Have you tried to find some helpers?

476
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,660
I did.

477
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,700
But when they heard that
the other party is Qi Tian,

478
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,620
they all said no.

479
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,100
Alright.

480
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,060
They all said that
Qi Tian was too ruthless.

481
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,900
Other people might make some concession

482
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,900
in the face of us compound boys,

483
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,460
only Qi Tian dares to do anything.

484
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,220
I think we should give up.

485
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,700
She is Qi Tian's girlfriend,

486
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,340
and keeps seducing people.

487
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
What are you talking about?

488
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,380
I'm just...

489
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,220
- How can you say that?
- Guohua,

490
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
he didn't mean that.

491
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,020
I didn't mean that.

492
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
- Why are you getting angry?
- Alright.

493
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,580
I know that

494
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,140
this happened because of me.

495
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,460
I know I brought you trouble.

496
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,500
You were trying to figure out the plan

497
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,660
and find some people to help me.

498
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,500
Remember what I'm gonna say.

499
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,820
What are you gonna say?

500
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,540
- Chunsheng.
- Chunsheng.

501
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
I'll go to Qi Tian

502
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,500
and let him set the rules.

503
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
I'll accept it no matter what happens.

504
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,820
As for He Hongling,

505
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,620
let's not see her anymore.

506
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,820
This matter

507
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,260
is not as bad as you think.

508
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,140
I know what I'm doing.

509
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,780
If others don't want to come,

510
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,660
let's not force them.

511
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,940
It's okay, Chunsheng,

512
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,500
just tell me the time

513
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,820
and I'll inform our brothers.

514
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,380
They are gonna have
a group fight at night?

515
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,700
We'll act as soon as they start to fight.

516
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,300
Let's catch them on the spot.

517
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,540
Mr. Qi,

518
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,660
it's so late but nobody showed up yet.

519
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,700
Could it be that they stood us up?

520
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,940
Do you think Xiao Chunsheng is afraid?

521
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,180
I don't think so.

522
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,660
He has always been arrogant.

523
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,020
Mr. Qi.

524
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,500
There they are.

525
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,020
He came alone?

526
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,980
That's manful.

527
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,380
Why is he alone?

528
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,020
Where are your people?

529
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,620
I'm alone.

530
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,420
Mr. Qi,

531
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,260
as for group fight, I admit defeat.

532
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,340
What's going on?

533
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,460
Nobody

534
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,180
dared to come

535
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,340
after hearing Mr. Qi's name?

536
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,260
Then tell me

537
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,700
how we should end this matter.

538
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,740
We can't just go home like this
just because

539
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,900
you admitted defeat, right?

540
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,700
I admit defeat for group fight.

541
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,940
But as myself,

542
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,220
I don't.

543
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,780
What do you mean?

544
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm here alone today

545
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,660
just to tell you that

546
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,300
I want to challenge you to a duel,
Mr. Qi.

547
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,940
Boxing or wrestling,

548
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,020
you decide.

549
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,740
I will accept it anyway.

550
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,700
But if I win,

551
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,100
you people have to behave.

552
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,020
From now on,

553
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,660
you must stop causing trouble everywhere.

554
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,460
Just tell me

555
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,700
after you decide.

556
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,460
What are you thinking?

557
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,340
Let me see

558
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,140
who dares to touch my brother today!

559
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,420
What does this mean?

560
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,220
Mr. Qi,

561
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,060
give me some time to ask them.

562
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,660
I didn't tell them to come.

563
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,580
Chunsheng,

564
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,900
I know you want to solve this alone,

565
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,980
but we won't allow you to do it.

566
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,220
Yes, Chunsheng.

567
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,180
You gave us the wrong time

568
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,660
just because you wanted
to solve this alone,

569
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,220
right?

570
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,020
Li Shangyou told us that.

571
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,580
Li Shangyou?

572
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,340
Yes.

573
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:34,940
Boss,

574
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,820
good for you.

575
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,900
You knew that he gave his friend

576
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,020
a wrong time?

577
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,220
This show will be great.

578
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,540
Mr. Qi,

579
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,900
you heard it.

580
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,700
I really didn't tell them to come.

581
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,900
It's Li Shangyou who did it.

582
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,620
You know clearly

583
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,140
what he thinks.

584
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,020
Xiao Chunsheng,

585
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,900
you are pretty good at pretending.

586
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,300
What does this have to do
with Li Shangyou?

587
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,540
If you want to find a scapegoat,

588
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,380
you should find a more convincing one.

589
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,500
You mean I'm lying?

590
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,620
What do you think?

591
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,580
What are you talking about?

592
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,780
You heard me!

593
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,300
You compound boys are liars!

594
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,340
We are liars?

595
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
We agreed on this group fight,

596
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,300
didn't we?

597
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,130
Let's do it, brothers!

598
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:15,780
Come on!

599
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,610
Come on!

600
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,260
Get ready.

601
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,690
Stop it!

602
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,820
Stop!

603
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,540
Mr. Qi,

604
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,980
I know you don't believe me.

605
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,020
If I were you,

606
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,980
I would not believe it either.

607
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,580
But it's between the two of us,

608
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,650
we can solve it by ourselves.

609
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,610
Now that our friends are all here,

610
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,340
they can bear witness to our duel.

611
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,500
Alright?

612
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,020
Mr. Qi, don't listen to him.

613
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,580
Let's do it!

614
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,300
You hear him!

615
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,140
No one is allowed to help me.

616
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,660
Then let's play by the old rules.

617
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,620
Head,

618
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,140
face,

619
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,260
neck,

620
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,500
chest,

621
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,420
abdomen,

622
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,180
side waist,

623
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,380
these vital parts must never be touched.

624
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,260
If someone dies,

625
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,340
the other party will shoulder

626
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,620
the responsibility.

627
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,540
The medical fee is on ourselves.

628
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,780
If you can't bear it

629
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,860
and chicken out,

630
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,420
just call stop,

631
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,380
and the other party must stop.

632
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,460
Let's go.

633
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,700
Let's wait a minute.

634
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,180
Liang Dong?

635
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
It's really Liang Dong.

636
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,140
Why is he here?

637
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,340
How did he get the news?

638
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,740
Who is Chen Hongjun?

639
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,180
Me.

640
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,620
I am.

641
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,140
I've worn this cashmere hat for years.

642
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Although it's a bit old,

643
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,460
it always keeps me warm.

644
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,700
Good stuff.

645
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,740
I heard that

646
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,740
my friend took your hat.

647
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,140
I'll pay you.

648
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,700
OK?

649
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,100
Mr. Liang, what are you doing?

650
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,860
Shut up.

651
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,020
Qi Tian

652
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,060
used to be my little brother.

653
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,940
His man beat you and took your hat,

654
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,340
it was their fault.

655
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,660
But he is

656
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,940
pretty famous in the city.

657
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,380
He has his self-esteem.

658
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,020
If you want him to bow his head
in front of you,

659
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,460
I'm afraid he can't do that.

660
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,340
We native Beijingers
are all about dignity.

661
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,340
Now I'm asking you to forgive him

662
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
for my sake.

663
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,460
My little brother
did something wrong first,

664
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,540
so as his senior,

665
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,340
I have to solve this matter for him.

666
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,020
Let's just forget this matter,

667
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:41,940
OK?

668
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,860
Whatever you say, bro.

669
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,020
I came to where I am today

670
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,260
all because of you.

671
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,100
I'll do whatever you say.

672
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,140
What?

673
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,820
You don't accept this?

674
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,780
Looks like you are not
doing me this favor.

675
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,700
Mr. Liang,

676
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,780
thank you for what you are doing.

677
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,180
But you are our senior,

678
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,540
we don't deserve your apology.

679
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,740
It's OK.

680
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,380
I should have come out and stopped you.

681
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,220
But you and Qi Tian

682
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,540
are both big figures

683
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,060
in this city.

684
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,660
Now that you have started this,

685
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,180
if any of you calls a stop,

686
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,660
that means you admit defeat.

687
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,260
How about this?

688
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,860
Let's just end this matter like this.

689
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,660
Qi Tian and his brothers

690
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,460
won't say no

691
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,180
since I'm here.

692
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,020
Okay?

693
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,820
Mr. Liang,

694
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,580
now that you've come forward
to make peace,

695
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,740
we, the compound boys,

696
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,860
have to accept it.

697
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,540
You are fair,

698
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,580
reasonable

699
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,300
and righteous.

700
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,940
You deserve to be our senior.

701
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,580
I, Xiao Chunsheng, admire you.

702
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,940
This matter between me and Mr. Qi

703
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,460
is over

704
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,820
for me.

705
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,500
Am I right, guys?

706
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,660
It's over!

707
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Now is the time.

708
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,420
Let's go!

709
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,180
Go!

710
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,100
Liang Dong,

711
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
if you didn't show up,

712
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,700
there would be another
bloody case in Beijing.

713
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,340
Captain Gao,

714
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,780
I didn't expect you to come.

715
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,980
Even you showed up,

716
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,700
how can I stay out of this?

717
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,220
Captain Gao,

718
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,980
do you have to

719
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,540
bring so many people?

720
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,700
What is this for?

721
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Shut your mouth!

722
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Let me ask you.

723
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,860
What are you doing here
at the Meridian Gate?

724
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,020
Officer,

725
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,540
there's a patriotism education

726
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,820
going on recently.

727
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,620
So we are here

728
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,060
to wait to see the flag raising.

729
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,500
The flag raising?

730
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,260
You are good at making things up.

731
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,740
That's true!

732
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,500
Am I right, guys?

733
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,460
Yes!

734
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,260
What about you?

735
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,980
Also here for the flag raising?

736
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,060
Yes.

737
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,980
We agreed to watch
the flag raising together.

738
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,260
Right?

739
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,180
Yes!

740
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,140
Shut up!

741
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,620
Should I praise you then?

742
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,260
Search them!

743
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,420
See if they are carrying any weapon.

744
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,980
Yes!

745
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,700
Search carefully!

746
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,940
- No.
- No.

747
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,300
Good for you.

748
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
That's it then.

749
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,380
You,

750
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,900
and you,

751
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,060
follow me back to the police station

752
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,900
to make a statement.

753
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,980
The others, go home.

754
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Don't ask for trouble!

755
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,900
Leave now!

756
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,460
Mr. Qi,

757
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,180
after you.

758
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,900
Come on.

759
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,860
Let them all go home!

760
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,780
Leave, all of you!

761
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,180
Everybody, get out of here!

762
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,300
Leave now.

763
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,580
- Let's go.
- Come on.

764
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,300
Let's go home.

765
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,820
Come on.

766
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,700
Let's go.

767
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,500
Come on, go home.

768
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,300
Leave now.

769
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,300
Get out of here.

770
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,340
Go, go, go.

771
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,260
Fortunately, you were just asked
to make a statement.

772
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,580
Nothing serious happened.

773
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,580
That calls for a celebration.

774
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,540
Come on.

775
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:19,940
I almost forgot

776
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,060
about the soup.

777
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,220
Today at this grocery store,

778
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,620
I bought twenty cents' worth
of minced meat.

779
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,660
I made a cabbage meatball
vermicelli soup

780
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,340
for you with it.

781
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,260
I think it's done.

782
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,260
Mr. Liang,

783
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,140
these are enough already.

784
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,380
No more dishes.

785
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,340
It's just a soup.

786
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,300
Mr. Liang,

787
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,500
forget it, it's just twenty cents' worth.

788
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,460
What are you saying?

789
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,020
You should be glad that there's meat.

790
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,500
Go get some hot water

791
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
and heat up the liquor.

792
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,260
It's a cold day, cold liquor
will hurt your stomach.

793
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,660
Luckily, you sent me
the message in advance

794
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,620
to stop me from taking weapons,

795
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,100
or we'd all be in jail now.

796
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,580
I just didn't want to make things worse.
