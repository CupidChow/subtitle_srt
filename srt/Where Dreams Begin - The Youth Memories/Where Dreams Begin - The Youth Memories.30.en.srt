=Episode 30=

3
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,760
Oh, laundry time.

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,120
You love the braised pork shoulder
with soy sauce of Tianfuhao.

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,800
When I passed by Bianyifang Restaurant,

6
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
I bought some roast duck bone.

7
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll cook some rice later.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,160
Let's have a drink.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Is there anything to celebrate?

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,600
Can't we just have a drink together?

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,030
By the way,

12
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,880
can't you find a way

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,480
to help Chunsheng?

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
How do I put it?

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Unlikely.

16
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Now,

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,080
the leadership isn't pleased with him.

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,840
Even if he didn't quit,

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
he would have a hard time in the future.

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,640
What about this,

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
let's find him another job,

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
a job suitable for him.

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,520
Do you remember

24
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
I didn't agree with him to join
the Anti-smuggling Squad?

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Exactly.

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
I must say,

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,240
honey, I really admire you.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,840
You're insightful.

29
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I am

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
a passionate creature

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,920
who is loyal to friends.

32
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,080
But after these days,

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,720
I find that

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
times have really changed.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
We're all grown men.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
We should act our age

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
in considering things.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,480
Most of all, I'm

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
more or less a leader now.

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,720
I should criticize myself.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
In terms of Chunsheng,

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,160
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,000
He has a strong personality

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,160
and isn't good at handling
complex interpersonal relationships.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,480
I even think that he is too immature.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't mind that he affected me.

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
The bottom line is...

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,320
Since when have you started to
hate him?

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,000
When did you decide to drive him away?

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,000
No, I...

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
How could I hate Chunsheng?

52
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
What do you mean by driving him away?

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
You don't understand

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
why I didn't want you

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,520
to work together in the first place.

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,880
Why?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
I was afraid that you would fall out.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm telling you,

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
we're still good friends.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
What you're doing now

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
is worse than what I was worried about.

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
What am I doing?

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
If you can't bear him,

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
you can always ask him to leave.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
But sure, you dare not.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,280
That would be tantamount to
admitting that you're narrow-minded.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,160
You're loyal to your friend and
you can't say it.

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,840
So, you played dirty.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
What did I play?

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,540
(Li Shangyou, General Manager)

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
A noble man makes friends
with who he chooses.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,200
A base man chooses among
the friends he makes.

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,400
Since you insisted on

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
having him work with you
at the beginning,

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
you must accept the consequence.

77
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,400
He hasn't changed, but you have.

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
First a noble man, then a base man.

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,640
You made mistakes again and again.

80
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,340
(Li Shangyou, General Manager)

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm a base man?

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
I helped him

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
when he was frustrated.

85
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
I let him join the Anti-smuggling Squad.

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
I did it for his own good then, and now!

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,920
For his good?

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
You colluded with an outsider
to falsely accuse your friend

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
and you think it's for his own good?

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
He offended people.

91
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
What could I do?

92
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
He is straightforward

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
and he always makes trouble.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Since he joined the squad,

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
I've had to wipe his bottom every day.

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Now you blame me for his leaving?

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Do you know what price I paid for him?

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
You still have a chance
to make it right.

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
Go to see your good buddy and

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
tell him the dirty tricks you played.

101
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
I have nothing to say.

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,360
Chunsheng.

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,640
Fang, sit down.

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Did I keep you waiting?

105
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
No, I just arrived.

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
About your work...

107
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
That's what you asked to see me for?

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,360
OK, I should sincerely

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,960
apologize to you.

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
You should scold me.

111
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Why would I?

112
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,920
I should have listened to you

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
and not worked with the squad.

114
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,520
If I had listened to you,

115
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,800
I wouldn't have implicated Hongjun.

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,360
What do you mean?

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,320
Fang,

118
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,800
don't blame Hongjun.

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
He told me about your opinions.

120
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,000
We don't hide anything from each other.

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,160
He didn't blame you.

122
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
He just couldn't understand.

123
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,800
I didn't understand at first, either.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,360
I thought

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
you seemed to

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
have a problem with me.

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,280
But now I understand.

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,400
You see more and further than us.

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,040
Really.

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
People may not know themselves well.

131
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
They need to be reminded.

132
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,960
Of course,

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
not everyone can do this.

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,320
Only smart ones can,

135
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,040
exceptionally smart ones.

136
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,120
I've only met

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
two exceptionally smart people.

138
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,840
You are one of them.

139
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
Who is the other?

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
My comrade-in-arms,

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
who died on the battlefield.

142
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Speaking of that,

143
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
I miss them.

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
I should make time to visit them.

145
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
By the way, do you have
anything else to say?

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,200
Nothing else.

147
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm worried that you would

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
feel depressed after losing your job.

149
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,760
I want to straighten you out.

150
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,520
Are you making fun of me?

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,240
No.

152
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,040
Alright.

153
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
For the sake of your friendship,

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,760
I should pull myself together.

155
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
How is Hongjun doing?

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,560
He...

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,360
is fine.

158
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,320
Fang,

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
you should give him some guidance.

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
He listens to you.

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,400
Tell him

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,360
to explain himself to his leader

163
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
and pull himself together.

164
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't let me affect him.

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,400
One more thing,

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
Hongjun has a promising future.

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,240
As he gets promoted,

168
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,840
there will be

169
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
more and more temptation.

170
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,120
He is a smart guy.

171
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,040
But the smarter a guy is,
the more likely he is to make mistakes

172
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
and think highly of himself.

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,680
You know him the best.

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Remind him of that

175
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
when you get a chance.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,800
OK.

177
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
You're back, honey.

178
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,880
I went to your campus today.

179
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,960
Your colleagues told me

180
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,160
you left immediately after class.

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
Where have you been?

182
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
Chunsheng said that

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
he should have listened to me
and not bothered you.

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
Now he got you into trouble.

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
He felt guilty.

186
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,240
He also said that

187
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,600
you were his good friend and buddy.

188
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
You never hid anything from each other.

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,760
You told him everything.

190
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
And also, you had a promising future.

191
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,120
Did you see Xiao Chunsheng?

192
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
Do you feel ashamed?

193
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
Did you tell him everything?

194
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,280
Ye Fang,

195
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
how could you betray me?

196
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,960
Chen Hongjun, how can you
shift the blame to me?

197
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
Since you became

198
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
the president
of the Student Union in college,

199
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
you've never admitted any mistakes.

200
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
You would blame everything on others.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,640
Is that so hard to

202
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
admit your mistakes and apologize?

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Why should I apologize?

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Why should I?

205
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
People who get in
using their connections

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
are all timid at work,

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,320
lest make trouble.

208
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,280
What about Xiao Chunsheng?

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
He stood up for others

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
and put me on the opposite side
of my superior.

211
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,680
Has he ever considered me?

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
Honestly, do you regret it?

213
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,800
Ye Fang, I think you regret it.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,440
If you hadn't put on the show
with me in the first place,

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,600
you must have had a meteoric rise.

216
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,280
Then you needn't bother to

217
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
educate me like I'm your son.

218
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,760
(Learning that Ye Fang
had seen Xiao Chunsheng,)

219
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,280
(Chen Hongjun was worried.)

220
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
(He made up an excuse
to visit Xiao Chunsheng.)

221
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Hongjun,

222
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,680
sit down.

223
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
(Seeing that he was normal,)

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,600
(Chen Hongjun felt relieved.)

225
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,620
(Unit One)

226
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
If I don't have to prepare for the exam,

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
I'll go to Yunnan with you.

228
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,080
Just focus

229
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,400
on your exam.

230
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
We can go anytime

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
when you want to.

232
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,320
OK.

233
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
You should enjoy a diversion.

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,720
I just miss my comrades-in-arms.

235
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,400
I want to see them.

236
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Feel free to go.

237
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,680
I'll visit Yanqiu and Tian

238
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,360
whenever I have time. Don't worry.

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,360
Xiaomei,

240
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm so lucky to have you.

241
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,280
(He Hongling was under)

242
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
(great pressure in the new band.)

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
(To establish her position
as the concertmaster,)

244
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
(He Hongling, competitive as always,)

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,440
(kept practicing
without sleeping or eating.)

246
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,880
Hongling.

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,000
Hongling.

248
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,240
Hongling.

249
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
What's wrong with you?

250
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Don't you know she's pregnant?

251
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
It's OK.

252
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,300
(In Surgery Silence Operating Room)

253
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,760
The patient is bleeding profusely!

254
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't worry.

255
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
We'll have another baby.

256
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
Chief Duan, you have a visitor.

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
Lei.

258
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,000
Chunsheng!

259
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,360
Since when have you

260
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,480
learned surprising attack?

261
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,080
Chief Duan, keep up your appearance.

262
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,680
Sit down.

263
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Let me get you some water.

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,920
Can you tell me

265
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,520
why you didn't inform me
before you came to Yunnan?

266
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,240
I could've picked you up at the station.

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
We're good friends.

268
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,040
You don't have to bother.

269
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,600
Have some water.

270
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,560
After demobilization, it took me
some time to recover from my injuries.

271
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,200
When my leg got well,

272
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,720
since the Organization recognized
my professional ability,

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
they transferred me
to the Criminal Police Unit.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,720
We work day and night here.

275
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
Our work is more exhausting than yours.

276
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,920
What about you?

277
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,680
How do you get along with Xiaomei?

278
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,000
When will you get married?

279
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,880
We'll

280
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,680
get married sooner or later.

281
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,760
I just want to find the right time

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,480
to visit her parents
and ask their permission.

283
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,080
In fact,

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
I've always thought that

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Xiaomei is more suitable for you.

286
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Well,

287
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
you haven't told me

288
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,200
why you suddenly come to Yunnan?

289
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
What happened?

290
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
Nothing happened.

291
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,720
I just missed you guys.

292
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920
So I come to see you.

293
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
Missed us?

294
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,200
You must have something on your mind.

295
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,800
You know what,

296
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,520
when one starts to recall the old days,

297
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,200
it means that he's dissatisfied
with his current life.

298
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
I just don't understand.

299
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,000
When we were young,

300
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,640
we hung out together all day long.

301
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,440
We were as close as brothers.

302
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,080
For our comrades and brothers,

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,720
we would even sacrifice our lives.

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
But now,

305
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
for the sake of money,

306
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,520
my former friend

307
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,350
smuggled goods under my name.

308
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
For the sake of power,

309
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,560
my best buddy

310
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,520
contrived to set me up

311
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,070
and forced me out of
the Anti-smuggling Squad.

312
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,680
You do understand.

313
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,400
You just don't want to face it.

314
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,120
People

315
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,480
will change.

316
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Have you been possessed
by Qian Amao?

317
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,200
You seem so deep.

318
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,040
Forget about me.

319
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
What about you?

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,840
The work here isn't easier

321
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,160
than when you were in the military.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,800
Could your legs

323
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,840
stand it?

324
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,480
I'm fine.

325
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I've recovered well.

326
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,680
I have no problems with walking,

327
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,800
running, or jumping.

328
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
But when it's cloudy or rainy,

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,040
I always feel

330
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
bloating and pain.

331
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,160
Didn't you go to the hospital?

332
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah, I went to
the Military Region Hospital.

333
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,440
The doctor said the steel screws
they put in my leg

334
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
had deformed.

335
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,800
They couldn't take them out.

336
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,600
I have to endure it.

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Now they use

338
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,800
titanium screws in surgeries.

339
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,920
If we had such screws at that time,

340
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
my leg might

341
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,640
fully recover.

342
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
I may not be demobilized.

343
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,560
It really makes me upset

344
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
on hearing such things.

345
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,000
The lack of rehabilitation devices

346
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,160
in China has made

347
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
many patients

348
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,800
miss the best time for their treatment.

349
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,720
Take my fellow patients

350
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,080
at the rehabilitation center in Beijing
for example,

351
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,000
they're supposed to have the chance

352
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,080
to recover,

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
but owing to the lack of devices,

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
they have to use them in turn,

355
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,400
which delays their treatment.

356
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
So what?

357
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,840
Can you solve the problem?

358
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,280
I'm just thinking

359
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
if I can do something about it.

360
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,160
Forget it.

361
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Don't think too much.

362
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
That's not what we should think.

363
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,200
You worry about too many things.

364
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,360
Let's just take care of ourselves.

365
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
What's your plan for this afternoon?

366
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,320
I came to see you
as soon as I arrived in Kunming.

367
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,560
I want to visit
Amao's grave this afternoon.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
By the way, Chunsheng,

369
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,320
do you remember

370
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,200
the jewelry merchant, Xiang Nan,

371
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,440
we saved before?

372
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,960
Yes.

373
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,560
Xiang Nan has a big business now.

374
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,240
He is a famous jewelry merchant

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,280
in Kunming.

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,720
I'm not surprised

377
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,280
to hear that.

378
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,040
Lei, do you remember

379
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,280
he would risk his life

380
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,760
for a stone?

381
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah.

382
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
He is a man

383
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,000
with vision and courage.

384
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,920
He also keeps old friendship in mind.

385
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
Do you still keep in touch with him?

386
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
Sure.

387
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
He has never forgotten that
we saved his life.

388
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
He comes to see me now and then,

389
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
having a drink and chatting with me.

390
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,520
He asked about you many times.

391
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,280
He said he wanted to repay you

392
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,840
when he got a chance.

393
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
He doesn't have to do that.

394
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,880
I just did what a soldier should do.

395
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
Chunsheng,

396
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
to be honest with you,

397
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,280
Xiang Nan is a good man.

398
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
He deserves to be your friend.

399
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,880
I think

400
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,760
since you're here in Yunnan,

401
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
you may go see him as well.

402
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,440
No, thanks.

403
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,240
If I go see him,

404
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,400
he'll thank me a million.

405
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,920
I can't afford that.

406
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,440
After so many years, Chunsheng,

407
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,480
you're still so proud.

408
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,960
A leopard cannot change its spots.

409
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,880
Alright.

410
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,960
Suit yourself.

411
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,200
You go look around

412
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
this afternoon.

413
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,760
I'll give you a welcome dinner
at the old place.

414
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,600
OK. Let's

415
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
get drunk tonight.

416
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,600
Amao,

417
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,480
don't worry.

418
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,660
(Tomb of Martyr Qian Amao)

419
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,320
Lianfang and Heidou

420
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
are fine.

421
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,880
I wire them money regularly.

422
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,040
I'll take care of them for you.

423
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,820
(Tomb of Martyr Qian Amao)

424
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
Bye.

425
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,900
(Tomb of Martyr Meng Jinzhu)

426
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,080
Talk to him patiently.

427
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah.

428
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,400
There should be no problem.

429
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,760
Lei.

430
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
Comrade Xiao.

431
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
Comrade Xiao.

432
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,960
My life savior,

433
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,200
I finally see you.

434
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,880
I invited Xiang Nan.

435
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,240
We're old friends.

436
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,720
You rarely come to Yunnan.

437
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
If I didn't tell him,

438
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,120
he would blame me.

439
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,600
Sure.

440
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,720
Come on.

441
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,480
Don't stand there.

442
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,920
Sit.

443
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,320
Alright. Sit down, please.

444
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Sit. Sit.

445
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,800
Comrade Xiao,

446
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
it has been around six years

447
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,800
since we parted in Kunming.

448
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,800
Here.

449
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,080
By the way,

450
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I heard you were injured
on the battlefield.

451
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,800
How about it?

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Have you recovered?

453
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
I'm well now.

454
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,680
Don't call him Comrade Xiao.

455
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,520
It sounds aloof.

456
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,680
We're old acquaintances.

457
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,680
Just call him Chunsheng.

458
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,720
How dare I?

459
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,160
Why dare you not?

460
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,800
You're older than Duan Lei and me.

461
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,280
From now on, you are

462
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,320
our big brother.

463
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,480
OK.

464
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,800
Well.

465
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,320
I'll call you

466
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,000
Chunsheng.

467
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,680
Cheers.

468
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,360
Cheers.

469
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,680
Lei,

470
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,920
say it.

471
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,240
Say what?

472
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,400
You didn't invite Xiang Nan over

473
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
to talk about the old days, right?

474
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,360
You're

475
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,480
really a smart guy.

476
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,520
I can't hide anything from you.

477
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
Cut to the chase, OK?

478
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
You're right. Today,

479
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
I invited Xiang Nan over

480
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,080
because I have an idea.

481
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,760
What idea?

482
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,320
Chunsheng,

483
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,640
these years,

484
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,880
I've kept in touch with

485
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,960
Guohua, Hongling, and Xiaomei.

486
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
I know more or less about

487
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
your life in Beijing.

488
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
Your life isn't easy.

489
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Lei, I'll be honest with you.

490
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,800
About the purpose of my trip,

491
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,800
for one thing, I want to see Amao.

492
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,960
For another,

493
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,640
I want to see you

494
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
for relaxation.

495
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You'll make
great achievements, Chunsheng.

496
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
I don't need to

497
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
comfort you.

498
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
You just haven't

499
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
found your way in life.

500
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,800
As long as you find it,

501
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,200
I believe

502
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,000
you'll bounce back quickly.

503
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,440
You're right.

504
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,640
But I don't know what I can do.

505
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,520
Perhaps Xiang Nan

506
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
can show you the way.

507
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Do you want me

508
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,640
to cooperate with him?

509
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,640
That's exactly what I think.

510
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,160
Chunsheng, Xiang Nan
talked with me many times.

511
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,240
His business keeps expanding.

512
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,320
He always wants to
expand his jewelry business

513
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,440
to the Beijing market.

514
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
But he doesn't have a friend

515
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
who can help him to enter the market.

516
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
That reminded me of you.

517
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,680
But at that time,

518
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,720
you were working with
the Anti-smuggling Squad.

519
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,120
So I didn't bring it up.

520
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
But it's different now.

521
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,560
I told you that

522
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,160
Xiang Nan deserved to be your friend.

523
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,520
You have

524
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
many friends, relatives and

525
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,880
connections in Beijing.

526
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,720
If you guys work together,

527
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,440
you'll be a heaven-made union.

528
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,040
You'll make great achievements.

529
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,640
But I don't know anything about

530
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,720
jade or jewelry.

531
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,840
Moreover,

532
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,040
you said that

533
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,680
Xiang Nan was a big boss.

534
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Look at me.

535
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,840
I have no money or power.

536
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
Why would he cooperate with me?

537
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,080
Why?

538
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,600
Because you're Xiao Chunsheng.

539
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,080
And you know what,

540
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,400
if Xiang Nan knows you're
willing to help him,

541
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
he'll go wild with joy.

542
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,000
Forget it.

543
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,640
You know me.

544
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
I don't like to
take advantage of others.

545
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,560
Don't refuse so quickly.

546
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
Just now at the dinner table,

547
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,120
Xiang Nan asked us to visit his shop

548
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
tomorrow afternoon

549
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,000
to have some tea.

550
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,720
Let's go visit him

551
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,160
and listen to what he says.

552
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,720
Then you can make your decision.

553
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,520
OK.

554
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,160
Go.

555
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,080
Doctor,

556
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,200
I've gone through the formalities.

557
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,720
My wife will
leave the hospital tomorrow.

558
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Are there any

559
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,520
dos and don'ts when we get home?

560
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
I've written everything here.

561
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
You should pay attention.

562
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,440
By the way,

563
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
you should care more about your wife.

564
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,160
Definitely. No worries.

565
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,040
May I ask

566
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,600
when my wife can get pregnant again?

567
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,680
Neither of us knew about her pregnancy,

568
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,680
or I would take good care of her.

569
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
I would never let her suffer.

570
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,520
That doesn't sound right.

571
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,040
Before the curettage,

572
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,000
she said she had taken folic acid.

573
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
She must know she was pregnant.

574
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,000
You knew it,

575
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,400
right?

576
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,280
Why?

577
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,020
(Kunnan Fang)

578
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,920
This is the first-class Pu'er tea.

579
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,200
Have a try.

580
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,400
Great tea.

581
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,000
You know what, Chunsheng,

582
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Nan is

583
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,000
one of the top jewelers in Kunming.

584
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,400
He has four or five shops
in Kunming alone,

585
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,000
not to mention
his jade processing workshops.

586
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,360
In Tengchong,

587
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,320
there are suppliers

588
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,720
providing raw jadeite for him.

589
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,600
Nan, you have such a booming business.

590
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm happy for you.

591
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
You've given me

592
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
everything I have today.

593
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Don't say that.

594
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,080
If it weren't for you,
Duan Lei, and Hongling,

595
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,560
I would have died on the street.

596
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
How could I get this far?

597
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Alright, enough.

598
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,360
I come to drink tea today,

599
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,480
not to hear how grateful you are.

600
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,880
OK.

601
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,320
Drink tea.

602
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
To tell the truth,

603
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
even if you didn't come,

604
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,360
I would go to Beijing to see you.

605
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Xiang Nan,

606
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,640
have you decided to
help Chunsheng already?

607
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,800
What do you think?

608
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,640
You are a policeman,

609
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
not a businessman.

610
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
To be honest,

611
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,680
I've thought it over.

612
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,440
I just

613
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,520
want you to act as a go-between
for me and Chunsheng.

614
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,600
If Chunsheng wasn't in Beijing,

615
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,560
I wouldn't come up with the idea.

616
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Nan, I'm flattered.

617
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,600
Chunsheng,

618
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,480
what is Beijing?

619
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
It's the capital of China

620
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,800
with a tremendous market
and unlimited business opportunities.

621
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,240
Businessmen all over China

622
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,920
want to expand
their business to Beijing.

623
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,400
However,

624
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,960
it's too difficult

625
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,560
to enter the market.

626
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,360
Do you know what's the difficult point?

627
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,880
To find a helper,

628
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,600
a capable,

629
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,520
good and reliable helper.

630
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm so lucky

631
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
to have such a friend

632
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,560
as Chunsheng in Beijing.

633
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,320
But let me get this straight.

634
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,720
I didn't want to go to Beijing

635
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,720
to return your favor.

636
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,640
I wanted to

637
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,680
ask a favor

638
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,360
of you.

639
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,640
Nan,

640
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,200
what capability do I have to help you?

641
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,000
Chunsheng,

642
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
in my mind,

643
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,200
you're upstanding and loyal to friends.

644
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,920
And Duan Lei told me that

645
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
you had many friends and
a wide range of contacts in Beijing.

646
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,080
Who else can help me if you can't?

647
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,560
Where can I find

648
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
such a reliable and
trustworthy friend as you?

649
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,080
Yeah, Chunsheng.

650
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,000
Xiang Nan is sincere and earnest.

651
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,440
Do you have the heart

652
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,360
to turn him down?

653
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,880
Nan,

654
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,560
you may strike it rich
or go broke overnight.

655
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,840
You may dress in rags

656
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,400
or live an extravagant life suddenly.

657
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,520
It's pure gamble.

658
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm not interested

659
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,400
in your business.

660
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,320
You don't seem to

661
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,040
know our business well.

662
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,800
Yeah.

663
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,400
I got rich by gambling raw jadeite.

664
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,640
But that was my first bucket of gold.

665
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,840
I...

666
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,960
Duan Lei,

667
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,680
it seems necessary for us

668
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,080
to teach Comrade Chunsheng

669
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,720
Chinese jade culture.

670
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Exactly.

671
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,760
It's time to enlighten this fellow.

672
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,800
The way you echo each other

673
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,640
makes me feel
it's some abstruse knowledge.

674
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,400
So,

675
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,000
do you want to teach me a lesson?

676
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
OK. I'm free today.

677
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,600
I'll listen respectfully.

678
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,160
What is jade?

679
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,800
In Origin of Chinese Characters
compiled by Xu Shen,

680
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,200
it says "Jade,
the beautification of stone."

681
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,720
In modern Chinese,

682
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,720
it means "jade is the beautiful stone."

683
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,080
Of course,

684
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,880
this is the simplest definition.

685
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
Gold comes from minerals,

686
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,680
while jade is born from stones.

687
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,240
Without disillusionment,
one cannot achieve the true essence.

688
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,800
But those who talk about jade

689
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,400
may not truly appreciate
the true essence of jade.

690
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,440
So what's the true essence of jade?

691
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,160
Actually, Confucius had already defined it.

692
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,000
Benevolence, righteousness,
wisdom, purity, and courage

693
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,520
are the five virtues of jade.

694
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,640
In traditional Chinese culture,

695
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,760
jade is the crystal of heaven and earth,

696
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
which has life and spirituality.

697
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,440
But the ancients also said that

698
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,120
the beautiful essence of jade
hides in stones.

699
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,760
Without carving or polishing,
it's no different from rubble.

700
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,440
So jade must be carved.

701
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,600
As the old saying goes,

702
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,200
jade unwrought can do nothing useful.

703
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,480
Stop. Stop.

704
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,760
Are you still the man I know

705
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
who ran for his life
holding a stone in his arms?

706
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,640
What do you mean?

707
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,120
Well,

708
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,120
he doesn't sound like
a jewelry merchant.

709
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,120
He's even profounder than a professor.

710
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Nan,

711
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,640
since when have you become so profound?

712
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,960
Are you making fun of him, Chunsheng?

713
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm telling you,

714
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,040
no matter what you do,

715
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,320
if you don't know well about

716
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,520
the origin and culture

717
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,800
of your business,

718
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,880
you can't do it well.

719
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
My family has been dealing with

720
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,280
emeralds and jade for generations.

721
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,080
I've been influenced since childhood.

722
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,440
So I'm interested in jade culture.

723
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,080
You can call it inheritance

724
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
or passion.

725
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,880
Anyway,

726
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,280
I think I'll spend my life

727
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,400
with these

728
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,360
beautiful stones.

729
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,150
And you know what?

730
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,670
The traditional Chinese jade culture

731
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,840
is vast and profound.

732
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,520
It's enough for me
to study for a lifetime.

733
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,190
Don't interrupt.

734
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,560
Listen carefully.

735
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,600
OK.

736
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,670
I'll listen.

737
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,150
OK.

738
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,360
Look...

739
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,040
(Xiaomei,)

740
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,670
(I've been in Kunming for several days.)

741
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,680
(Do you remember the jade merchant)

742
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,200
(I saved on the street of Kunming,)

743
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,760
(Xiang Nan?)

744
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,800
(He and Duan Lei)

745
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,120
(are my teachers now.)

746
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
(They give me lessons every day,)

747
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,000
(teaching me Chinese jade culture.)

748
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,200
(Xiang Nan often says,)

749
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,440
(observe one's heart mirrored in jade;)

750
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,400
(nurture one's virtue with jade;)

751
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,800
(and advance the grand elegance
of the country with jade.)

752
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
(You always ask me)

753
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,400
(to follow my heart.)

754
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,760
(But the premise of following my heart)

755
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,800
(is to ease my mind.)

756
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,040
(I suddenly feel that)

757
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,920
(it may be fate that)

758
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,080
(brings me to Xiang Nan.)

759
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,800
(Heaven makes me stop)

760
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,000
(to consider what I really want.)

761
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,760
(Xiaomei,)

762
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,800
(I miss you.)

763
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
(When I'm ready,)

764
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,360
(I'll go back.)

765
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,560
(Chunsheng,)

766
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
(I hope you're well.)

767
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,800
(I've always believed you)

768
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,600
(and your judgment.)

769
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,400
(I believe you can achieve
whatever you want to do.)

770
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,880
(You know,)

771
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,400
(no matter what decision you make,)

772
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,880
(I'll support you unconditionally.)

773
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
(I have good news to tell you.)

774
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,720
(I took part in
the qualification certificate test.)

775
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,600
(The director of the rehab center
promised me that)

776
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,840
(I could start working
when I got the certificate.)

777
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,480
(At that time,)

778
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,840
(I can help more people.)

779
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,760
(You know what,)

780
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
(I love it when we)

781
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,360
(work hard together.)

782
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,580
(Day and Night Shop)

783
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,840
Hello.

784
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,120
You're...

785
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,200
We're with the Anti-smuggling Squad.

786
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,240
We got a tip

787
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,440
saying that the cigarettes
in your shop were smuggled

788
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,120
and illegal.

789
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,560
We need you to come with us

790
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,320
for investigation.

791
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,240
Are you kidding me?

792
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
(Tobacco Monopoly Retail License)
I have a license here.

793
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
It can't be fake, right?

794
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,000
And all my cigarettes are

795
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,840
purchased from legitimate channels.

796
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,360
We'll verify your license later.

797
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
But we've confirmed that

798
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,680
your supply channel is illegal.

799
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,640
Do you know Guo Heizi?

800
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,560
Yes, I know.

801
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,560
Is he the supplier of your cigarettes?

802
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah.

803
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,280
We've confirmed through investigation

804
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,080
that all his cigarettes are
smuggled and illegally purchased.

805
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
He's been detained by the police.

806
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
How could it be possible?

807
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,840
Now we need you to come with us

808
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,680
for investigation.

809
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,220
(Day and Night Shop)

810
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,920
Are you OK?

811
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,720
Don't keep it secret.

812
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,280
I already heard of it.

813
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
No big deal.

814
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,880
I wasn't going to hide it anyway.

815
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,240
I just went there

816
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,840
to tell them everything I know.

817
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
Is that all?

818
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
Mrs. Zhang told me that

819
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,720
the police accused us
of colluding with smugglers.

820
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,720
Colluding with smugglers?

821
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,200
I'm the smuggler.

822
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,680
Mrs. Zhang

823
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,240
is garrulous.

824
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,960
Everyone knows that.
Don't listen to her nonsense.

825
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,760
Your main task now is to

826
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,040
take good care of yourself.

827
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,080
Don't worry about other things.

828
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,920
I'll handle it.

829
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
But I'm worried about you.

830
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,520
Don't worry.

831
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,160
It'll be fine.

832
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,320
You go home first.

833
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,440
I'll wind up today's business.

834
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,680
Come back early.

835
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
What do you think, Chunsheng?

836
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,560
Xiang Nan and I took turns
giving you lessons in the past few days.

837
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,560
We also took you to visit

838
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
his other shops and
jade processing workshops.

839
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
It took us a hell of talking.

840
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,560
You should

841
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,560
give us an answer today.

842
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,680
Nan, to be honest,

843
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,840
I've felt your sincerity

844
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,080
in working together with me.

845
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,440
After spending
the past few days with you,

846
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
I think you are a well-educated,

847
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,280
far-sighted,

848
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,240
and sincere man.

849
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,160
It's my honor

850
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,680
to be friends with you.

851
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,600
So,

852
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
do you agree to help me?

853
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,680
I want to hear

854
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,480
how you want me to help.

855
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,800
Currently, almost all jewelry and
jade business

856
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,360
in Beijing is run by

857
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
Beijing Arts and Crafts Corporation.

858
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,880
The state-owned corporation,

859
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,560
which is not only

860
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
the largest in Beijing but also in China,

861
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,520
runs a business of arts and crafts.

862
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
It sells various products

863
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,240
with subordinate factories

864
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,360
processing all kinds of

865
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,560
art and craft products.

866
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,720
It's very large.

867
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,160
You're good.

868
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,640
You know well about
the situation in Beijing.

869
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,240
To be honest,

870
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,240
I've been thinking for a long time

871
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
about entering the Beijing market.

872
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,240
As you soldiers say,

873
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
knowing oneself and one's enemy
ensures victory.

874
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,000
Nan, go on.

875
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,160
If we want to enter the Beijing market,

876
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,600
we must contact the people from

877
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Beijing Arts and Crafts Corporation

878
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,480
and cooperate with them.

879
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,120
Chunsheng,

880
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,440
if you can bring us
into contact with them,

881
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,520
the gate of the Beijing market

882
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,520
will open to us.

883
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,760
Nan, if you say so,

884
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,960
I have a childhood friend

885
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,960
from the military compound
of the air command.

886
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,520
After demobilization,

887
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,360
he works in
the Arts and Crafts Corporation.

888
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,840
I'll visit him when I return to Beijing.

889
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,040
Perhaps he can help us.

890
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,080
Great!

891
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,760
See?

892
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,680
I told you that

893
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,200
there was nothing in Beijing
that Chunsheng couldn't do.

894
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,280
Yeah.

895
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,120
I've found the right guy.

896
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,040
It's against the will of Heaven

897
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,280
if we don't work together.

898
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,080
Chunsheng,

899
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
hurry up.

900
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,040
For what?

901
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,760
Cooperation.

902
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,000
What's the hurry?

903
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
Well, Chunsheng,

904
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,200
you just gave me a ray of hope.

905
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,400
You wouldn't break it, would you?

906
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Nan, don't worry.

907
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,120
I'll tell you what,

908
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
forget about our cooperation first.

909
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
When I return to Beijing,

910
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,080
I'll go to see my friend.

911
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
If he can bring us

912
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,040
into contact with the corporation,

913
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,080
we'll work together.

914
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,520
If he can't,

915
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,400
don't blame me.

916
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
I'm willing to help but unable to do so.

917
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,320
See, Xiang,

918
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,400
that's what Xiao Chunsheng does.

919
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,840
Exactly.

920
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,640
Steady and down to earth.

921
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
He's born to do great deeds.

922
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,520
Don't flatter me, you guys.

923
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
I've been in Kunming
for quite a few days.

924
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,400
I'll return to Beijing tomorrow.

925
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,520
Nan, wait for my news.

926
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,320
When I make a deal with them,

927
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,120
I'll inform you as soon as possible.
