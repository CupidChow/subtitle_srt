=Episode 18=

3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,800
I know the life I want

4
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,760
and who I am

5
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,960
very well.

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,160
Please don't bother.

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,960
Thank you for this money.

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,180
Yanqiu.

9
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,420
She just fell asleep.

10
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,740
Did you lose weight?

11
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
You should take care of yourself.

12
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,260
Now your mom is sick

13
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,340
and she needs you to be well.

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,900
I understand.

15
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,900
Thank you, Yanqiu.

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,220
Thank you, Yanqiu.

17
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,580
You are welcome.

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,900
By the way,

19
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,620
Chunsheng just

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,540
sent this money home.

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,100
It's his saving all these years

22
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,100
and my dad's pension.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,860
And he borrowed some
from his comrades-in-arms.

24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,380
Although I know it's not much,

25
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,620
you can

26
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,940
pay the medical bills with it first.

27
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,260
And we'll figure out a way for the rest.

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,420
Take it.

29
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,740
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

30
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,020
(Reception Office)

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,780
OK, take good care of your mom.

32
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,100
All right.

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,900
What's on your mind?

34
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,860
What could I have on my mind?

35
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,100
It's getting late.

36
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,300
Time to go to bed.

37
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,820
Is the money not enough?

38
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,340
It's not that.

39
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,660
When my sister told Hongling
that I borrowed some money,

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,620
she mentioned that

41
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,460
part of it was my dad's pension.

42
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,500
So Hongling refused to accept the money.

43
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,140
But she still needs money.

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,100
How was the problem solved in the end?

45
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,340
Platoon Leader Ye lent it to her.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,220
Chunsheng, I know that

47
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,140
you like her

48
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,740
and she likes you,

49
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,940
but I think there's a big gap
between the two of you.

50
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,580
Forgive me for saying that.

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,780
Anyway, it seems to me

52
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
that you two are
not the same kind of people.

53
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,340
Really.

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,340
Now you don't see the problem

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,220
because you are still in love.

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,500
You are carried away by it,

57
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,020
so of course you can't see the problem.

58
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,300
But when one day,

59
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,980
she who is mature enough

60
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,940
will definitely complain
about your immaturity,

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,780
and how you are like a child

62
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,100
who can't keep up with her pace.

63
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,180
And by that time,

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,940
she will probably choose

65
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,500
to give up on you

66
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,380
for a more realistic life.

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,860
I work hard every day to improve.

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,420
What am I doing this for?

69
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,940
I just want the both of us

70
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,780
to be promoted as soon as possible,

71
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,700
so we can be together without worries.

72
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,500
I'm working hard

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,220
for our future,

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,260
but what are you doing?

75
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,020
There is such a good opportunity

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,780
right in front of you,

77
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,620
why don't you just grab it?

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,420
Have you considered
what others would think of Guohua?

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,660
The contest content he announced

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,420
is opposed by his best friend.

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,220
You are ruining his prestige, you know?

82
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,780
Chunsheng,

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
she is very likely gonna give up on you

84
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
because of your family situation.

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,380
That's nonsense.

86
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,820
Yeah,

87
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,420
I'm not that sure,

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,540
especially about her.

89
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,820
She's complicated.

90
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,740
But I've

91
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,660
always been a good judge of character.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,420
That's impossible.

93
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,660
You must be wrong this time.

94
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,900
You don't need to comfort me.

95
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,340
I know clearly in my heart that

96
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,260
I almost

97
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,540
lost my life this time.

98
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,660
I just got lucky.

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,820
But next time...

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,340
Mom, don't say that.

101
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,620
Come on, have some tangerine.

102
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,420
Hongling,

103
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,740
you should have

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,420
seen it clearly this time.

105
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,060
Nothing goes well to a destitute couple.

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,980
If it hadn't been for Guohua,

107
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,220
my surgery wouldn't
have been performed by

108
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,260
one of the best doctors in Beijing,

109
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,380
let alone getting such a nice ward.

110
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,940
I would have died, you know.

111
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,900
Don't say that.

112
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,260
You are safe and sound now.

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm not being a pessimist,

114
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
but I'm old.

115
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,540
If this kind of thing happens again,

116
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,540
I don't know if I can make it.

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm not considering myself.

118
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,860
At this age,

119
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,860
I have lived long enough in this world.

120
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,340
I am just worried about you.

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,740
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I made.

122
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,180
When it comes to a man,

123
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,660
it doesn't matter
how admirable he is outside.

124
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,420
He has to be able to
earn money, make progress,

125
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,460
and give you a comfortable life.

126
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,300
This is what a good man should do.

127
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,700
Don't worry about it.

128
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,740
All will be good.

129
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm still young now.

130
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
You are old enough.

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,140
It's time for you
to think about your future.

132
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,460
The bottle is empty.

133
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,700
I'll call the nurse.

134
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,460
(About half a month
after He Hongling's mother)

135
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,620
(had her surgery,)

136
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,780
(some small-scale conflicts
began to happen at the border.)

137
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,900
(People's Daily)
(The whole army was on a war footing.)

138
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,140
(The elite soldiers
who had finished training)

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,340
(and had been formally incorporated)

140
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,740
(into the battle sequence
of the 11th Army)

141
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,580
(all asked for a battle assignment.)

142
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,900
Come in.

143
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,500
Director,

144
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,100
this is my application
for a battle assignment.

145
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,620
Have you discussed it with your family?

146
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,660
Not yet.

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,740
But my father taught me
since I was a child

148
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,220
that during the war years,

149
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,900
the duty of a soldier
is to defend the country

150
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,420
at the front line

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,580
regardless of personal safety.

152
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,140
I believe he will support me.

153
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,540
The front line is not like what you think.

154
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,980
Now,

155
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,700
are you mentally prepared?

156
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,300
I want to go to war,

157
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,180
and I'm not doing this on impulse.

158
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,620
I checked the information before.

159
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,340
I know that on the front line,

160
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,300
few wounded soldiers die of fetal wounds.

161
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,700
Most of them die

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,100
due to shortage of

163
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,020
medical supplies and medical personnel.

164
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,340
The casualties

165
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,380
are just not a number.

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,820
They also have relatives.

167
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,460
They are also sons,

168
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,580
husbands and fathers.

169
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,820
Their sacrifice

170
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,700
is often a tragedy for a family.

171
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,940
Maybe what I said

172
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,740
exaggerated my own strength,

173
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,820
but even if I save one person

174
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,220
on the front line,

175
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,260
I would be doing my part.

176
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,780
Besides,

177
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,980
I think doctors

178
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,860
should go to the place

179
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,340
where they are most needed.

180
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,780
This is what we are doing this for.

181
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,820
I'll accept your application.

182
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,140
Get prepared for it.

183
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,220
Thank you, sir!

184
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,100
(Director's Office)

185
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
The order has been given!

186
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,860
Our mission is clear!

187
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,620
We need to confirm
the enemy's artillery position

188
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,620
within twelve hours.

189
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,820
Comrades.

190
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,980
We are going to be tested!

191
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
The country and the people

192
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,940
are looking at us expectantly.

193
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
The Southwest has the best soldiers!

194
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,300
Show our muscle

195
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,580
and make the enemy fear!

196
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,660
Victory belongs to Chinese soldiers!

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,060
Show our muscle

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,180
and make the enemy fear!

199
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,580
Victory belongs to Chinese soldiers!

200
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,460
Sir,

201
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,180
the company commander telegraphed back.

202
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,980
What did he say?

203
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,180
He didn't approve our request for action.

204
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,220
He wants us to stop fighting

205
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
and retreat quickly,

206
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,500
and arrive at the designated place
at dawn the day after tomorrow.

207
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
We'll get another important task there.

208
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,740
Telegraph him again,

209
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
and tell him that the enemy's shrapnel

210
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,580
have caused us
serious losses in recent days.

211
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,540
When our army retreats later,

212
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,620
we have to go through this area again.

213
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,300
If we don't remove
this artillery position,

214
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,700
the consequences will be serious.

215
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,060
The enemy has frequently
used this weapon these two days.

216
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,100
We are sure that they are around here.

217
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,900
This is a great chance.

218
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,300
Maybe they will slip away tomorrow.

219
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,900
Yes!

220
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,420
Sir, the company commander

221
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,660
repeated his former

222
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,620
orders.

223
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,740
Assemble now

224
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,460
and get ready to retreat.

225
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,140
Sir,

226
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,140
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng was ordered
to go to the other side of the mountain

227
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,890
to look for the artillery location.

228
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,560
We have lost contact with him.

229
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,540
Telegraph the company commander

230
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,260
and tell him that Comrade Xiao Chunsheng

231
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,380
has gone deep into the enemy's territory,

232
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,420
and he will find

233
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,660
the enemy's artillery position soon.

234
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,420
Request to postpone the withdrawal time

235
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,860
and the time to
reach the designated location.

236
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,460
Yes!

237
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,060
Tell the company commander

238
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,940
that if we don't come back
by three o'clock,

239
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,620
he can lead the whole company

240
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,740
and retreat to the designated location.

241
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,300
Yes!

242
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,900
Sir!

243
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,540
Are you going to look for Chunsheng?

244
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,300
I am coming too.

245
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,380
Let's go.

246
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:58,940
You two,

247
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,740
come with me.

248
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,380
Yes.

249
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,780
Wait.

250
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,740
We don't have enough time for this.

251
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,620
Let's spread out.

252
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,300
Whether we can find him or not,

253
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,500
we must go back

254
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,660
before three o'clock.

255
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,340
Yes.

256
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,340
Spread out.

257
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,660
It's me, Chunsheng.

258
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,380
Guohua.

259
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,140
Don't be nervous.

260
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,780
Keep breathing.

261
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,660
Take it easy,

262
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,500
otherwise you will get tired soon,

263
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,380
and your feet

264
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,420
will soon be out of control.

265
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,620
US-made M16

266
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,460
bounding anti-personnel mine.

267
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,300
Right.

268
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
There is often a trap mine

269
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,060
below this kind of mine.

270
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
If you remove the top one,

271
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,900
the one below it will explode.

272
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,340
You are not a sapper and have no tools,

273
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,100
you can't remove it.

274
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,260
No, there is another way.

275
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,940
Don't worry.

276
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,180
This kind of little trick can't beat us.

277
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,020
We have learned it in the training class.

278
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,900
Just don't move.

279
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,900
I'll take this as an exercise.

280
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,700
Chunsheng,

281
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,620
I was the lecturer of the training class,

282
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
I know what this is.

283
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,740
The enemy changed
the compression spring of this mine.

284
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,700
Now it's more sensitive.

285
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,420
A slight change in pressure
will make it explode.

286
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,180
Besides,

287
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
there's a trap mine,

288
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,740
and we don't know what kind it is.

289
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
You know what I mean?

290
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,820
I don't!

291
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,540
We don't need to

292
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,820
die together here.

293
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,580
Shut up!

294
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,980
If you die,

295
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,900
what will Hongling do?

296
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,300
Chunsheng,

297
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,380
I just can't let Hongling go.

299
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,180
I love her.

300
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,100
The thought that she's with you

301
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,620
makes me so awful

302
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,940
and so jealous of you.

303
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,780
But how can I be jealous of you?

304
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,140
You are my best friend.

305
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,460
You know what?

306
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I always had a dream.

307
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,780
In it, at Shichahai,

308
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,820
when Heizi asked

309
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,740
who was Ye Guohua,

310
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
I didn't flinch.

311
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,980
I stepped forward.

312
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,700
This time,

313
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,460
I won't flinch no matter what.

314
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm pretty lucky, Chunsheng.

315
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,900
I'm glad to have the chance
to say these words before I die.

316
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,660
I feel so good

317
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,620
after saying these.

318
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,540
And I

319
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,260
no longer feel

320
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,140
I owe you and Hongling so much.

321
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,260
Chunsheng, listen.

322
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,620
Just go.

323
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,100
We'll still be best friends
in the next life.

324
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,020
Chunsheng,

325
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,020
I order you to leave immediately!

326
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,340
Shut up!

327
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
What are you doing, Chunsheng?

328
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,820
Don't do it, Chunsheng!

329
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,780
I said shut up!

330
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,340
Stop bothering me!

331
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,340
Lift your foot.

332
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,860
Chunsheng.

333
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,060
I said lift your foot!

334
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,100
Guohua.

335
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,460
Step back for at least ten meters.

336
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,140
Do not run.

337
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Watch your step.

338
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,500
Guohua,

339
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,380
come back the same way.

340
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,140
Watch your step.

341
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,100
Take this.

342
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,820
This is the coordinates of

343
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,980
the enemy's M101 howitzers.

344
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,740
Take it back and report it
to the regiment headquarters.

345
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,820
Don't even waste a minute.

346
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,820
They could move at any moment.

347
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,130
OK. Just go.

348
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,860
What about you?

349
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,140
After you do your job,

350
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,740
send Cai of the sapper unit

351
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,180
to come and rescue me with tools.

352
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,380
There is no other way.

353
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,380
This is the enemy's territory.

354
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
Enemies may appear at any time.

355
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,500
It doesn't matter if we both die,

356
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,300
but if it delays
the delivery of the information,

357
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,540
our deaths will be in vain.

358
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,500
Chunsheng.

359
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,540
Hang on.

360
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Don't move.

361
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,580
I will be back soon.

362
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Don't worry.

363
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,020
With this thing under my foot,

364
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,900
even mosquitoes dare not bite me.

365
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,900
Go!

366
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,460
Guo! Guo!

367
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,180
This is the coordinates

368
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,300
of the enemy's howitzers.

369
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,500
Telegraph the company commander
to inform the artillery regiment

370
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,100
to knock it out immediately!

371
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Yes.

372
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Where is Chunsheng?

373
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,020
Duan Lei.

374
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,300
Take five or six men and come with me.

375
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,180
Cai.

376
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,740
Sir!

377
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,340
Tell the sappers

378
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,060
to bring their tools.

379
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,740
Let's go first!

380
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,420
Yes, sir!

381
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,980
Chunsheng stepped on a mine?

382
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,140
Let's go.

383
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,620
(During this mission,)

384
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,860
(the elite squad
suffered heavy casualties.)

385
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,900
(Meng Jinzhu and Qian Amao)

386
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,660
(lost their lives.)

387
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,060
Come on, get the wounded.

388
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,980
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

389
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,300
Get the wounded.

390
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,860
Get the wounded.

391
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,460
OK.

392
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,740
Take it easy.

393
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,980
Check his wounds.

394
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,700
Check his wounds
and stop the bleeding now.

395
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,260
Quickly.

396
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,710
Don't panic. Take it easy.

397
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,620
OK. Take it easy.

398
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,860
- Go further. OK.
- Come on.

399
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,780
How is the company commander?

400
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,860
Easy.

401
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,580
Check his wounds.

402
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,300
Come on, bandage it up.

403
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,580
Quick.

404
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,180
Bandage the wound.

405
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,020
- Don't move, don't move.
- Doctor!

406
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,140
- Easy. Easy.
- Doctor!

407
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,660
Doctor!

408
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Make way!

409
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,060
Chunsheng.

410
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,060
Xiao Chunsheng!

411
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,460
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng, wake up!

412
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,780
Send him to the operating room!

413
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,460
OK. Move!

414
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,580
Make way! Make way!

415
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,540
- Make way!
- Make way!

416
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,780
Get out of the way!

417
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,460
Make way!

418
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,860
Make way!

419
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,820
Get the wounded!

420
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,460
Xiaomei.

421
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,220
Guohua?

422
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,700
How is Chunsheng doing?

423
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,060
Chunsheng suffered from a spinal injury.

424
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,100
The surgery went better than we expected.

425
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,900
The wound was treated successfully.

426
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,980
We'll have to wait until he wakes up
to see the rest.

427
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,340
There won't be any sequelae, right?

428
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,460
Will he be able to
continue serving in the army?

429
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,060
Any surgery has potential risks,

430
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,780
but don't worry too much.

431
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,260
You should have a good rest,

432
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,380
and then wait for him to wake up.

433
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,220
Can I see him?

434
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,970
I'm still a little worried.

435
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,460
Is the one lying inside really Chunsheng?

436
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,900
It's him,

437
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,980
right?

438
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,380
You finally woke up.

439
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,940
Xiaomei?

440
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,060
I...

441
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,540
Where am I?

442
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
How do you feel?

443
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,860
I'm still alive?

444
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,260
What are you talking about?

445
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,020
You've been in a coma for days.

446
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,940
You were injured
by landmines on the battlefield

447
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,340
and then sent here for treatment.

448
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,180
You are now out of danger.

449
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,740
Here.

450
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,660
(Kunming Railway Station)

451
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Hello, comrade.

452
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,580
- Have you seen Xiao Chunsheng?
- No, I haven't.

453
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,580
Hello, comrade.
Have you met Xiao Chunsheng?

454
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,300
I don't know him.

455
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,660
Comrade,

456
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,860
- have you seen Xiao Chunsheng?
- No.

457
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,500
Comrade, have you seen Xiao Chunsheng?

458
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,220
Hello, have you met Xiao Chunsheng?

459
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,700
No.

460
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,420
(Kunming Railway Station)

461
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,140
(Welcome the heroes to return in victory)

462
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,540
I haven't started yet.

463
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,820
You haven't started?

464
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,700
It's... It's impossible.

465
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,380
It hurts.

466
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
It really hurts.

467
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,660
Chunsheng,

468
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,540
are you afraid...

469
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,380
Hey, Doctor Tong,

470
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,940
how can you slander a wounded?

471
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,980
How about this?

472
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,580
Apply for some anesthetic for me.

473
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,580
We didn't use anesthetic

474
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,620
when you had that surgery last time.

475
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,820
You passed out in pain
but didn't make a sound.

476
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,380
Why are you so cowardly now?

477
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,380
Guohua. Guohua is here.

478
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,860
Xiaomei, you don't know,

479
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,380
he was afraid of needles
since he was a child.

480
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,340
One day, the school
organized us to get injections,

481
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,980
but he covered his butt with his hands

482
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,180
and rolled on the ground to avoid it.

483
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,980
Shut up.

484
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,220
Put that down and get out of here.

485
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,780
I was telling the truth.

486
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Give him the injection now, Xiaomei.

487
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,340
Sooner or later,

488
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,780
you have to get it.

489
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,100
Get lost.

490
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,380
I am not afraid of anything.

491
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,540
Really, I'm not afraid of anything.

492
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,420
Come on.

493
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,260
Do it now.

494
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,980
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng, I'll do it then.

495
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,940
Done?

496
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,820
Are you crying?

497
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,300
Shut up.

498
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,500
Take your time.

499
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,020
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Tong.

500
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,180
See you, Dr. Tong.

501
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,140
How do you feel?

502
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,380
I am totally fine.

503
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,380
Who am I? I am Xiao Chunsheng.

504
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,060
Nothing can bring me down.

505
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,580
That's the spirit.

506
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,460
I've been here several times these days,

507
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
but you were in a coma.

508
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,380
That was close.

509
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,540
By the way,

510
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,620
how is Duan Lei doing?

511
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,540
He was shot in his calf,

512
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,740
so his leg is broken.

513
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,340
He has two steel nails in it now.

514
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,540
He is the real man.

515
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,540
He wanted to come to visit you
with a broken leg.

516
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,900
But I stopped him.

517
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,460
He needs to recover

518
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,700
before he comes to visit me.

519
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,540
We can't afford to lose

520
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,700
any other man.

521
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,260
Chunsheng,

522
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,180
I sent the intelligence in time.

523
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,700
I saw it when they were

524
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,140
bombed.

525
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,660
Guohua, you have done
a great deed of merit this time.

526
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,220
The credit is yours.

527
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,620
After the information
was delivered that day,

528
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,500
I took people back for you.

529
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,380
But a big fire
was burning in the minefield.

530
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,100
The mines exploded one after the other.

531
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,420
I couldn't find you anywhere.

532
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,180
I thought...

533
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,300
What are you doing?

534
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,380
I'm not dead yet.

535
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,220
Don't be like that.

536
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,100
What exactly happened?

537
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,300
That day,

538
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,380
when we bombed their artillery position,

539
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,740
the enemy found me.

540
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Oh my goodness.

541
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,860
They shot at me
with rifles and submachine guns.

542
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,260
I hid in the grass
and didn't dare to move.

543
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,180
The point is I couldn't move at all.

544
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,380
Then they started shooting mortars.

545
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,940
They even used a flamethrower.

546
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,740
And then

547
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,860
I realized that

548
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,220
I would die no matter

549
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,620
if I move or not.

550
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,540
Then I thought

551
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,020
I should try to survive.

552
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,860
I pressed that spring

553
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,140
with my dagger.

554
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,660
Then I rolled to the side

555
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,420
with all my strength.

556
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,660
Guess what?

557
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,100
Nothing happened.

558
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,820
I felt so angry!

559
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,540
I was like,

560
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,700
we were almost scared to death

561
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,780
just by a dud?

562
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,980
But immediately,

563
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,260
that mine

564
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,860
exploded.

565
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,220
Luckily, it gave me a few seconds

566
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,700
for me to roll further.

567
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,100
I can't remember after that.

568
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,900
And when I woke up again,

569
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,580
I was here.

570
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,980
Chunsheng,

571
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,100
I owe you my life.

572
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,260
After going back to the army,

573
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,780
I will apply for
the title of Combat Hero for you.

574
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,340
That's not why we became soldiers.

575
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,140
You deserve it.

576
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,220
Alright.

577
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,940
Or maybe,

578
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,900
you can draw me a trophy.

579
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,740
By the way,

580
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,180
I heard our troops
were starting to withdraw.

581
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,980
That's right.

582
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,300
We did a great job.

583
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,940
The enemy has surrendered.

584
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,940
Our battalion is also preparing to leave.

585
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,540
You are wounded,

586
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,860
so you'll leave at least a few days later.

587
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,780
Good.

588
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,260
Very good.

589
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,460
Help me deliver a message to Hongling

590
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,020
and tell her not to worry.

591
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,460
As for Qian Amao,

592
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,580
there's some money
under my pillow in the dorm.

593
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,620
Remit it all to his family.

594
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,380
Alright,

595
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,300
don't worry about that.

596
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,900
Take a good rest

597
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,260
and return to the army
as soon as possible.

598
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,100
It's Platoon Leader Ye!

599
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,820
It's really him!

600
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,020
Platoon Leader Ye!

601
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,140
You are amazing!

602
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,980
You sneaked into
the enemy's territory alone

603
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,940
and brought back
the coordinates of the M101 position.

604
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,900
Platoon Leader Ye,

605
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,540
you are our hero!

606
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,340
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

607
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,420
Bravo!

608
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,700
(Kunming Railway Station)

609
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,740
Comrade, have you seen Xiao Chunsheng?

610
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,500
No.

611
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,620
Hello, Comrade,

612
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,140
have you seen Xiao Chunsheng?

613
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,940
Hongling.

614
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,180
Guohua?

615
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Welcome home, hero!

616
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,420
Where is Chunsheng?

617
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,220
Chunsheng...

618
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,660
Chunsheng asked me to say sorry to you.

619
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,940
What happened to him?

620
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,260
Hongling, don't worry.

621
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,100
Chunsheng is fine.

622
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,620
He was just wounded.

623
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,420
He has had surgery and is out of danger.

624
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,660
I think

625
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,300
he'll be transferred to the
Military Region Hospital in a few days.

626
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,740
He's wounded?

627
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,540
Is there a phone over there?

628
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,420
I don't think there is.

629
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,740
Don't worry, Hongling.

630
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,900
When Chunsheng is transferred,

631
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,300
I will take you to see him immediately.

632
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,940
(Outpatient)

633
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:38,620
(Dispensary
Nurse Station)

634
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,460
He had an
Open Spinal Cord Injury Debridement.

635
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
It's the tenth day after surgery.

636
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,820
His wounds are recovering well.

637
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,900
His previous organ microbleeds
caused by trauma

638
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,060
has almost recovered.

639
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,660
Have you given him tetanus antitoxin?

640
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,460
We gave him 1,500 units

641
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
on the day of surgery.

642
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,620
And then we gave him
daily intravenous antibiotics.

643
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,900
The third day after surgery,

644
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,740
the patient had abnormal pain
in his lower back,

645
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,740
and his leg movement was impaired.

646
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,900
Well,

647
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,740
Doctor.

648
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,460
What's wrong with my legs?

649
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,860
You are anxious?

650
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,340
It would be lying if I said no.

651
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,100
I am a soldier.

652
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,740
Although the war is over,

653
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,700
I still have to train regularly.

654
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,820
And to be honest,

655
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,020
the guy who was sent to the hospital
on the same day with me

656
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,300
who's having two steel nails in his leg

657
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,780
already stood up.

658
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,660
How can I not be anxious?

659
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,260
That's right.

660
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,900
I'm the one with a broken leg

661
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,860
but stood up before him.

662
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,300
Your condition is worse than his.

663
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,660
You need more time.

664
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,260
Be patient.

665
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,100
Qi Tian!

666
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,620
Qi Tian!

667
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,780
Qi Tian!

668
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,780
Qi Tian!

669
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,300
What happened, Yanqiu?

670
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,180
- What's wrong?
- Chunsheng...

671
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,100
Chunsheng...

672
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,700
What happened to him?

673
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,300
Well...

674
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,340
What happened? Say it!

675
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Chunsheng stepped on a landmine
and got wounded.

676
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,100
Wounded?

677
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,100
Is it serious?

678
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,340
I don't know.

679
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,260
He was sent to the hospital.

680
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,020
Xiaomei said that

681
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,020
he couldn't feel his legs.

682
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,780
The doctor said
they would take out the shrapnel first.

683
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,380
But they don't know
what will happen after that.

684
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,020
Qi Tian. Qi Tian.

685
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,500
I'm going to Yunnan.

686
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,780
No, wait.

687
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,980
Yanqiu, calm down first.

688
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,580
Sit down.

689
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,100
Listen to me. Sit down.

690
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,540
- Sit down.
- I'm going to Yunnan.

691
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,340
Sit down.

692
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,980
Chunsheng has had a surgery.

693
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,260
Xiaomei is there with him,

694
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,620
and Guohua, too.

695
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,660
They are there with him. He'll be fine.

696
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,740
Even if you go there,

697
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,700
you can't be of any help.

698
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,220
Right now,

699
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,260
we should just stay in Beijing
and wait for the news.

700
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,740
He will definitely go back to Beijing
for follow-up treatment.

701
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,740
We'll pick him up

702
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,540
when he comes back.

703
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,260
- Yes.
- All we can do now is

704
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,380
wait patiently.

705
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,700
I also take Chunsheng
as my younger brother.

706
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,860
I'm also worried and anxious now,

707
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,780
but that won't solve any problem.

708
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
At this time,

709
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,100
we must keep calm.

710
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,460
All right?

711
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,980
Listen to me.

712
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,260
Don't worry. It's OK.

713
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,780
It's OK.

714
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,540
It's OK.

715
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,580
Don't worry.
