=Episode 22=

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,720
My silly brother,

4
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,520
she just said that to relieve you.

5
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,760
Now, without passing an exam
or having a medical license,

6
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,400
it's nearly impossible
to work in a hospital.

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
I guess

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,320
she won't try to get a job

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
until you recover.

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Coming.

11
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,200
Xiaomei.

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,960
Yanqiu.

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,440
Come on in, come on in.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Here.

15
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,880
This is for Chunsheng.

16
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,600
He said that his lower back hurt
even more after the operation.

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,480
Let him wear this waist support.

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,440
It can keep his waist warm.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,720
You can also

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
give him a hot compress
every now and then.

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
It can relieve his pain.

22
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,800
OK.

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,440
These are things

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
Chunsheng needs to keep in mind
when training.

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
I made a list.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
If you need something else,

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
you can call me.

28
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Where are you going?

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
I have some work to do recently,

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,600
so I may not come every day.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Did your parents...

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,040
No.

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm just a little busy.

34
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,800
Yanqiu.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
It's from Xiaomei.

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,560
She knew your lower back
hurt after surgery,

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,760
so she has been trying to help.

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,280
Yanqiu, I'm much better now.

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,240
Stop lying.

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,120
Just say something nice

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,840
to Xiaomei,

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,800
OK?

43
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,320
Yanqiu,

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
I don't want to be her burden.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
Look at my legs.

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't even know
if I can stand up again.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,950
Just go step by step, be patient.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
You are hurting Xiaomei

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
by not letting her

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,400
help you at all.

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,280
Yanqiu,

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,720
it's been a while since my surgery,

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,200
but I still can't feel my legs.

54
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,920
It's all right.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
Your problem is your waist right now.

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,560
Just focus on solving this problem first.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
When your waist feels strong,

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
your legs will get strong too.

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,520
Besides,

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
you have to do your
rehabilitation training well,

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,400
not only for yourself

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
but for us too.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,800
I got it.

64
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,060
(Precautions
for Rehabilitation Exercises)

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,440
Xiaomei,

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
you insisted on leaving the army.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
That's the same as giving up

68
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,400
your chance of being a doctor.

69
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
Don't worry, Dad,

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,800
I will never give up my dream
of becoming a doctor.

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
We don't want to scold you anymore.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Xiaomei,

73
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,040
you have grown up.

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
You have your own opinions
on how to live your life now.

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,400
Your future is your own.

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
We can't accompany you

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
to the end.

78
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,080
Your dad and I

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,760
just hope you won't regret

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,800
for any choice

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
you made.

82
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Mom, don't worry.

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,480
I know you wish me all the best.

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
Some time later,

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,360
I will think of other ways

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,280
to become a good doctor.

87
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Good girl.

88
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
You have been here several times.

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I really don't mean
to make it hard for you.

90
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
You saw it too.

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Our equipment is limited.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
There are people lining up.

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
Director Wang,

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
my patient is a soldier.

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
He was wounded on the battlefield.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,040
He has sacrificed so much
for the country and the people,

97
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
could you please

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,920
allow us to come at least once a week?

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,960
All right.

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,360
OK.

101
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,560
Thanks.

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,040
Thank you.

103
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
Why did you ask me out again?

104
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,640
You take care of Chunsheng
at home every day,

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,440
I want you to relax.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,280
He's got Xiaomei anyway.

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,080
You should take a rest when you can.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,840
Besides, we should ride around

109
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,680
and see if we can find a way

110
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
to make money.

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,080
Ride around?

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
I went everywhere
and couldn't find a way.

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,280
You can't be impatient.

114
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,360
Take your time.

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
If you can't even bear this hardship,

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,640
how can you achieve
something big in the future?

117
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
What big achievement
do you want to make?

118
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,920
Listen,

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
the national rate is one to one,

120
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,320
but we can offer you a better rate.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
What is it?

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,920
Here.

123
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Let me have this.

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
Count it. Count it.

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,080
OK.

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Goodbye. Bye.

127
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,360
Bro.

128
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
You startled me!

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
What are you doing?

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,280
What are you doing?

131
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,840
Listen, I'm also a dealer.

132
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,840
I just want to ask

133
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
what kind of business you are doing.

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,480
You are a...

135
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
She is...

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
She's my girlfriend. My girlfriend.

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,920
Bro,

138
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm purchasing
foreign exchange certificates.

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,240
What are you purchasing that for?

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
You are outdated.

141
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,840
You don't know that?

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,880
Foreign exchange certificates are

143
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,440
foreign money
spent by foreigners in China.

144
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,760
Wait, I thought foreigners...

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,280
- Keep it down.
- I thought they use

146
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
US dollars and British pounds.

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
You are indeed outdated.

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
Let me explain it to you.

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,720
Foreigners have to

150
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,520
exchange their money

151
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
for foreign exchange certificates

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
to buy stuff.

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,680
Their own money won't work at all.

154
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Do you understand?

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes, I understand that.

156
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
What do you need these for?

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
Do you know the Friendship Store?

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
I know that of course.

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,920
Stuff in the Friendship Store

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
can only be bought with
foreign exchange certificates.

161
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
Everything there is good stuff.

162
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,760
They can't be bought anywhere else.

163
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
But I heard

164
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,440
only foreign guests and compatriots

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,080
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan,

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,040
could enter the Friendship Store.

167
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,920
How can you buy stuff there?

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
Dude, normally,

169
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,280
I shouldn't tell you the secrets,

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,400
but you look honest to me.

171
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't tell anyone
what I'm gonna tell you.

172
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,880
All right?

173
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,240
OK.

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,840
Our foreign exchange certificates

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
are not for shopping
at the Friendship Store.

176
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,120
It has a much better use.

177
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,080
In the south,

178
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,440
there are people purchasing foreign
exchange certificates at high prices.

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,880
Where will local businessmen
in Beijing go

180
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
after purchasing
foreign exchange certificates?

181
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,360
They go to Guangzhou

182
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,680
to buy imported cigarettes,

183
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,360
and then transport them to Beijing.

184
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,920
Their prices are more than doubled here.

185
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Really?

186
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,640
Of course.

187
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,920
Hey, dude,

188
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
sell it to me if you have some.

189
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll take however much you have.

190
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
Look, I just got these.

191
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,320
Buddy,

192
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
could you tell me

193
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,440
the exchange rate
of foreign exchange certificates

194
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,880
over RMB?

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
The national exchange rate is

196
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,840
one to one.

197
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
But at this rate,

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,160
nobody would exchange with us.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
One to one point four.

200
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
If I'm lucky,

201
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
I can get one to one point three.

202
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,280
How much do you sell it for?

203
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,680
I can't tell you two about that.

204
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
I have wasted
a lot of time with you today.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,680
I'm still busy.

206
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
Excuse me, please.

207
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
OK, thank you.

208
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,320
Thank you.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Change money.

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
Change money. Change money.

211
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,160
All right.

212
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,960
Look at this.

213
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,340
(State-run Grocery Store)

214
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,200
You chatted with that guy for so long,

215
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,520
so what is the use of this certificate?

216
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,440
You don't understand?

217
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
It's of great use.

218
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,480
It can make money?

219
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,360
Think about it.

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,840
He purchases it at a high price,

221
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,400
so he has to sell it at a higher price.

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
There must be a price difference.

223
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,080
The difference is the profit.

224
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,440
So they just purchase and then sell

225
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,720
to earn the price difference?

226
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
You've finally got it.

227
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,120
But quality stuff in Beijing
are too saleable.

228
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
We can't get any.

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
And we don't know anyone in the mall.

230
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
We can't get news

231
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,560
about new goods.

232
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,440
We can't make money this way.

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,120
Then why don't we
also go to the Friendship Store

234
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
to purchase
foreign exchange certificates?

235
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
Why should we?

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
There are so many people

237
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
purchasing it there.

238
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,560
On other people's territory,

239
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,320
there's no space for us.

240
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
Where should we go then?

241
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,960
Listen, Yanqiu,

242
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,240
tomorrow morning,

243
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
let's meet at Qianmen Coach Station.

244
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,920
Where are we going?

245
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Don't ask.

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
You'll find out tomorrow.

247
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,200
I'll take all my money with me.

248
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
OK, I won't ask.

249
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll just do what you say.

250
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
That's more like it.

251
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,020
(Unit One)

252
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,080
You are finally here.

253
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,240
I was expecting you every day.

254
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,760
I need to file a complaint with you.

255
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Some brat

256
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,040
never uses
the waist support you gave him.

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,120
And he never allows me
to give him a warm compress.

258
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,720
I told him to exercise

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,480
the way you taught him,

260
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,000
but he never does.

261
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm telling you, he just doesn't listen.

262
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,040
Yanqiu.

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,200
How could you lie? I...

264
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
Xiaomei,

265
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
I didn't...

266
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,680
Look,

267
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,960
I use the waist support
you gave me every day.

268
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,040
And Yanqiu also gave me a hot compress.

269
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
It really worked.

270
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,240
My waist is getting better now.

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,080
That's good.

272
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
Looks like you behaved
quite well this time.

273
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,800
Xiaomei,

274
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,960
thank you.

275
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,680
But Xiaomei,

276
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,640
anyhow,

277
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,320
Chunsheng's legs
are still not recovering well.

278
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,520
He still can't walk.

279
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
I came here today

280
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
just to tell you

281
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
I found a professional
rehabilitation center.

282
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,200
With the guidance
of a professional doctor,

283
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,920
he will recover faster than now.

284
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't bother.

285
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,800
I know it is hard to be accepted

286
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,360
by a rehabilitation center.

287
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,880
Xiaomei,

288
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,280
stop worrying about me.

289
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,520
I already told you

290
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
I am a professional doctor,

291
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,520
and it's my duty to take care of you.

292
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,200
Listen to the doctor and we'll be there.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,400
Listen, Yanqiu...

294
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,040
Well, Xiaomei,

295
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,120
thank you for the rehab center.

296
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,280
The key to recovery

297
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,840
depends on whether Chunsheng
cooperates with us or not.

298
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,640
I wonder if somebody

299
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,320
can bear this hardship or not.

300
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,360
Come and take a look.

301
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
Homegrown fruits!

302
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,880
Yellow peaches!

303
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,240
Take a look! Take a look!

304
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Come and take a look!

305
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Homegrown fruits!

306
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
Yellow peaches!

307
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Come and take a look.

308
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Take a look. Come on.

309
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,600
Homegrown fruits!

310
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,720
Expendable fruits!

311
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,400
It's good, huh?

312
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,640
Thank you.

313
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,960
Do you understand now?

314
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,800
After I talked to that guy,

315
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,280
I started to think.

316
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
We should purchase
foreign exchange certificates

317
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,200
at a place with many foreigners.

318
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
Why did they come to China for?

319
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
For sightseeing!

320
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
Our best attractions in Beijing

321
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,400
are the Forbidden City
and the Great Wall.

322
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
That's why

323
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,560
you took me here?

324
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,400
Look at the sides of the road,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,640
they are all farmers selling things.

326
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Foreigners buy their stuff

327
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
with foreign exchange certificates.

328
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
Let's purchase it from them.

329
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,160
Foreigners might not sell it to us.

330
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,360
Besides,

331
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,080
I don't know any foreign language.

332
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
How can I communicate with them?

333
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,320
Thank you.

334
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,520
You're welcome.

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,760
Bye-Bye.

336
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,560
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

337
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,320
Let's go ask him.

338
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,320
Let's go.

339
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,000
Sir.

340
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,640
Sir.

341
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,520
What do you want?

342
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
Do you have
foreign exchange certificates?

343
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
Look. I have a lot.

344
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,160
Are you selling it?

345
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Of course.

346
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,160
This thing

347
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,280
is useful in the city,

348
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,640
but it's useless here in the suburbs.

349
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,440
How much money do you want for it?

350
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,520
One to one point two.

351
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
One point two?

352
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,840
It's a bit high.

353
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,800
How about one point one?

354
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
You can earn ten percent

355
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,400
without doing anything. It's a good deal.

356
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,400
No way.

357
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't try to fool me.

358
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,960
You can easily sell it

359
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
at 1.3 in the town.

360
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,880
That's easy money for you.

361
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,920
You know it clearly.

362
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Young people like you from the town

363
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
come here a lot

364
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,920
for the certificates.

365
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
We know the price here.

366
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Sir, how about

367
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,680
1.15?

368
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,590
I have 800 yuan here.

369
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,310
What do you think?

370
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,310
I'll give you 805 yuan

371
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,440
for 700 certificates.

372
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
One to one point fifteen.

373
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,560
Sir, we know each other now.

374
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
I will come to you

375
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,440
every time I come here.

376
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,310
We'll be friends.

377
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,400
OK.

378
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,400
One point fifteen it is.

379
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,680
But young man,

380
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
I don't have so many certificates here.

381
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
I have to go home to get them.

382
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,480
Watch my booth here for a while.

383
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
No problem.

384
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Of course.

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,000
OK then.

386
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,800
Then come here.

387
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,680
Don't worry. We'll be here.

388
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
OK. Alright.

389
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
Apple. Apple.

390
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,920
How much is this?

391
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,240
It's apple. It's edible.

392
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
How much?

393
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,560
You can eat it with

394
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,080
or without the peel.

395
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,280
Money.

396
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,840
What were your gestures for?

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Well,

398
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,040
I don't understand them

399
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,840
and they don't understand me.

400
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
What else can I do?

401
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,480
Yanqiu.

402
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,440
I think we should

403
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
learn foreign languages in the future.

404
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,360
We didn't even go to school properly,

405
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,400
and you want to learn English?

406
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,440
You are right.

407
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
We don't need to

408
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
be experts about it,

409
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,920
but at least we should learn
how to bargain with it.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,480
That's right.

411
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,200
Seven hundred.

412
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,920
Eight hundred.

413
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,240
Sir, this is 800.

414
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
I'll give you another five yuan.

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,560
805.

416
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,440
Count it.

417
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,880
By the way,

418
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,280
sir, my name is Qi Tian.

419
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
How should I call you?

420
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,680
My surname is Ge.

421
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Just call me Ge.

422
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,840
Alright, Mr. Ge.

423
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,240
We have to go back now.

424
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,640
I'll come to you again in a few days.

425
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,880
Save your certificates up for me.

426
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
OK, if I don't have enough,

427
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,720
I'll go back to my hometown
to find some more for you.

428
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
You'll get as much as you want.

429
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
- OK, great.
- Thank you.

430
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,120
Goodbye, Mr. Ge.

431
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,520
Alright. Good.

432
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,400
Goodbye.

433
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,920
Goodbye. Goodbye.

434
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Goodbye.

435
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,160
Come here and take a look!

436
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,280
The price is reasonable!

437
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
Yellow peaches!

438
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,840
We purchased it at 1.15.

439
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,280
If we sell it to that young man

440
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,640
at 1.50, we'll earn 35 cents.

441
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,280
So it's 3.5 yuan for 10 yuan,

442
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,440
and 35 for 100, and for 7...

443
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't bother, it's 245 yuan.

444
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
This trip to the Great Wall

445
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,680
brought us 245 yuan?

446
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,720
Why is it 245?

447
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
That's wrong.

448
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
Wrong?

449
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,040
It's you who said it's 245 yuan.

450
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
That's right.

451
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
Who said I was going to
sell it that young man?

452
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Who are you going to sell it to then?

453
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,000
Let me ask you,

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,960
what does he purchase that for?

455
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
He'll sell it of course.

456
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
Yes.

457
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
So since I have
foreign exchange certificates,

458
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,040
why should I sell it to him?

459
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,560
Why don't I sell it
to the one behind him?

460
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,680
That's right.

461
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,880
Well,

462
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
where shall we find this man?

463
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,520
Who are you going to sell it to?

464
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,120
Yanqiu, let me teach you.

465
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,600
When you are doing business,

466
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,760
you need to analyze people's words.

467
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,720
I can't.

468
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
When I talked to that young man,

469
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,680
he said

470
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
those who purchase his certificates

471
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
are all businessmen.

472
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,880
These people take the certificates
to Guangdong to sell at a high price,

473
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,040
or purchase cigarettes.

474
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,040
Yes, I heard that.

475
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,360
Then what?

476
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,960
Those businessmen used to be

477
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,760
troubleshooters in Beijing.

478
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,160
I haven't been in their circle
for a long time,

479
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,840
but Heizi is still in that circle.

480
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
What are we waiting for?

481
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,360
Hurry up and go find Heizi after eating.

482
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
What did I say?

483
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
What did I say?

484
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
What are you so excited about?

485
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,960
What did you say?

486
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,000
Tian, you don't know.

487
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,560
I told them before

488
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,080
that

489
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
as long as you, my brother,

490
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,280
want to be a dealer,

491
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,840
we are going to be rich soon.

492
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,680
Was I right?

493
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,720
Is that what I said?

494
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,640
That's true.

495
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,360
That's what he said.

496
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,080
Heizi,

497
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
I admire you.

498
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
You were so right.

499
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,120
Why are you praising him?

500
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
You should praise Tian.

501
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,680
- Of course.
- Tian,

502
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,280
how did you come up with such an idea?

503
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
In just a few days,

504
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,520
you found such a good way
to make money.

505
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
And look at us.

506
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,160
We are like dummies.

507
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,400
We wasted two whole months on the streets

508
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
but didn't come up with any good ideas.

509
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,120
That's true.

510
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,960
That's right.

511
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,000
Now we don't have to
get up early and wait in line,

512
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,240
we don't have to ask others for help,

513
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,360
and we don't need to
set up a stall and yell

514
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
around it all day.

515
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
We just need to go to the Great Wall
and get the money.

516
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,680
And it's much more profitable
than what we did before,

517
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Why is Tian always so smart?

518
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
How did you come up with the idea?

519
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,120
There's nothing special.

520
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,000
It just came into my head.

521
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,610
You don't know,

522
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,680
in order to find a way
to make money, Qi Tian

523
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,000
rode his bike around Beijing.

524
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,360
Finally,

525
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
he found this chance.

526
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Yanqiu, you are not right.

527
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,600
The chance was found

528
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
because it was Tian

529
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,960
who cycled all around Beijing.

530
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,400
If it had been us,

531
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
we would find nothing

532
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,080
and would even lose our bikes.

533
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,280
Tian, I really want to know

534
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,840
how you came up with the idea

535
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,240
of purchasing the certificates
from the farmers.

536
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
One to one point fifteen.

537
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,960
That's an impossible rate

538
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,440
here in town.

539
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
The farmers are at the scenic spots,

540
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,360
foreigners buy stuff from them

541
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,160
with foreign exchange
certificates every day.

542
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,120
The money is earned easily for them.

543
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,400
So they don't really care about the rate.

544
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,520
I got it.

545
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,480
Alright, Tian,

546
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,960
we've said what we should say now.

547
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,760
Just tell us

548
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,440
what we should do.

549
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,960
That young man

550
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,160
will at most give us

551
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,160
1.4 for 1.

552
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,800
One point 4.

553
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,720
He said his clients

554
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,880
would use the foreign exchange certificates
to purchase cigarettes in the south.

555
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,800
So I thought you must know people

556
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
in this industry.

557
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,680
Even if you don't,

558
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,960
you can get information about them.

559
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,120
My plan is

560
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,000
we can sell it

561
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
to those businessmen.

562
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,800
And they will
offer a price higher than 1.4.

563
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,280
Bro,

564
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
you are so right!

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
I know a man in this industry.

566
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,040
Let me tell you,

567
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,320
I know a man

568
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,680
who is doing cigarette business

569
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,360
at Dongsi.

570
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
Every now and then,
he goes to Guangzhou.

571
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,360
He only purchases imported cigarettes.

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,040
What did I say?

573
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,280
I just knew it.

574
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,480
Yeah.

575
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,600
Tian, Heizi is good at nothing,

576
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,560
but he knows

577
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
people from

578
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,680
all walks of life.

579
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,760
Come on, Mr. Heizi

580
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,880
was a big boss

581
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,760
in the whole city.

582
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Am I right, Mr. Heizi?

583
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
Come on, Tian,

584
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,480
don't say that.

585
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,240
Do you want me to

586
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
kneel down in front of you?

587
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Why, Mr. Heizi?

588
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,280
Come on.

589
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,440
Eat some tangerine, come on.

590
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,560
Alright, that's it.

591
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,760
I will go to Dongsi
for that businessman tomorrow morning.

592
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
I think we'll get a good price.

593
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,760
Maybe it won't be very high,

594
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,840
but it's definitely higher than 1.4.

595
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,280
What's the hurry?

596
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
Business is business,

597
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
don't think too much.

598
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,760
Although he's a good friend of yours,

599
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,840
he still needs to make money.

600
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,920
I only have seven hundred,

601
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,080
it's a small amount in his eyes.

602
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,680
He doesn't care at all.

603
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,160
Seven hundred.

604
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,280
How much do you have in hand now?

605
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,760
In total, we have

606
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
about 2,200.

607
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,920
Seven hundred

608
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
plus 2,200,

609
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,280
it's almost three thousand.

610
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,080
Tomorrow, we will take the money

611
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,000
to Mr. Ge at the foot of the Great Wall.

612
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,520
Let's exchange it all into
foreign exchange certificates.

613
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,600
In this way,

614
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
it will be easier to bargain.

615
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,280
Why? Why it will be easier?

616
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,920
Let me ask you,

617
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
when you deposit money in the bank,

618
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,880
you will get more interest

619
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,240
with more capital, right?

620
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,880
Of course.

621
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
That's it!

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Can seven hundred
and three thousand be the same?

623
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,800
Understood.

624
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,760
OK.

625
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Xiaohui, give Tian all our money.

626
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Let's do something big.

627
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Tian,

628
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,840
so many years have passed,

629
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,880
and you are still

630
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,360
willing to help us

631
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,360
make money together with you

632
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,720
when you have the chance.

633
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,160
I will remember this forever.

634
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
From now on, Tian,

635
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
you are still our big brother.

636
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,560
We will do whatever
you say in the future.

637
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,120
Am I right?

638
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,680
- That's right.
- That's right.

639
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,130
(Yingbin Restaurant)

640
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
This is not lunch time yet,

641
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,040
what did you bring me here for?

642
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,480
Bro, are you hungry?

643
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,520
This is the restaurant of that
businessman I talked about.

644
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,920
This is a great area.

645
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,120
Of course.

646
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
This is their old house.

647
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,200
It's the street over his back wall,

648
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
so they knocked the wall down

649
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
and opened this restaurant.

650
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
His little brother

651
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,640
is the cook here.

652
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,600
They sell ordinary dishes

653
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
and noodles and rice.

654
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,720
This small business
makes a lot of money.

655
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,040
This is why I always say

656
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
Beijing is full of money,

657
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,240
as long as you put in the effort.

658
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,760
That's right.

659
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,120
Come on.

660
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,760
Sange!

661
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,560
Heizi, you are a rare guest.

662
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
I miss you.

663
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,600
Come on, sit down.

664
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,680
Sange,

665
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
let me introduce you.

666
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,480
This is my brother,

667
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,280
we take care of

668
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
each other.

669
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,800
His name is Qi Tian.

670
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,720
So you are the famous Tian?

671
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,720
Good to see you.

672
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,440
You know me?

673
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,360
You were a big figure.

674
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,720
Everybody knew you

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,360
in Beijing at that time.

676
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,120
How can I not know you?

677
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,360
That's all in the past.

678
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,200
Forget about it.

679
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,640
Come on.

680
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,560
Have some tea.

681
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,160
OK.

682
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,360
Alright.

683
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,000
Thank you.

684
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,800
Sange,

685
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,720
what is this tea?

686
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,120
Why does it taste a little weird?

687
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,520
You don't know.

688
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,280
Some time ago, my friend brought

689
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,720
some Tieguanyin tea from Guangzhou

690
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
for me to make kungfu tea.

691
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,040
I tried it.

692
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
It was bitter.

693
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,520
It's really not as good as

694
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,600
our Beijing jasmine tea.

695
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
Yeah, few people like this.

696
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,040
Heizi,

697
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,120
tell me,

698
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,200
what's the matter?

699
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I heard that you were
purchasing foreign exchange certificates.

700
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,680
That's right.

701
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,480
You know that

702
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
I do cigarette wholesale

703
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,480
at the Cigarette Wholesale Market
outside of Deshengmen.

704
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,080
I purchase those imported cigarettes

705
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,480
with foreign exchange certificates
in Guangzhou.

706
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,160
What is your rate here?

707
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,040
What?

708
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,440
You have some?

709
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,040
Yes.

710
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,800
Heizi,

711
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
forget it if it's just a small amount.

712
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,680
We can't bargain

713
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,280
for a little money.

714
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,960
We are better than that.

715
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,240
Yes.

716
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,040
I have this much now.

717
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,400
Three hundred?

718
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,600
Sange,

719
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,080
give it another zero.

720
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,320
Three thousand.

721
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
You've earned a lot recently.

722
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,720
That's all thanks to

723
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,200
your help.

724
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,120
I may still need your help
for something else.

725
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,160
OK.

726
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,360
Tell me

727
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
what rate

728
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,920
you want to sell your certificates at.

729
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,520
I...

730
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,560
Sange, we are just small dealers,

731
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,920
how do we have the right
to name the rate?

732
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,520
Right?

733
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,520
That's right.

734
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
Heizi is also your little brother.

735
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I believe you will
give him a reasonable rate.

736
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,080
You name it

737
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,760
and we'll accept it.

738
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,080
That's right.

739
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
You are smart.

740
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,600
What should I say?

741
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,080
I purchase

742
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,280
with all kinds of rate.

743
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,320
But today,

744
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,760
since Tian is here,

745
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,080
I must give him

746
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,960
a little gift.

747
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,720
The highest rate,

748
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,640
one point six.

749
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,560
Deal!

750
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,680
Heizi, give Sange the certificates.

751
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Three thousand.

752
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,440
Count it, please.

753
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,040
What are you talking about?

754
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,200
We are friends.

755
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How can I not trust you?

756
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
You are right.

757
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,720
Laowu,

758
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,880
come out and get the certificates.

759
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,400
We made so much money
in the past two days.

760
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,440
We'll be rich soon!

761
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,160
Cap, don't get ahead of yourself.

762
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,160
Yesterday, when Heizi and I

763
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,840
went to Mr. Ge to exchange certificates,

764
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,760
it spent him half a day

765
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,560
to get three thousand for us.

766
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,360
He said that

767
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,080
a lot of people are doing this right now.

768
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,920
It's hard for him to get thousands of it

769
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,880
in a short period of time.

770
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
Let alone them,

771
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,800
when we showed it to Sange yesterday,

772
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,960
even he was stunned a little.

773
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
He doesn't have so much money either.

774
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,400
It's alright.

775
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
We can do this

776
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,280
once a month.

777
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,440
That's right.

778
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,760
Our capital will be more and more.

779
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,120
Doing this once a month

780
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,760
is better than setting up a stall

781
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,080
every day.

782
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,280
That's right.

783
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,200
We can't think this way.

784
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,440
One way of making money
is always not enough.

785
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
We need to figure out
more ways to make money.

786
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,800
We are young and strong.

787
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,120
As long as we have ideas,

788
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,400
we must be able to make money.

789
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,120
Tian is absolutely right.

790
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,000
This time,
my brother has enlightened me.

791
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,120
We've been fooling around
in Beijing for so many years,

792
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,520
we have nothing

793
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,080
but friends all around the city.

794
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,320
And they are

795
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
all doing business now.

796
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,080
In the future,

797
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
I have to talk more with them

798
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,560
to see how they make money.

799
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,440
That's right.

800
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,560
In this society,

801
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,640
everyone is trying
their best to make money.

802
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,520
As long as we don't do illegal things,

803
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
with our own ability,

804
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
we can make a lot of money.

805
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,160
This is your share,

806
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,360
both principal and interest.

807
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
I'll take it then.

808
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,720
Just take it.

809
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,600
Should I?

810
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,080
Of course.

811
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,120
Yanqiu.

812
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,280
In the future, when anyone of us

813
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,800
has a profitable idea,

814
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,760
let's do it together

815
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,720
after discussing it.

816
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,480
What's there to discuss about?

817
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,000
We will just listen to you.

818
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,240
Well said.

819
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,040
Hongjun, what are you looking for?

820
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,760
The results will be put out at eight.

821
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,200
What are you waiting for?

822
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,760
Well,

823
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,040
Mom,

824
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,440
where did you put that pair of gold rings

825
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
my grandma left me?

826
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,920
You want to propose to Ye Fang?

827
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,360
Mom,

828
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,560
a good life is waiting for us.

829
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,440
Which school do Liu Zhen, Tian Guoqing

830
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,560
and Chen Hongjun belong to?

831
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,440
They are unbelievable.

832
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,840
(Chen Hongjun Scored 90 Rank 3)
They actually got 90 points!

833
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
You are right.

834
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,230
Yes.

835
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,440
They are amazing.

836
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,760
Mom!

837
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,150
Mom!

838
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,320
I passed the interview!

839
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,280
I passed it!

840
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
I got third place!

841
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,670
Really?

842
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,800
Hongjun! Hongjun!

843
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,880
Hongjun!

844
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,440
Hongjun!

845
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,120
Hongjun! Where are you going?

846
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,720
My son passed the interview!

847
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,880
My son passed it!

848
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,560
My son passed it!

849
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
He passed it! He passed it!

850
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,720
He passed it?

851
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,360
This noon.

852
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,720
This noon,

853
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,960
let's have lunch together!

854
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,600
- Let's celebrate.
- Yes!

855
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,680
Yes, that's right.

856
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,360
OK. OK.

857
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,400
OK, good.

858
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,000
This is great.

859
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Do you need help?

860
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,320
No need. No need.

861
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,160
Mom,

862
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,240
Hongjun is not right for that job.

863
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Mom,

864
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,520
this is not prejudice.

865
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,640
I am telling the truth.

866
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,680
Yes,

867
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,560
he has good learning,

868
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,000
language and organizational skills.

869
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,080
But I think,

870
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,040
to judge a person,

871
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,520
you should not just
look at his strengths,

872
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,760
but also his weaknesses.

873
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,840
He is bold,

874
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,920
and likes to show off.

875
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
When something goes wrong,
he tends to escape.

876
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,400
There are many temptations
at the customs.

877
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm afraid he won't be able
to stand the temptation.

878
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,320
In fact, I think Hongjun

879
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,120
is most suitable for

880
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,720
staying in college for research.

881
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
May be out of vanity,

882
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,760
he just wants to enter politics.

883
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,240
Even if he has to do that,

884
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
I think that

885
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,560
he'd better enter a government agency

886
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,520
and do some down-to-earth job.

887
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,360
Mom, please hold on.

888
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
Hello, Mom.

889
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,120
Nothing, let's continue.

890
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,440
This is a great event in our yard!

891
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,080
Right.

892
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
This is truly a great event!

893
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
You must drink some liquor today.

894
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,800
You must drink some.

895
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm so happy.

896
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,760
Everybody is happy here.

897
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,720
This is such a great event.

898
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,320
You two should drink some liquor later.

899
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,960
Yes,

900
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
we will.

901
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,200
We are all so happy.

902
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,800
He's back.

903
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,280
Hongjun, you are back.

904
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,760
Look,

905
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,520
what a great kid.

906
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,080
That's right.

907
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,920
If my son were like Hongjun,

908
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I would be so happy.

909
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,400
That's right.

910
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,240
When Hongjun was
admitted to college that year,

911
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
I told my husband that

912
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,040
Hongjun would definitely
achieve something in the future.

913
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,960
Are you envious?

914
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
If you are,

915
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,600
let your grandson

916
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,840
go to college too.

917
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,000
That's right.

918
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,400
Aunt, well,

919
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,480
where is my mother?

920
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,520
Your mom is in the kitchen.

921
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:54,960
Go ahead.

922
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
- Your mother is waiting for you.
- Go ahead.

923
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,080
Go to talk to your mother.

924
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,960
Come on.

925
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,720
Look at this kid.

926
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,800
Come on, sit down.

927
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,960
Come on.

928
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,880
Hongjun, how was it going?

929
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,960
Did Ye Fang say yes?

930
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,720
It's natural for girls to be reserved.

931
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Come on, harder.

932
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,120
Step on my hand harder.

933
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,360
Good.

934
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,640
Very good. Come on.

935
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,680
Left leg.

936
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,200
OK, right leg.

937
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,480
Alright. Your feet.

938
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,120
Good. Go on.

939
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,200
Hang in there.

940
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,360
Continue.

941
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,400
Good.

942
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,760
Hang on.

943
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,320
Good. Good.

944
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,360
Doctor,

945
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,000
I've been here for more than 20 days,

946
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,080
but why can't I still

947
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,920
feel my right leg?

948
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
It might have something to do

949
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,680
with where you were shot.

950
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,200
Do not worry.

951
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,200
Your left leg

952
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,280
is almost recovered, right?

953
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,480
Just keep practicing

954
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,120
and there shouldn't be a big problem.

955
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,520
OK. Good.

956
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,200
Alright. Hang in there.

957
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,080
Good. Hang in there.

958
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,800
Good.

959
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:58,960
Come on.

960
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,760
Xiao Chunsheng's family.

961
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,480
Come on.

962
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,400
I'll make an appointment
for your next treatment.

963
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,560
You have a good girlfriend.

964
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,840
I have told you many times that

965
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
we are just friends.

966
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,160
Anyway,

967
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,120
look at me,

968
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,240
I don't want to be her burden.

969
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,040
Just treat her nicely.

970
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,240
She is a good girl.

971
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,760
Let me tell you,

972
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,600
in our rehab center...

973
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,080
Come on.

974
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,640
Again.

975
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,800
The rehabilitation equipment here

976
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,080
were introduced recently.

977
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,360
We are one of the best
rehab centers in Beijing.

978
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,120
It's scarce resources.

979
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,200
You can ask around.

980
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
There are people lining up for it.

981
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,080
If your girlfriend hadn't come

982
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,120
to this place many times,

983
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,640
and asked your troops to send a letter
explaining the situation,

984
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,440
we wouldn't have made you an exception

985
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,240
and let you come here every week.

986
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,600
That's why... Come on.

987
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,560
Harder.

988
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
You can never

989
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,160
let her down

990
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,400
just for what she did.

991
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,600
Come on.

992
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,360
OK. Again.

993
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,440
Relax. Good.

994
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,240
The golden recovery period after surgery

995
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,920
is about one month

996
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,080
from the beginning of rehabilitation.

997
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,800
If at this time,

998
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,760
he can feel his right leg,

999
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,440
and can restore
part of his athletic ability,

1000
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,680
there is still
the possibility of full recovery.

1001
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,040
On the contrary,

1002
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,320
if there is no obvious improvement

1003
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,920
this month,

1004
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,720
I suggest that

1005
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,440
he should be ready
to accept the worst result.

1006
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,320
You have been here
for more than twenty days,

1007
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,840
how do you feel now?

1008
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,240
My left leg is okay.

1009
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,400
I can move it a little,

1010
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,200
but I just can't

1011
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,400
feel my right leg.

1012
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Pinch it with your hand,

1013
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,640
and see if it hurts.

1014
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
No. I don't feel it at all.

1015
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,080
Then

1016
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,120
try lifting it and see what happens.

1017
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,240
It can't move.

1018
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,080
Oh, no. You are the same as me.

1019
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,240
It's hopeless.

1020
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,520
We don't have
good enough equipment here.

1021
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,040
There are just horizontal bars,

1022
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,360
parallel bars

1023
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,520
and some orthoterions.

1024
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,160
These things

1025
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,600
can cure traumatic injuries,

1026
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,040
but for us

1027
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,760
whose nerves are damaged,

1028
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,680
they are useless.

1029
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,280
I heard that

1030
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,400
some foreigners invented an instrument

1031
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,160
which can flash some light

1032
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,080
in your injured parts,

1033
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,240
and make your nerves,

1034
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,280
