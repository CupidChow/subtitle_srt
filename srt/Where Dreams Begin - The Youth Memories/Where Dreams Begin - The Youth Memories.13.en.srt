00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,220
Hongling.

5
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,700
What?

6
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,540
(Rehearsal Room)
Someone asked to see you.

7
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,740
Who?

8
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,300
There he is.

9
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,060
(Keep Practicing)

10
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,460
Chunsheng.

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,300
(While in the army,)

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,020
(Xiao Chunsheng and He Hongling)

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,660
(controlled their feelings for each other.)

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,260
(They strictly observed discipline,)

15
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,380
(and saw each other as friends
and comrades-in-arms.)

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,900
Hongling,

17
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,940
why don't you speak?

18
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,220
Do not move.

19
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,620
Stay there.

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,380
Let me take a good look at you.

21
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,860
You are stronger and tan.

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,500
You are

23
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
like a real soldier now.

24
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,980
You look cool.

25
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,740
Hongling,

26
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,740
you are more beautiful than before.

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,220
Shut up.

28
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,500
Let me ask you.

29
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,260
You have been in Yunnan for so long,

30
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,220
why didn't you come see me earlier?

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,300
I'd have come if I had been able to.

32
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,980
But you also know that

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
a recruit company has its discipline.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,060
Alright.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,620
I was also in the recruit company.

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,060
Hongling,

37
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
the three-month training for recruits

38
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,380
is basically over.

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
Guohua gave us two days off.

40
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,100
And then we'll go to our new troops.

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,260
Congratulations.

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
You can finally become a real soldier.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,940
All right, enough about me.

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,900
Tell me about you.

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,740
How have you been?

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,260
I've been fine.

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,210
Since the overthrow of the Gang of Four,

48
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,900
our orchestra has resumed performances

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,940
of some classical music
and world famous pieces.

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,500
So I've been busy rehearsing all day.

51
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,620
Am I disturbing you?

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,180
Actually, we are rehearsing right now.

53
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,500
Hongling, how about this?

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,580
You go on with your rehearsal now.

55
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,420
I won't leave tonight anyway.

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,820
I'll stay at the military hostel.

57
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,980
I'll pick you up after your rehearsal.

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,180
And let's have dinner at the best restaurant
in Kunming tonight.

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,260
OK.

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,860
Our rehearsal is almost over.

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,700
Wait for me.

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Okay, go ahead.

63
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,140
Alright.

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,300
Hongling.

65
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,500
I have seen it all.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,140
What?

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,940
Was that your boyfriend just now?

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,620
No, not at all.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,580
Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

70
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,220
He is handsome.

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,740
Tell me about it.

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,380
Are you dating?

73
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
He's just my friend.

74
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,940
He just joined the army this year,

75
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
so I'm trying to help him as a friend.

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,380
Let's practice.

77
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,740
Please don't get me wrong.

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,900
I just think that

79
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,900
it would be nice if he were your boyfriend.

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm actually yearning for love.

81
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,660
He's really not.

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,660
Just cut it out.

83
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,300
OK, OK, sorry about that.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,860
Hongling, let me tell you,

85
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,980
they make the most authentic
steam pot chicken here.

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,820
I heard it has a history
of more than 100 years.

87
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,460
It's especially famous in Kunming.

88
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,420
Come on.

89
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,660
Try it. Be careful, it's hot.

90
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,220
Be careful.

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,100
What do you think?

92
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,220
It's so delicious.

93
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,580
I'm glad that you like it.

94
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,580
I'll give you some more.

95
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,660
Mr. Xiang,

96
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,180
I have told you everything.

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,500
It's time for you to say something.

98
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,740
Listen, Tao,

99
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,820
I put

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,220
all my money and even my life

101
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,580
on this rock.

102
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,900
You can't just take it

103
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,940
like this.

104
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,700
Listen,

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,420
in Kunming,

106
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,700
whatever I say is the rule.

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,180
Moreover,

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,380
I'm not just taking it.

109
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
I know that you bought it

110
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
with 5,000 yuan.

111
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,620
I'll double it for you.

112
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,740
It's a great deal for you.

113
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,780
10,000?

114
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,100
Tao,

115
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,020
you are right,

116
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,140
I bought this raw jadeite jade

117
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,180
with 5,000.

118
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,820
But after I opened it up,

119
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,740
I found that it's perfect.

120
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,580
It is perfect

121
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,500
at all aspects.

122
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,420
Let's forget about

123
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,180
how much I can sell this for,

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,140
after I opened it up in Tengchong,

125
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,860
someone offered me over 100,000,

126
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,700
but I didn't sell it.

127
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,620
And now you are offering 10,000.

128
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,940
This is robbery.

129
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,180
Mr. Xiang,

130
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,820
calm down, please.

131
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,220
It took you all day to travel to Kunming

132
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,660
from Tengchong, you must be hungry.

133
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,220
Let's talk over food, shall we?

134
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,980
Let's eat.

135
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,620
I'll fill your cup up.

136
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,180
Come on.

137
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,500
Let me do it.

138
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,660
Chunsheng,

139
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,700
you have told me these

140
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,260
in your letters, don't you remember?

141
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,740
Why are you repeating them now?

142
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,140
Really? I have told you?

143
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,660
OK.

144
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
Wait a minute.

145
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
I'll see if I have something new to say.

146
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,780
Come on.

147
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,540
Just eat.

148
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,220
I have to go back after eating.

149
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,020
If I go back late,

150
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
I'll be criticized by Mrs. Huang.

151
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,220
Take good care of yourself.

152
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,500
Xiao Chunsheng?

153
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Duan Lei.

154
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,420
Why are you here?

155
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,620
We got two days off,

156
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,900
so I came here to visit a friend.

157
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,020
He's my comrade-in-arms.

158
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,900
Maybe you can go first.

159
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,500
OK.

160
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,500
Remember

161
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,260
to offer incense to Master for me.

162
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,860
Consider it down.

163
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,460
Take your time.

164
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,660
Chunsheng,

165
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,500
who is this lady?

166
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,740
Aren't you going to introduce us?

167
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,460
Hongling,

169
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,180
this is Duan Lei, my comrade-in-arms.

170
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,220
He is a local.

171
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,860
Duan Lei, this is He Hongling, my friend.

172
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,940
She is a violinist
at the Military Art Troupe.

173
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,300
Nice to meet you.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Nice to meet you, too.

175
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,500
The letters written
by Chunsheng late at night

176
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,700
must be for you, I guess.

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,220
Maybe.

178
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,740
Maybe?

179
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,940
Of course they're for you.

180
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,860
Come on, sit down.

181
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,900
Please.

182
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,220
Hello, we need some tableware here.

183
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,260
Mr. Xiang,

184
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,460
you have had my food

185
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,180
and my drink.

186
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,700
Tell me what you are thinking now.

187
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,660
Tao,

188
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,420
I know that

189
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,140
you and your elder brother

190
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,420
have great power in Kunming.

191
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,780
I, Xiang Nan, can't afford to offend you.

192
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,340
But I have been
betting on rocks for so long,

193
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,780
this is all I have now.

194
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,420
I finally got something good.

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,140
My whole family

196
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,260
is counting on this rock to make a fortune.

197
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,300
I...

198
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,780
I really can't give it to you.

199
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,060
You idiot!

200
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,020
You are stubborn, huh?

201
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,580
Nobody has dared to say no

202
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,900
to our boss here.

203
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,780
Are you tired of living?

204
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,260
Don't try to scare me!

205
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,580
I, Xiang Nan,
have gone through everything!

206
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,680
No,

207
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,340
Tao,

208
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,660
don't get me wrong.

209
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,020
It's not that I have to turn you down.

210
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,980
I have made it very clear.

211
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,820
I can't

212
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,500
give you this rock

213
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,660
even if you kill me!

214
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,900
Mr. Xiang.

215
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Calm down, OK?

216
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,140
Calm down.

217
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,660
We are still friends
even if we can't make a deal.

218
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,340
We are old acquaintances

219
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,940
in this industry.

220
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
I'm not gonna force you to sell it to me.

221
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,300
Boss.

222
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,580
Tao.

223
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,260
Well...

224
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,500
You mean...

225
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,180
That's it?

226
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,660
That's it.

227
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,260
I can go now?

228
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
You are free to go.

229
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,220
Tao,

230
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,660
thank you for letting me go.

231
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
I... I...

232
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,620
This meal is on me!

233
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,060
Please enjoy, guys.

234
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,740
Please enjoy, and excuse me.

235
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
No need to see me out.

236
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,660
Goodbye.

237
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,780
Boss,

238
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,900
you are letting him go like that?

239
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,180
Yeah, Boss.

240
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,700
After our brothers in Tengchong

241
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
sent us the message,

242
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,100
we waited for a long time

243
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,900
for Xiang Nan at the bus station.

244
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,300
We finally got him,

245
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,060
but you just let him go?

246
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
Yes, Tao,

247
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,060
according to our brothers in Tengchong,

248
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,540
if we sell that rock properly,

249
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
we'll at least get a million.

250
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,500
Yes.

251
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,460
If we get this down,

252
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,220
the money will be enough

253
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,580
for the rest of our lives.

254
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,900
It's such a good opportunity.

255
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
How can you let it go?

256
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,060
Let go?

257
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,940
How is that possible?

258
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,700
Since he is courting death,

259
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,220
let's help him.

260
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,820
Xiaoqi, hurry back and call our people up.

261
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,900
Make sure to kill him
before he gets home.

262
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,860
Consider it done!

263
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,580
Let's follow him.

264
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:20,980
Let's go.

265
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,220
The weather in Kunming is so nice.

266
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,180
Yes.

267
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,900
It's winter in Beijing.

268
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,500
Sometimes I really miss Beijing.

269
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,500
At this time,

270
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
we could go skating in Shichahai.

271
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,180
Duan Lei,

272
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,180
you don't know yet,

273
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,940
but Hongling and I met on the ice rink.

274
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,220
Really?

275
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,260
You guys from Beijing always say that

276
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,900
Beijing's winter is so beautiful.

277
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,260
There are snow

278
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,540
and you can go skating at the ice rink.

279
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,060
That's right.

280
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
I am a native of Yunnan.

281
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,540
We have neither winter

282
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,500
nor ice here.

283
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,020
Is skating fun?

284
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,260
Of course it's fun.

285
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,260
You can't imagine.

286
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
How should I describe
the feeling of skating?

287
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,900
It's like flying.

288
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,220
Listen,

289
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,380
when you come to Beijing,

290
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,180
I'll teach you to skate.

291
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,260
That's great.

292
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,780
OK, that's a deal.

293
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,260
Where are you going?

294
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,460
What do you want?

295
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,700
Xiang Nan,

296
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,780
we gave you a chance to live,

297
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
but you had to court death.

298
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
You wanna die, huh?

299
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,020
I'll help you with it.

300
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,140
Get him!

301
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
- Stop!
- Don't run!

302
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,820
- Stop!
- Come back!

303
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,900
Help!

304
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,100
Help!

305
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,740
Help!

306
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,420
Help!

307
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,540
- Help!
- Stop there!

308
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,900
Comrades, help!

309
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,220
- Stop!
- Come back!

310
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
Comrades, save me!

311
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,260
What's going on?

312
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,100
They're... They're trying to kill me!

313
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,140
What are you doing?

314
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,660
They are soldiers, what should we do?

315
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,580
Yeah, Boss.

316
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
We can't afford
to mess with the soldiers.

317
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,020
Maybe we should leave.

318
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,340
No way!

319
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,660
Xiang Nan knows
that we're trying to kill him.

320
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,060
If he tells the police

321
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,660
and then sues us for attempted murder,

322
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,620
we'll all be doomed!

323
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,860
But they are...

324
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,100
There's no but.

325
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
These three soldiers

326
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,780
don't know who we are at all.

327
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,540
As long as we kill Xiang Nan

328
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,540
and take his stuff,

329
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,660
no one knows who did it.

330
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,900
But Boss,

331
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,220
what if those soldiers

332
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,140
stop us from doing that?

333
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,660
Boys, we have no choice.

334
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,860
Let's do it!

335
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,580
You guys,

336
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,980
put down your weapons

337
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,500
and turn yourselves in now.

338
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,900
This is your only way out.

339
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,060
Hongling, take this person and leave now.

340
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,100
Go to the police station to call for help.

341
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,900
What about you?

342
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,300
These people are obviously desperadoes.

343
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,540
They are trying to kill him.

344
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,220
Duan Lei and I will hold them up.

345
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,860
Go now.

346
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,660
No, I won't.

347
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,260
How can a soldier flee in battle?

348
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,260
Comrade, go to the police now.

349
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,980
We'll hold them up for you.

350
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,020
OK.

351
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,810
I...

352
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,300
Stop!

353
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
Do it!

354
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,500
Attack!

355
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,460
Hongling!

356
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,260
Chunsheng.

357
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,100
Be careful!

358
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,900
Hongling!

359
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,820
Chunsheng!

360
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,500
Chunsheng, are you okay?

361
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,540
I'm fine.

362
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,100
Hongling, your hand.

363
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,580
I'm fine.

364
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,860
Duan Lei!

365
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,100
Boss, are you okay?

366
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,900
Kill him!

367
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,780
Boss, you are bleeding.

368
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,780
Go get Xiang Nan!

369
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,540
Stop!

370
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,860
Come here!

371
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,300
You really want to die, right?

372
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Bring it on!

373
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,740
The police are here!

374
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,540
Run, run, Boss!

375
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,780
Boss, let's go!

376
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Freeze! Stop! Don't run!

377
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,620
Don't move!

378
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,100
Stop there!

379
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't move!

380
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Stop there!

381
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
Boss, run!

382
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,700
Stop!

383
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't run anymore.

384
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,540
Get back here!

385
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,140
Boss!

386
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,140
Chunsheng.

387
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,380
(Nurse Station)

388
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,940
You're awake.

389
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,420
What's wrong with me?

390
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,940
You lost a lot of blood last night,

391
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,940
and were taken to the hospital.

392
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,300
Oh, Miss.

393
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,460
How is that

394
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,060
female soldier named He Hongling?

395
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,060
She's fine.

396
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,820
Just got a few cuts.

397
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,940
She just got her infusion,

398
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,060
and is now sleeping in the next ward.

399
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,260
Come on.

400
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,140
Thank goodness she's fine.

401
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
Thank goodness.

402
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,940
The police came this morning,

403
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,180
but they didn't wake you up.

404
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,220
Now,

405
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,060
they are talking to your comrade-in-arms

406
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,260
named Duan Lei.

407
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,540
By the way, how is he?

408
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,820
His condition is pretty bad.

409
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,300
He has a broken rib

410
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,700
and a few cuts.

411
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,700
But they are all taken care of.

412
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,500
I guess it will take him days to recover.

413
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,660
Be careful.

414
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,820
I'm fine.

415
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,300
Don't.

416
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,740
Let her sleep.

417
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,180
Sit down.

418
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,540
Miss,

419
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,300
you can go back to your work.

420
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,780
I want to stay here with her for a while.

421
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,940
OK.

422
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,140
Thank you.

423
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,900
Thanks.

424
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,900
Hongling, you're awake.

425
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,900
Chunsheng.

426
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,700
Be careful.

427
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Hongling, how are you?

428
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm fine.

429
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,660
Tell me,

430
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,820
why didn't you

431
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,540
leave last night?

432
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,820
What a stupid question.

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,780
Ask another one.

434
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,980
I really didn't expect that

435
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,860
you would fight a gangster with a dagger

436
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,580
without hesitation.

437
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,500
Of course I would.

438
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,900
I couldn't watch him
kill my beloved one, could I?

439
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,140
Does it hurt?

440
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,940
Hongling,

441
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,780
thank you.

442
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,740
Chunsheng,

443
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,980
to protect me,

444
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
your head was hit badly,

445
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,460
and throughout the whole fight,

446
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,540
you protected me with your body.

447
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,540
I'm the one

448
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
who should say thank you.

449
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,180
Hongling,

450
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,140
after last night,

451
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,140
I really feel that

452
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,940
the two of us can never be apart again.

453
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,780
Chunsheng,

454
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,260
I hope you can protect me like this

455
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,020
for the rest of my life.

456
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,820
I will.

457
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,100
Chunsheng,

458
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,460
I know you're in a bad mood,

459
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,940
but in that situation,

460
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,620
if you hadn't fought back,

461
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,100
the one lying on the ground
would have been you.

462
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,380
Guohua.

463
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,100
Hi, Guohua.

464
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,900
Xiao Chunsheng!

465
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,180
How could you let Hongling get hurt?

466
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Ye Guohua,

467
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,860
you don't know what happened at all.

468
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,500
If it were you,

469
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
Hongling would be hurt even worse.

470
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,180
Believe it or not.

471
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Nonsense, if I had been there,

472
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,860
Hongling would be safe and sound.

473
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,140
Does it hurt, Hongling?

474
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,500
Stop it. Don't touch her.

475
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,300
Go sit there.

476
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,860
Come on.

477
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,860
Why do you guys quarrel
every time you meet each other?

478
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,100
I don't want to quarrel with him.

479
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,420
I'm just mad at him

480
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,180
for not protecting you well.

481
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,420
He let you get hurt.

482
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,140
How useless.

483
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,340
Don't say that, Guohua.

484
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,500
There were a dozen of armed gangsters,

485
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
I would have died if it hadn't been

486
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,860
for Chunsheng's protection.

487
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,780
Stop saying that!

488
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,420
It's ominous, don't say that.

489
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,060
It's true.

490
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,220
You don't know
how dire the situation was.

491
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,860
The businessman surnamed Xiang

492
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,020
would have been killed
if we hadn't been there.

493
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,940
I've basically heard

494
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,620
all of your heroic deeds.

495
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,780
I just have one question.

496
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,620
Xiao Chunsheng, what were you thinking?

497
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,100
Why didn't you
ask Hongling to leave first?

498
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,220
It's fine if you wanted to be a hero,

499
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,460
why did you have to put Hongling

500
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,940
in such a dangerous situation?

501
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,540
Do you hear that, Hongling?

502
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,900
What did I say?

503
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,580
I knew he would

504
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,940
complain about this.

505
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,180
Guohua,
you can't blame Chunsheng for that.

506
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,700
He firmly asked me to go to the police,

507
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,980
but I insisted on not going.

508
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,380
I believe that if it were you,

509
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,580
or any of our friends,

510
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
nobody would leave.

511
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,420
Not to mention I'm a soldier.

512
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,180
Hey,

513
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,180
how bad is it?

514
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,620
Although those hooligans hurt my body,

515
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,140
they couldn't hurt my strong will.

516
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,540
But that punch from my brother just now

517
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,940
broke my heart.

518
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Cut it out!

519
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,100
You are still joking,

520
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,220
that means you are fine.

521
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,980
What about Duan Lei?

522
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,060
I heard he was with you too

523
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,020
during that bloody battle.

524
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,220
Facing more than a dozen gangsters,
he didn't take half a step back.

525
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,940
What a man!

526
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,020
Where is he? Is he badly hurt?

527
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,060
Don't worry.

528
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,540
His situation is just like mine.

529
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,180
He is now under investigation
by the Public Security Bureau.

530
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm glad he's not seriously injured,

531
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,940
otherwise, as his platoon leader,

532
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,860
I wouldn't know
how to explain to his family.

533
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,180
You all know that

534
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,540
Duan Lei is a local soldier from Yunnan.

535
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,140
At the beginning,

536
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,060
I really disliked him.

537
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,620
In the recruit company,

538
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,100
he had to compete with me

539
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,980
and beat me in everything.

540
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,540
I really hated him.

541
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,700
But after fighting

542
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,740
side by side with him

543
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,620
last night on the streets of Kunming,

544
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,140
I deeply understand

545
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,100
what is a comrade-in-arms.

546
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,140
From today on,

547
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
he and I are brothers.

548
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,860
And me, Chunsheng.

549
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,820
Although it was not on the battlefield,

550
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,740
but on the midnight streets of Kunming,

551
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,460
the three of us
became real comrades-in-arms.

552
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,740
I, He Hongling, will never forget it.

553
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,540
Me too.

554
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,260
That's great, comrades-in-arms.

555
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,060
What a sacred word.

556
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,220
It's such a pity...

557
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,580
What pity?

558
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,220
It's a pity that I was not there.

559
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,860
That's my loss.

560
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,380
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

561
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,020
we've figured out the whole situation.

562
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,420
Firstly,

563
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,860
on behalf of
Kunming Public Security Bureau,

564
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,700
we express gratitude to you.

565
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,740
We hope you can recover

566
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,900
and return to the army soon.

567
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,340
Thank you, officers.

568
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,260
Also,

569
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,260
on behalf of
Kunming Public Security Bureau,

570
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,340
we express

571
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,140
deep respect and praise to you,

572
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,620
Comrade Duan Lei and Comrade He Hongling

573
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,460
for your heroic deeds.

574
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,260
Our bureau has told your units

575
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,740
about what happened.

576
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,980
You, Duan Lei and He Hongling

577
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,140
will get credit for what you did.

578
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,300
Thank you.

579
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,900
As a soldier
of the People's Liberation Army,

580
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,380
when the people's safety and property

581
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,900
are seriously threatened,

582
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,060
of course I should come forward

583
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,700
to fulfill the responsibilities
and obligations of a soldier.

584
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,580
Well said!

585
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,060
By the way, Officer, I want to ask

586
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,300
about the head of the gangsters yesterday.

587
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,060
That head of the gangster was Jia Tao.

588
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,420
He often gathered

589
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,020
some idle people

590
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,060
to do something endangering the citizens.

591
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,140
He was an unscrupulous bully

592
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,340
with a gangster background.

593
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,540
We have been

594
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,340
paying attention to his movements.

595
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,820
This time he was trying to rob

596
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,020
a Kunming businessman named Xiang Nan

597
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,340
of his piece of jadeite from Tengchong.

598
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,300
So he tried to murder for money.

599
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,900
He is really diabolical.

600
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,620
Then... Is he... Is he dead?

601
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,500
He died on the spot.

602
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,580
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

603
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,340
don't worry about it.

604
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
After our investigation,

605
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,300
we have confirmed that

606
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,780
it was Jia Tao who attacked you first.

607
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,620
In that critical moment,

608
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,700
you subconsciously resisted.

609
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,380
That's justifiable defense.

610
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,100
Jia Tao's death
has nothing to do with you.

611
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,540
You don't have to
bear any legal responsibility.

612
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,780
Do not worry.

613
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,820
Chunsheng,

614
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
how did they determine the nature?

615
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,700
Justifiable defense.

616
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,580
It's 100% justifiable defense.

617
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,220
Let me tell you,

618
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,780
that gangster surnamed Jia

619
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,140
deserved to die.

620
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,220
Chunsheng,

621
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,460
you just did
what you were supposed to do.

622
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,140
Don't be mentally burdened.

623
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,980
Chunsheng,

624
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
you have to cheer up.

625
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,140
I understand what you're saying,

626
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,900
but after all that was...

627
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,260
Hongling, don't worry,

628
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,300
I will be fine.

629
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,180
By the way, Chunsheng,

630
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,060
when you were not here just now,

631
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,060
Platoon Leader Ye and Hongling

632
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,220
told me everything

633
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,300
you said to them.

634
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,460
That made me

635
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,780
full of motion.

636
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,700
That's also what I thought.

637
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,340
From today on,

638
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,180
the two of us are brothers.

639
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,220
Comrades-in-arms for life!

640
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,380
Brothers for life.

641
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,860
By the way, Lei,

642
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,820
the Vice Captain of the
Public Security Bureau's Criminal Police Unit,

643
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,180
his name is Zhan Jun, right?

644
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,100
Why did I feel that this person

645
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,300
was so familiar?

646
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Look at you.

647
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,900
You forgot just overnight.

648
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,580
He was the one who had dinner with me

649
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,060
at Fuzhao Restaurant last night.

650
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,860
Oh, that's right.

651
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
The two of us

652
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,700
are both Tengchong locals.

653
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,900
My dad was his master.

654
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,180
I came back this time

655
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,460
especially to visit him.

656
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
I heard that last night,

657
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,060
a few gangsters ran away?

658
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
A man nicknamed Melon escaped,

659
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,100
but the police are conducting
a city-wide manhunt.

660
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,900
What about that jeweler named Xiang Nan?

661
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,100
I think he has gone home

662
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,580
after receiving the investigation.

663
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,580
By the way, Lei,

664
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
I want to ask you something.

665
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,700
Go on.

666
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,860
Jia Tao and his gang

667
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,180
hunted Xiang Nan down

668
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,860
just for a rock?

669
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,860
A rock?

670
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,460
That's no ordinary rock.

671
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
That's a jadeite.

672
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,140
I heard about that before.

673
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
They say it's valuable.

674
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,780
Of course it's valuable.

675
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,020
I asked them about

676
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,580
that jadeite with Xiang Nan.

677
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,980
Do you know

678
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,900
how much it's worth?

679
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,140
How much?

680
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,220
One million at least.

681
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,860
One million?

682
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,740
Just that rock?

683
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,660
It's no wonder that Jia Tao and his gang

684
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,420
tried to kill a man for it.

685
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,380
Yes.

686
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Zhan Jun told me that

687
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,820
the moment Xiang Nan

688
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,100
got this jadeite in Tengchong,

689
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,580
someone present

690
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,220
reported it to Jia Tao.

691
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
So Jia Tao

692
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,380
caught Xiang Nan in Kunming

693
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,900
and tried to buy it from him
with 10,000 yuan.

694
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,380
Of course Xiang Nan didn't agree.

695
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,300
They didn't make the deal.

696
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,340
That's why Jia Tao tried to kill him.

697
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,580
They tried to kill someone for money.

698
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,100
That's terrible.

699
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,620
And Zhan Jun told me that

700
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,980
Jia Tao

701
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,540
has a big brother named Jia Hui.

702
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,380
Jia Hui is the head of a very large

703
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,300
underworld organization in Yunnan.

704
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,740
He's extremely vigilant.

705
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,660
The police tried many times to arrest him,

706
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,660
but he managed to get away
and hide abroad every time.

707
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,620
This time his younger brother Jia Tao

708
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,220
died because of us,

709
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,540
I guess Jia Hui

710
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,140
won't let us go easily.

711
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
Zhan Jun wants us

712
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,540
to be more careful.

713
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,820
In addition,

714
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,940
he also sent the police

715
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,660
to secretly protect
Xiang Nan and his family.

716
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,420
If Jia Hui

717
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,900
takes any retaliatory action,

718
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
they will arrest him.

719
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,740
Something will come
if it's doomed to come.

720
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,220
Evil will never prevail.

721
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,140
Whatever. I'm not afraid of him.

722
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,740
Boss!

723
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,860
Boss, please stop.

724
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:11,980
Boss.

725
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,660
Spare me, please.

726
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,260
What is the name of the soldier
that killed my brother?

727
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,140
Boss,

728
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,020
it happened so suddenly,

729
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,620
and there were many policemen chasing us.

730
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,980
I... I only focused on running.

731
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,620
I really don't know his name, Boss.

732
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,060
Send people to Kunming immediately

733
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,060
to investigate it.

734
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,460
Yes.

735
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,460
Guan,

736
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,420
send someone reliable

737
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,020
to collect my brother's body.

738
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,940
Boss,

739
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,460
would you like to see his face
for the last time?

740
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,300
Forget it.

741
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,180
Bury him directly

742
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,500
to our ancestral grave.

743
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,300
Got it.

744
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,300
Doctor,

745
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,900
Xiao Chunsheng and Duan Lei
are my soldiers.

746
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,300
Will their injuries affect their future?

747
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,500
They are both

748
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,780
recovering well now.

749
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,180
They can be discharged from the hospital

750
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,940
after an rest-cure.

751
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,860
Their wounds

752
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,780
will never affect them

753
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,140
to be qualified soldiers.

754
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,420
That's good.

755
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,740
Thank you.

756
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,740
Boss,

757
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,940
Tao has been buried.

758
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,500
Boss, I've figured it out.

759
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,540
That soldier's name is Xiao Chunsheng.

760
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
He grew up in a military compound
in Beijing

761
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,300
and became a soldier not long ago.

762
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,780
Xiao Chunsheng.

763
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,540
Where is he now?

764
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,380
He's in the hospital.

765
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,140
He and his friend named Duan Lei

766
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,820
were all wounded by Tao.

767
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,060
They are now in the military hospital
of Kunming Military Region.

768
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,780
I heard there was also a female soldier.

769
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,620
That's right.

770
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,300
I figured that out too.

771
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,500
She is also from Beijing.

772
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,100
She is a violinist in the Art Troupe,

773
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,060
and is also in the hospital now.

774
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,260
What about Xiang Nan?

775
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,660
Xiang Nan went back home.

776
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,940
I was going to teach him a lesson,

777
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,060
but I found that around his house,

778
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,780
there were plainclothes police
everywhere.

779
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,940
So I didn't make a move.

780
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,620
I have been with those police

781
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,180
for so many years.

782
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,860
We know each other very well.

783
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,540
They know that

784
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,260
I, Jia Hui, will definitely take revenge.

785
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,060
It's normal for them to take precautions.

786
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,060
Boss,

787
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,940
Xiang Nan's house
is protected by the police,

788
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,260
and those three
are still in the military hospital.

789
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
What should we do?

790
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,980
Be patient, and keep an eye on them.

791
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,620
Sooner or later
they will walk out of the hospital.

792
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,940
Spread the word now

793
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,180
that I, Jia Hui,
will never allow Xiao Chunsheng

794
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,580
to leave Kunming alive.

795
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,020
Got it.

796
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,180
Having dinner?

797
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,620
Zhan Jun, why are you here?

798
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,460
Have you had dinner?

799
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,060
Yes, I have.

800
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,940
I'm here to ask you two
for some information.

801
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,460
Is it convenient now?

802
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,660
Of course.

803
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,620
We just finished eating.

804
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,420
Come on, Hongling.

805
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Thank you.

806
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,100
Your hand.

807
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,660
Be careful.

808
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,420
I'm fine.

809
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,340
Take your time.

810
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Come on, sit down.

811
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,420
Come on.

812
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Sit down.

813
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,580
How are you recovering?

814
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,660
Good.

815
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,300
Zhan Jun.

816
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,660
Are you here now

817
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,420
because you found something new?

818
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,300
In the past few days,

819
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
some very suspicious people

820
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,860
appeared around Xiang Nan's house

821
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,220
and the hospital.

822
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,940
And some people

823
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,900
are inquiring about

824
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,460
Chunsheng and you in various channels.

825
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,180
See?

826
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,860
I already told you

827
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,940
that Jia Hui

828
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,220
wouldn't let us go easily.

829
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,380
He has spread the word that

830
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,220
he would not allow Chunsheng

831
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,700
to leave Kunming alive.

832
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,700
He's pretty bold!

833
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,340
That's a letter of challenge!

834
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,860
OK,

835
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I'd like to see

836
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,780
how he could avenge his brother.

837
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,780
His own brother died,

838
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,900
he will surely make a big move.

839
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,780
Our superiors have ordered us

840
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,100
to seize this opportunity

841
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,260
and arrest Jia Hui and his accomplices.

842
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,580
So I came today

843
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,100
to discuss with you two about it,

844
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,580
and see if you have some good ideas.

845
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,500
Hongling,

846
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,100
why are you here alone?

847
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,260
It's stuffy in the room,

848
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
I came out for some fresh air.

849
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,740
Why did you come again?

850
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,140
What do you mean again?

851
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500
I care about you.

852
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,660
I brought you some supplements
for you to replenish your body,

853
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,900
so you can get better soon.

854
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,620
My injuries are almost healed.

855
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,140
Give this to Chunsheng and Duan Lei.

856
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,660
I brought them some, too.

857
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,300
Come on, let's go to Chunsheng now.

858
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,220
Wait a minute.

859
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,660
Captain Zhan of the Criminal Police Unit

860
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,500
is chatting with Chunsheng and Lei.

861
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
We should not disturb them.

862
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,780
Let's wait outside.

863
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,220
OK, let's sit a while here.

864
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,580
So you mean

865
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,100
as long as we both

866
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
stay in the hospital,

867
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,260
then Jia Hui

868
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,020
can't do anything to us?

869
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,020
Is that what you mean?

870
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,060
For now, you two are safe.

871
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,620
So you should use this time

872
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,900
to fully recover

873
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,020
from your injuries.

874
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,060
The moment you leave
the gate of this hospital,

875
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,580
our decisive battle with Jia Hui
will be on.

876
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,260
I'm all excited about it.

877
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,340
I can't wait!

878
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,260
Tell me, Chunsheng,

879
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,500
why are all you guys
from military families

880
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,140
so eager for battle?

881
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,780
We are not eager for battle.

882
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,220
We are just fearless.

883
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,780
Our fathers

884
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,700
went through

885
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,540
bloody war.

886
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,460
The education I received as a child

887
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,860
is that I should always be ready
to defend the country,

888
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,140
even if that means I have to shed

889
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,060
the last drop of my blood.

890
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,860
Well said!

891
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,500
Chunsheng, as a soldier,

892
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,180
this kind of fearless spirit
is what we should have.

893
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,500
Guohua,

894
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,260
you have been coming
to the hospital so often,

895
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,380
aren't you afraid
that someone will criticize you?

896
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,380
I'm a platoon leader
in the recruit company,

897
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,260
two of my soldiers were injured.

898
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,300
It's my duty to take care of them.

899
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,380
Why should I be criticized?

900
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,100
Moreover,

901
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,740
I can't stop worrying

902
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,780
until you are

903
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,260
fully recovered.

904
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,900
Thank you.

905
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,940
Come on.

906
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,340
Don't say that.

907
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
Our superiors have decided

908
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,140
to use Comrade Chunsheng as the bait.

909
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,700
And Lei, you'll help him.

910
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,140
But we must

911
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,580
ensure Chunsheng's safety.

912
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,060
If we don't have enough people,

913
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
we will ask the provincial
public security department for support.

914
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,740
We have weaved a big net in Kunming.

915
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,740
As long as he appears,

916
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,620
he won't get away.

917
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,780
I think it's a good idea.

918
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,420
As long as Jia Hui dares to come,

919
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,980
he will definitely be arrested.

920
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,380
Yes.

921
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,900
Chunsheng,

922
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,100
what do you think?

923
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,500
I think

924
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,340
since Jia Hui has been

925
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,060
dealing with you for many years,

926
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,660
he must know

927
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,980
what you are thinking.

928
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,500
And since he spread the word that

929
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,820
he's gonna kill me in Kunming,

930
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,100
he must know that

931
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,940
you would use me as a bait

932
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,620
to lure them out.

933
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,540
Do you think

934
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,020
he will come in person?

935
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,860
Chunsheng, you mean

936
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,740
Jia Hui already knows that the police

937
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,180
is protecting you in the dark,

938
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,540
and that there is a big net

939
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,860
waiting for him in Kunming.

940
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,340
So he won't throw himself into the trap

941
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
because he's not stupid, right?

942
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,740
Yes.

943
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,420
Jia Hui is not a fool.

944
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,540
But here comes the question,

945
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,420
if Jia Hui doesn't show up,

946
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,460
how will he avenge his brother?

947
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,740
Hongling, it is a bit late.

948
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,980
I have to go back now.

949
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,620
Please give these

950
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,100
to Chunsheng and Lei for me.

951
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,940
OK.

952
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,180
Aren't you gonna meet with Chunsheng?

953
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,260
I've seen him too much already.

954
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,460
I'm just glad I saw you.

955
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,540
I have to go.

956
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,580
Goodbye.

957
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,460
OK, time to say goodbye.

958
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,540
I'll go back and talk to the superiors

959
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,500
about your plan.

960
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,300
I think

961
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,220
they will accept your suggestion.

962
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,500
That was just my guess.

963
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,580
Jia Hui

964
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,060
might not think that way.

965
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,580
Actually,

966
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,700
what you just said made sense.

967
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,980
To be honest, Chunsheng,

968
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,980
with your ingenuity,

969
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,700
you would make a great criminal police.

970
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,500
Actually, you can think about it.

971
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
After taking off this military uniform,

972
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,780
maybe you can become a policeman.

973
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,540
Alright, stop it, Zhan Jun.

974
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,340
Give it up.

975
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,300
This young man

976
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,420
is going to wear the uniform
for a lifetime.

977
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,660
Lei knows me very well.

978
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,020
Chunsheng, Lei.

979
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,420
Thank you.

980
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,060
It is getting late.

981
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
You should have some rest.

982
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,500
I have to go.

983
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,780
- OK.
- Goodbye.

984
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,700
Get better soon.

985
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,100
See you.

986
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,700
Chunsheng.

987
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,580
Hongling.

988
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,300
You just finished?

989
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,980
It's so late already,

990
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
why are you downstairs alone?

991
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,820
Guohua came to visit you.

992
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,300
I was worried that he would
interrupt your conversation,

993
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,260
so I didn't let him in.

994
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,980
Look,

995
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,900
he brought you so much

996
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,180
nutritious food.

997
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,420
I'm glad he has a conscience.

998
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,820
He came to visit us with some presents.

999
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,300
Take these. They are heavy.

1000
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,220
Oh, give it to me.

1001
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,060
Come on, let's go back in to eat them.

1002
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,780
Come on.

1003
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,780
Boss,

1004
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,180
Xiao Chunsheng and Duan Lei

1005
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
will be leaving the hospital tomorrow.

1006
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,060
Is the information accurate?

1007
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,660
Yes.

1008
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,980
They have gone through
the discharge procedures.

1009
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,580
What about the Public Security Bureau?

1010
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,780
You guessed right, Boss.

1011
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,780
They have assembled a large police force

1012
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,780
led by Zhan Jun of the Criminal Police Unit.

1013
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,100
They are ambushing around the hospital,

1014
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,100
and waiting for you

1015
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,580
to show up.

1016
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,980
They really think I'm a fool.

1017
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,740
They want me to throw myself in the trap?

1018
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,620
In their dreams!

1019
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,420
Guan,

1020
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,460
Dayong,

1021
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,300
tell our brothers

1022
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,220
to follow my plan.

1023
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,660
Got it.

1024
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,300
Yes.

1025
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,900
My brother,

1026
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,340
rest assured,

1027
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,380
tomorrow will be
the death day of Xiao Chunsheng.

1028
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,580
I won't allow him

1029
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,420
to see the sun the day after tomorrow.

1030
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,620
(Outpatient)

1031
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,540
Hongling, just go back.

1032
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,260
Chunsheng,

1033
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,580
take care.

1034
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,780
You too.
