3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
I heard that

4
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,680
some foreigners invented an instrument

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,080
which can flash some light

6
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
in your injured parts,

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,400
and make your nerves,

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
blood vessels and muscles

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
recover.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,320
Don't laugh. It's true.

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,400
If this hospital

12
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
had these instruments,

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,360
we would have a cure.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,600
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Why do we not have a cure?

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,360
We don't have incurable diseases.

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,800
Sir, listen.

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Do the rehabilitation carefully

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,920
and it will work out.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,880
One month is the prime time.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
If we fail to recover during that,

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,920
we'll have no hope.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,440
Chunsheng, look who has come.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,720
There you are, Dong.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Come on, Chunsheng.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
You didn't tell me that you were back.

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Xiaomei told me what happened.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Listen to the doctors

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
and hurry with your rehabilitation.

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
After you recover,

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,600
I expect to fight with you again.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
When it's over here,

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,080
I'll take you out

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,040
for a better meal.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,120
Then, go to my place.

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,720
I'm teaching some disciples

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,600
and they're eager to see you, the hero.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm not a hero.

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Don't flatter me to the children.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Teasing me again, huh?

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Naughty.

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
Come on, guys.

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
See who I've brought you.

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,600
You... You must be
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng.

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,480
Master often talked about you.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,080
He did?

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,880
What did he say about me?

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,880
He said you went alone to Tian,

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,120
but before the fight, you became friends.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Dong,

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,760
this isn't very kind.

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
I went there alone

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
but you took off your hat
to stop the fight.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
I really doubt

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
if you told my story
to set off your own glory.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Stop joking. Don't listen to him.

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,560
Mr. Liang, shall we go have lunch?

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Yeah, Dong.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm hungry.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's have lunch.

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Go. Let's go for lunch.

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,120
OK.

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,720

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
Fine. You keep practicing.

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,440
We will.

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,120
It hurts.

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
It indicates blocked blood circulation.

Don't hide it.

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,560
I didn't.

90
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Why do I have

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,760
such an underdone daughter as you?

92
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,800
You spend hours around Xiao Chunsheng.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, he's crippled

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,840
but you still haven't given up.

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,280
If he can't stand up anymore,

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,280
will you take care of him all your life?

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,280
He will stand up.

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,200
You sound really confident.

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
But considering your qualification,

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,080
what gives you such confidence?

101
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm learning.

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,920
The ability to learn
doesn't equal the qualification.

103
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,240
Besides,

104
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,480
I think rehabilitation therapy is fun.

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,320
It's not only for Xiao Chunsheng.

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Rehabilitation therapy?

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,720
You sound decent.

108
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
It's just to take care of someone
and be his nurse.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,200
Mom, it's OK that others say this.

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
But you're a doctor.

111
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
How could you also talk like that?

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm feeling sorry for my daughter.

113
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Fine.

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
Now that you misinterpreted my point,

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,000
I won't interfere anymore.

116
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,540
(Unit One)

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Xiaomei,

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,560
when will you start your job in Beijing?

119
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
You told me

120
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
you needed some formalities.

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,080
Are they done?

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,480
It's not that easy.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,040
You know my father.

124
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
Asking him to pull strings

125
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,080
would be even harder
than not letting him fight a war.

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,240
Chunsheng, how about we try acupuncture?

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,560
What?

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
Acupuncture?

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,920
You can even do that?

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
I've been learning lately.

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
We can have a try.

132
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,440
If it hurts, let me know.

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,150
Hike up your trouser leg.

134
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,480
Is... Is it OK?

135
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Xiaomei,

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,560
did you learn acupuncture for me?

137
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,840
It requires accurate acupoints.

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm not sure about some.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
I have to ask more and learn more.

140
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,960
Sorry for this.

141
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,240
Any feelings?

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,480
Oh, Xiaomei,

143
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,120
did the doctor say

144
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
how long the rehabilitation would be?

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
Even a fracture takes 100 days.

146
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
You're so badly wounded.

147
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
It'll take over six months at least.

148
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
And,

149
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
as the old saying goes,

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,960
while prospects are bright,
the roads have twists and turns.

151
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

152
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
you have to hang in there.

153
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,080
Chen, Ye Fang told me

154
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,800
you applied for the job at the Customs.

155
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes.

156
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
But considering your marks,

157
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,800
you can try getting a job in a ministry.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,960
I've dreamed to work at the Customs.

159
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Economic and trade exchanges
between China and other countries

160
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,200
will get closer and closer.

161
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,440
The Customs is where

162
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
I can reach a bigger world.

163
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,480
It's not available in any other places.

164
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Concerning this,

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
we had a discussion with Ye Fang.

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
If you've made up your mind,

167
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
we will support you.

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,360
Ye Fang,

169
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,880
do you think the same way?

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Ye Fang,

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,040
for this case,

172
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,760
you had a result, didn't you?

173
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,760
Hongjun, I support you.

174
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,720
Mrs. Ye,

175
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
I remember you told me

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
you and Mr. Ye

177
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,160
had to worry

178
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,920
about my life and career.

179
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Now that Mr. Ye and Ye Fang support me,

180
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,160
I'll go on with my dream.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I won't think about a job in a ministry.

182
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
This time, I want to count on myself.

183
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,200
I've finished.

184
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm getting back for some books.

185
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,480
Enjoy the meal.

186
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,600
Ye Fang,

187
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,680
you talk about it with Hongjun.

188
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,240
At this moment,

189
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,400
he needs your support.

190
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
Now, all he thinks is

191
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm trying to disturb
his bright future and hurt him.

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,640
He won't listen at all.

193
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You feel it now, huh?

194
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,040
I asked you to get a man

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
of your own class.

196
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,760
But you got him.

197
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,320
See?

198
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,240
Before anything happens,

199
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,320
he keeps saying he'll count on himself.

200
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,040
When he really gets powerful,

201
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I won't expect him to pay us back.

202
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
I just want him not to bite
the hand that fed him.

203
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,120
Mom, Hongjun isn't that kind of man.

204
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,360
And,

205
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,360
could you stop

206
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
staring at him like that?

207
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,800
You keep forcing us

208
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
to obey your rules

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
or behave.

210
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,840
And you keep reminding us.

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Like if he disobeyed them,

212
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
he would be ruder

213
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
and feel inferior

214
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,520
and didn't even deserve
to sit and eat with us.

215
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,680
How could he ever feel good?

216
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm full, too.

217
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,600
Look, look.

218
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
What did I say?

219
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,120
I mean good for them, don't I?

220
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
I think

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,280
they made sense.

222
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Continue with the lunch.

223
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,720
Don't try to make peace.

224
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
Enjoy the food.

225
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,520
Will you eat or not?

226
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,320
No. I'm angry enough.

227
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,480
These are handicrafts. Have a look.

228
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,360
I'll give you a discount.

229
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,440
Buy some.

230
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,920
Sir, do you have FECs?
[*Foreign exchange certificate]

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
Madam, any FECs?

232
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,720
No.

233
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
Why didn't we see Mr. Ge lately?

234
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,640
Sir,

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
why hasn't Mr. Ge come these days?

236
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,040
That's right.

237
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,520
He didn't come these days.

238
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,400
Ask him.

239
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,120
Do you know where he lives?

240
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
You must be Tian, huh?

241
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,720
I don't mean to gossip,

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,000
but I heard Ge

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,440
met a big client.

244
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
He offers a higher price

245
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
so that Ge can pocket the difference.

246
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm afraid

247
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,040
you'll fail.

248
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
You may not find him.

249
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,640
Mr. Ge is going too far.

250
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,760
I'll go talk to him.

251
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
Forget it.

252
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Mr. Ge's wife is sick in bed

253
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,440
and his son is crippled.

254
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,200
You're right.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,360
Every family has its trouble.

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Let's go.

257
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Qi Tian, don't worry.

258
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,240
If the money exchange no longer works,

259
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,520
let's try something else.

260
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,880
Try something else to make money.

261
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
It's easy for you to say.

262
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,720
But what else can we do?

263
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,600
What else can we think of?

264
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,040
It may be hard for someone else.

265
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,640
But you're Qi Tian.

266
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,520
You will make it.

267
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,720
Yanqiu,

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
you...

269
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
You trust me?

270
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes.

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
And for this,

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
a toast to you.

273
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,400
Do you know

274
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,760
what a man needs most
when he's in trouble?

275
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,280
What?

276
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,440
Confidence.

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,120
Especially the confidence

278
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,240
from his beloved woman.

279
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,000
Yanqiu,

280
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,320
I really

281
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,120
feel grateful.

282
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,440
Don't bother to thank me.

283
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,920
I...

284
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,070
I want to be with you.

285
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,720
Have you... Have you made your decision?

286
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,320
Qi Tian,

287
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm older than you.

288
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
I don't have any money

289
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,040
and I'm not very pretty.

290
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,720
No, no.

291
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Hear me out.

292
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
You asked to be with me

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,240
and I'm really happy about that.

294
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,920
Actually, since I was born,

295
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,040
no one has pursued me,

296
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,600
except that fraud.

297
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,600
But I'm not beautiful.

298
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
I'm not smart.

299
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
I can't play the violin, either.

300
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
I have nothing in common

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,680
with those women you used to love.

302
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,480
Yanqiu, Yanqiu.

303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,960
Everyone can be young.

304
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,360
Everyone has all kinds of dreams, too.

305
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
But I... I'm no longer young.

306
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,720
I know what kind of woman
I should cherish.

307
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
I've made up my mind.

308
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You're the woman

309
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I should love and cherish.

310
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,880
If you don't fear you may regret it,

311
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
after Chunsheng recovers,

312
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
we can tell him about it

313
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,200
and pick a date.

314
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,200
We're no longer young.

315
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
And we shouldn't

316
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,160
play hard to get.

317
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
What's gone is gone.

318
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,800
As long as you don't let go of my hand,

319
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,040
I'll always be with you,
even if we live a poor life.

320
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop, stop.

321
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,040
I won't let you live a poor life.

322
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,160
I can't promise you big wealth.

323
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,760
But I can promise

324
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
that I'll make you happy

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,880
throughout your life.

326
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,660
(Long live great Mao Zedong Thought)

327
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,780
(Unit One)

328
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm home. You may leave.

329
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,920
OK.

330
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,040
Oh.

331
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,920
Umm...

332
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,400
Heizi hasn't got

333
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
the FECs for a long time.

334
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
I think something must be wrong.

335
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
I get it. Don't worry.

336
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,040
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

337
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,000
Well,

338
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
when can Chunsheng recover?

339
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
How about I talk to him in a day or two?

340
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,800
I should go.

341
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,640
Yan... Yanqiu.

342
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
Again,

343
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,560
no matter 100 thousand or 200 thousand,

344
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll make the money.

345
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Yanqiu, you're back.

346
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,960
Still awake?

347
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,720
Yanqiu,

348
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
you go out early and return late.

349
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,040
What are you up to?

350
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,320
Heizi and Qi Tian are doing business.

351
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm helping them.

352
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,160
Helping Tian to make money?

353
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Yanqiu, for Qi Tian,

354
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
you're even ignoring

355
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
your wounded brother.

356
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,600
Don't be ungrateful.

357
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,120
Every day, I never leave

358
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,640
before making the meal for you, do I?

359
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Besides,

360
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,600
someone has his exclusive doctor.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
Why would he still need me?

362
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,520
I would only be the third wheel.

363
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,120
Don't... Don't tease me.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,480
Yanqiu.

365
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Tian is a nice guy.

366
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
When you have such a good...

367
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,200
Go to bed early

368
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,360
and don't think too much.

369
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,800
I feel happy for you.

370
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,060
(Unit One)

371
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,840
It's OK.

372
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
Let's ask the doctor carefully.

373
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,280
There you are.

374
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,120
Hi, Yanqiu.

375
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,600
There you are.

376
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,920
Is it cold out there?

377
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,320
Would you like some tea?

378
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
No, thanks, Yanqiu.

379
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
I had something
to eat and drink before coming.

380
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,680
I'll take Chunsheng to the doctor.

381
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,120
Thank you.

382
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,800
Yanqiu, I should go.

383
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,400
OK.

384
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Stay safe.

385
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,800
Rest assured.

386
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,160
Doctor,

387
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,960
when can

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
my right leg

389
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
totally recover?

390
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,240
Be patient and stay positive.

391
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
Anxiety is the last thing
you should have.

392
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,200
You need proper exercise.

393
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,200
Do some exercise when you have time.

394
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,640
Chunsheng, go with the nurse
for some medicine.

395
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,200
I have something to ask the doctor.

396
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,040
Excuse me,

397
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,960
please get the medicine for me.

398
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,560
OK.

399
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,320
Thank you.

400
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Will Chunsheng's leg

401
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
really not recover?

402
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,160
Xiaomei, as a doctor,

403
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
I can't be 100% sure

404
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
that Chunsheng's leg can recover

405
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
or his leg can't.

406
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,680
But his current recovery

407
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,800
is still far from

408
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
what we expected.

409
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,960
His right leg

410
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,040
may be crippled for life.

411
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,640
I heard...

412
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,960
I heard about some
electromagnetic instruments abroad.

413
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,680
Can they cure Chunsheng's leg?

414
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Indeed.

415
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,080
There are more advanced instruments
in foreign countries.

416
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,880
But the recovery rate isn't 100%.

417
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,160
It still depends on the patient's condition.

418
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,880
And in China,

419
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,040
some of these instruments

420
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,880
haven't been vetted yet.

421
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,640
You can't risk them on Chunsheng.

422
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,840
But Chunsheng...

423
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,880
So far,

424
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,240
he's been expecting the rehabilitation
to get him back on his feet.

425
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
The doctor said

426
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,800
your condition was good.

427
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,200
Don't worry.

428
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
You have to cheer up.

429
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,040
As long as you keep the rehabilitation...

430
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,600
Xiaomei,

431
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I want to take the rehabilitation.

432
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,880
But it's getting late.

433
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
How about you go tomorrow?

434
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,840
I really want to stand up.

435
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,560
Fine.

436
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
Chunsheng, take some rest.

437
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,000
Have some water.

438
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,160
You had enough exercise today.

439
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,040
Go easy on yourself.

440
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,240
Chunsheng,

441
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,600
rehabilitation takes a long time.

442
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,280
It has to be gradual.

443
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
According to the doctor,

444
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,920
you can't rush it.

445
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,680
Otherwise,

446
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,600
you may get hurt again

447
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
with perverse effects.

448
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,240
Xiaomei, let go of me.

449
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
If you keep doing this,

450
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,360
you may really
not get back on your feet.

451
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,880
Just get to the point.

452
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm afraid of your sudden flattery.

453
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,080
Mom, here's the thing.

454
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,000
You know Chunsheng's leg...

455
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,880
Stop.

456
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,560
Just tell me what you want.

457
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,280
For your information,

458
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,360
I want your approval.

459
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
I hope you can get

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,160
some foreign
therapeutic instruments for Chunsheng.

461
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
Stop, stop.

462
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,120
You think we own the hospital?

463
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,200
And we can get any instrument we want

464
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,400
and even the foreign one?

465
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,360
Just do your daughter a big favor.

466
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,040
Big favor?

467
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,920
When my daughter wants
the stars and the moon,

468
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
how can I get them for her?

469
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,600
I won't ask for something so ridiculous.

470
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
The stars and the moon are ridiculous.

471
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
So is the foreign instrument, OK?

472
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,360
Tong Xiaomei,

473
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,000
what have you learned all these years?

474
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,920
Don't you know how hard it is?

475
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,920
I know it's hard.

476
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,520
That's why I'm begging you.

477
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,160
Don't try to flatter me.

478
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,840
Say no more. It won't happen.

479
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,080
Mom.

480
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
Let me make it clear.

481
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
My hospital can't get the instrument.

482
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,400
Nor can I.

483
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,160
If you can,

484
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,080
go get some yourself.

485
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,400
It's out of my hands, anyway.

486
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,320
Yesterday, I went to Jianguomen

487
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,600
and looked everywhere.

488
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,000
I nearly removed the buildings,

489
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,400
but I just didn't find those guys.

490
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,320
I thought

491
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,760
even if we couldn't find them,

492
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
we shouldn't waste the FECs.

493
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,920
Then I sent my minions to ask

494
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
if anyone could recover them.

495
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Guess what?

496
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880
When those who take FECs

497
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,400
heard this,

498
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,920
without a second thought,

499
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,080
they turned away immediately.

500
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,720
I realized

501
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,400
something must be wrong.

502
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
Later,

503
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
I suddenly saw a man

504
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,560
who stayed alone.

505
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,640
I then got him back.

506
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,040
Don't worry. I didn't beat him.

507
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,040
He's a coward.

508
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,680
I scared him and he confessed.

509
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Then I knew what happened.

510
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,640
In Beijing, FECs are

511
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
Sange's business.

512
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,400
One of his friends came lately.

513
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
This guy was

514
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
very interested in FECs

515
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
and wanted to wade in.

516
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,560
He even gave a tough talk

517
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,880
that no one should take

518
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
our FECs.

519
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,200
So, Yanqiu,

520
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,280
you didn't find Mr. Ge
near the Great Wall.

521
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,760
When I heard about it,

522
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,240
I guessed he was recruited

523
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,280
by Sange's friend.

524
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
Come on. We're in the modern age.

525
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,360
Economic market and fair competition.

526
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,440
How could this guy be so shameless?

527
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,160
Did you offend anyone?

528
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,440
Tian, what are you talking about?

529
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,400
Now I care about nothing but money.

530
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Who could I offend?

531
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,600
What about you?

532
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm not strong enough to offend anyone.

533
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,040
Nor am I.

534
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,320
Can he be someone you offended before?

535
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Before?

536
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
Well, before,

537
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,800
we indeed had some fights.

538
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,680
But we obeyed the rules.

539
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,920
And anyway,

540
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,480
who would take revenge

541
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,080
after so many years?

542
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,320
We don't...

543
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,000
We don't have a long-term enemy, do we?

544
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,440
No.

545
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,840
I'll give him a lesson.

546
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,000
How old are you

547
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
and what year is it?

548
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,560
Why do you still count on fighting?

549
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Sit down.

550
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,080
What do we do, then?

551
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,920
Should we waste all our FECs?

552
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,120
These days,

553
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,920
don't ask too much out there.

554
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,120
Let me think of a way.

555
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
Come on. Why do you bother?

556
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,800
Let's just beat him.

557
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll think of a way and tell you!

558
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,080
Fine, before dinner,

559
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,080
let me say something as usual.

560
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,600
Today is a good day,

561
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,920
July 16, 1981.

562
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,080
It's 6:38 now.

563
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,040
We're having a gathering here,

564
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,120
to congratulate Chen Hongjun

565
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,600
on passing the interview of the Customs

566
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,000
and formally becoming a civil servant.

567
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,200
Come on.

568
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,720
A toast to Comrade Chen Hongjun

569
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,880
who always works hard
and never slackens.

570
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Cheers.

571
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,520
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

572
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,280
Congratulations.

573
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,480
Thank you, Chunsheng.

574
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,720
I'll keep working hard.

575
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,800
Don't be cocky.

576
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,560
I have to say something else.

577
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,840
It's very important.

578
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,160
A toast to Comrade Ye Fang

579
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,760
who has always kept Chen Hongjun company.

580
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,120
Me?

581
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,360
If you hadn't appreciated him,

582
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,160
if you hadn't cultivated

583
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,960
and reminded him,

584
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,640
Chen Hongjun

585
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,560
couldn't have been successful so soon.

586
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,720
Come on. Raise your glasses.

587
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,920
Here.

588
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,680
Come on.

589
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,600
Thanks.

590
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,440
- To Fang.
- Thank you.

591
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,640
To Fang.

592
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,760
Hongjun, always be nice to her.

593
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,320
I'll keep it in mind, Chunsheng.

594
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,600
Today,

595
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,000
Hongjun and I have something to tell you.

596
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,680
What's that?

597
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,600
Hongjun,

598
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,760
I heard what happened that day.

599
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,240
I have to apologize to you.

600
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,680
I didn't mean that.

601
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,360
Fang,

602
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
say... say no more.

603
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
Actually, I really know

604
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,360
what you think of me.

605
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,760
Umm...

606
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,440
Now,

607
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,640
I have something to tell Ye Fang.

608
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Sit down.

609
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,840
Sit down.

610
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,120
Sit.

611
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,880
You're all here.

612
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
I want to tell Ye Fang
something from the heart.

613
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,840
You can be my witnesses.

614
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,000
OK. Go ahead.

615
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,200
Fang, all along,

616
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
I've been grateful to you

617
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,040
for always helping me,

618
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,760
tolerating me,

619
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,600
and accompanying me.

620
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,560
Actually, I'm a man

621
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,040
with many drawbacks.

622
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,120
Sometimes, you just think
I don't make progress

623
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,440
and you're disappointed.

624
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,640
I'm aware, actually.

625
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
But from this day on,

626
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm willing to change myself for you.

627
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,280
Because I want

628
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,280
to spend the rest of my life with you.

629
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,840
What are you waiting for?

630
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
Put the rings on.

631
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,080
- Put them on.
- Go ahead.

632
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
Hurry.

633
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,520
Put it on her.

634
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,320
- Put it on her.
- Come on, do that.

635
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,240
Hurry.

636
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,240
Don't be shy. Come on.

637
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,080
You put on the rings.

638
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Isn't it time

639
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,360
to kiss?

640
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,280
Yeah.

641
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,040
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Kiss! Kiss!

642
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,760
Don't tease us.

643
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,720
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Kiss! Kiss!

644
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
Hongjun, don't be shy.

645
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,000
Kiss her. Hurry.

646
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,960
Kiss.

647
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Nice!

648
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,840
Great!

649
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
OK. Come on.

650
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,600
Best wishes.

651
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,360
- Best wishes.
- Hope you'll grow old together.

652
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,120
Drink slowly.

653
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,320
Tian,

654
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,240
when will you marry my sister?

655
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,040
We... We are not in a hurry.

656
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,560
You need to be taken care of.

657
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,720
Yanqiu, rest assured.

658
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,200
My leg is crippled

659
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,520
but I can still marry you to him.

660
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,400
What are you talking about?

661
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,840
Listen to me and get married soon.

662
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,840
I... I don't like it

663
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,280
when you watch me every day.

664
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,360
I've been longing for freedom.

665
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,720
I can live alone.

666
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
Don't be naughty.

667
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,720
It hurts.

668
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,200
All right. Enjoy your food.

669
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,640
OK. Let's eat.

670
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,560
It's getting cold.

671
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,760
Chunsheng,

672
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,680
after I work in the Customs,

673
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,280
I'll get you a good job.

674
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,120
Chunsheng,

675
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,560
our business...

676
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,760
It's in some trouble now.

677
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,800
But it's... It's OK.

678
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
When your right leg recovers,

679
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,520
- you can...
- Why would you wait?

680
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,520
Don't bother to wait.

681
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,320
I can arrange a job now.

682
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,760
What can you arrange?

683
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,640
I... I know about anti-smuggling work.

684
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,040
The police have to run all the time.

685
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,160
Even when your leg recovers...

686
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,480
You...

687
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,840
When you just recover,
you can't run like that.

688
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,360
Then don't be a policeman.

689
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,600
Is it OK?

690
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,080
He can be a clerk.

691
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,320
Right, Yanqiu?

692
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,200
A clerk.

693
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,600
Talk less.

694
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,120
Wait, wait.

695
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,600
He can't be a clerk.

696
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,640
A clerk has to be a high school graduate.

697
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Work in the logistics, then.

698
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,360
He can do that, I'm sure.

699
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,360
- It's an easy job.
- Say no more.

700
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,560
Easy.

701
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Chunsheng, tomorrow...

702
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,720
Tomorrow, I'll call them.

703
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,680
I'll have your job arranged.

704
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,240
Chunsheng,

705
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,000
come work with us.

706
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,040
Come.

707
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,840
There'll be...

708
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,640
There'll be no lifelong jobs.

709
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,560
It's not good to be a civil servant.

710
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Not good.

711
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,640
Who said that?

712
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,360
You... You don't understand.

713
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,720
You're recruited.

714
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,880
- But you haven't got a position yet.
- Xiaomei,

715
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,130
- I'm going out for some fresh air.
- Then you and I...

716
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,040
Who isn't a civil servant shall drink.

717
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,640
Let me go with you.

718
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,200
It's OK. I can go alone.

719
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,600
The market economy will reign.

720
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,840
Come on, let's do this.

721
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,360
Yanqiu, watch them.

722
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,920
They're drunk.

723
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
I'll go have some fresh air.

724
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,840
Right.

725
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,720
You drink.

726
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,880
I'll... I'll...

727
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,360
I won't drink with you.

728
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,400
Fine, I'll drink alone, then.

729
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,960
- Come on, cheers.
- Hey, you two.

730
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,560
Don't drink that much.

731
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,320
- Don't drink that much. Too much.
- I drank it up.
