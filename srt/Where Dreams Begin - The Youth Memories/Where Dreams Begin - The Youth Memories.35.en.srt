2
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,820
=Episode 35=

3
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,800
You never talked to me

4
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,920
about Chunsheng,

5
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,560
were you afraid that
I might ask you to have a baby?

6
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
Is that so?

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
You're overthinking.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,440
Ye Fang,

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
I wonder

10
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,280
if you and I can try it again.

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Hongjun,

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
you must be tired.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Go take a bath.

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll take it later.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm serious.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,160
Let's try it again.

17
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Just one more time.

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,840
Ye Fang.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,520
Hongjun, don't.

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
Don't do this.

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,040
Ye Fang.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Hongjun!

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,840
Chen Hongjun,

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
this isn't necessary.

25
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,940
(To Lin: Happy birthday!
Love from Hongjun.)

26
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,920
Ventilators are

27
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
what we have invested most in

28
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
and expanded fastest for,

29
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,120
next to our blockbusters

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
such as implantable heart-pacemakers
and intelligent prosthetics.

31
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Now, we produce adult ventilators

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
and child ventilators.

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,440
And tomorrow, we plan

34
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,400
to open

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
a new production line
of babe ventilators.

36
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
This is the high frequency

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,390
oscillating ventilator
we'll produce with Huasheng.

38
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,480
At present, the high frequency
oscillation technology

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,760
internationally adopts the standards

40
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,080
of US Food and Drug Administration.

41
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Assisted ventilation
of 150 times a minute.

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
But we've conquered

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
the technology of 15-17 hertz.

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,640
Among Chinese medical companies,

45
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
only we have got

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,920
this technology.

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,000
That's why

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
we're confident
in the cooperation with Huasheng.

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,880
I planned

50
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
to have dinner together

51
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
after today's meeting.

52
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,400
In my company,

53
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
there are a lot of your acquaintances.

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
Xiang Dong, Xiaoliu.

55
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Cap, Cap-opener.

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,320
Hello, Mr. Ye.

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Hello, Mr. Ye.

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
(In the past few years
without contacting each other,)

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
(an invisible barrier appeared)

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
(between these old friends.)

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,600
(Ye Guohua knew nothing)

62
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
(about what Xiao Chunsheng was doing.)

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
(After his demobilization,)

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,800
(he was inwardly competing
with Xiao Chunsheng)

65
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,120
(and wouldn't contact Xiao
until he succeeded.)

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
(But it seemed)

67
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,680
(that Xiao Chunsheng never
thought of Ye Guohua as a competitor.)

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,920
Tell me.

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
What's up?

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
Come on, you know it.

71
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,600
I heard

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,960
Ye Guohua went to Chunxiao today.

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,960
But didn't you promise me the order?

74
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
You know what a man

75
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,280
Xiao Chunsheng is.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,760
He always takes the bread
out of someone's mouth.

77
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,880
If he could cooperate with you,

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,080
you wouldn't have tried that hard

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
to kick him out
of the Anti-smuggling Squad.

80
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,760
We've been cooperating for years.

81
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,240
My pains also count,

82
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,080
even without gains.

83
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,600
I've decided to divorce my wife.

84
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
Our proportion of the profit

85
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
should be adjusted, right?

86
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Of course.

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
That's roughly the case.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,560
The high frequency
oscillating ventilators

89
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,040
you plan to purchase from us

90
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,480
have been registered
with National Medical Products Administration.

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,400
They definitely meet
your purchasing standards.

92
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,640
And our capacity of production
is also one of the best in Beijing.

93
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,120
So, Mr. Ye...

94
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,080
Excuse me.

95
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,200
(Put off the cooperation. Don't rush.)

96
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,640
Mr. Ye, any other problems?

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,960
I've got a general idea.

98
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
But this is a very big order

99
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
and I need a meeting for discussion

100
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
with the senior management.

101
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,120
You should be cautious.

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
It's the first cooperation

103
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,150
between us, after all.

104
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
When there's a decision,

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
I'll contact you immediately.

106
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,280
See you.

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
Mr. Guo, walk them out.

108
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Ye Guohua is way too arrogant.

109
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,120
He has no consideration
for brotherhood at all.

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
Business is business.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,040
The overseas order

112
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,240
marks Huasheng's first step
into the overseas market.

113
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,320
It's understandable
to carefully choose a partner.

114
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
We should have confidence.

115
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
As far as I know, Huasheng

116
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,360
cooperated with Li Shangyou's company.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,480
Since when did Ye Guohua

118
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,560
hook up with them?

119
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,680
Tian,

120
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
let's just do our jobs

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
and don't bother about anyone else.

122
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Sorry, Fang.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,720
You had to cook even when visiting me.

124
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,960
But you cook the fish

125
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,120
really very well.

126
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
I didn't cook for a long time

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,760
and couldn't do it as well as before.

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,440
Here. Taste some.

129
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,640
Let me see if it tastes as before.

130
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
A little bit fishy, huh?

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
I forgot to use the ginger.

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Chef,

133
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,720
you failed your specialty, huh?

134
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,760
How's everything going at school?

135
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Good.

136
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you remember I told you

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
about the academic title?

138
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,640
It's almost settled.

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,840
Then should I call you Prof. Ye?

140
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
How's Hongjun doing lately?

141
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,280
I just realize

142
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,480
I made very little food.

143
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
I'll go make another dish.

144
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,000
No need.

145
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
We eat alone and can't finish one more.

146
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Three dishes are enough.

147
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,680
Lately,

148
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,640
I often thought about our school days.

149
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,560
We never worried about anything then.

150
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,560
When we think of the past,

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
does it mean we're aging?

152
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,520
We're indeed no longer young.

153
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,800
Many things are no longer
what they used to be.

154
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,360
Enjoy the food.

155
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,280
Mr. Chen,

156
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,440
did you enjoy yourself?

157
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Did you?

158
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,800
What do you think?

159
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,680
You did, of course.

160
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,040
Mr. Li,

161
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
that was good wine.

162
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
I'll buy two boxes of it.

163
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
You don't need to.

164
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,480
I've prepared them for you.

165
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,440
And they'll be delivered to your house.

166
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,080
Thank you, then.

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,840
My pleasure.

168
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm going home.

169
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,800
Stay safe.

170
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,440
Money

171
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
is such a great thing.

172
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
It made a silent man like him

173
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,240
reveal his true colors.

174
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm back.

175
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,800
Keep dancing.

(Marriage Certificate, Real Estate Certificate,

177
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
When did you find this house?

178
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,920
I guessed.

179
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
But I just discovered it today.

180
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
You can't have got

181
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,040
these things today, huh?

182
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
You prepared them a long time ago,

183
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,360
didn't you?

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Ye Fang,

185
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
we've been living together for years.

186
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
Do you know why

187
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
I start to hate you?

188
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
And later,

189
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,160
I didn't even

190
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
want to touch you.

191
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,640
Just because of how you look.

192
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,720
Just because of how indifferent you look!

193
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,680
Whatever I ask you, you don't answer.

194
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,040
I never know

195
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,400
what's in your mind.

196
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,320
And

197
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
for everything,

198
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,840
you make early arrangements.

199
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,920
Even if it's none of your business,

200
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,800
you make decisions, too. You never care.

201
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
You never care about how others feel.

202
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,680
Do you really think you're a prophet?

203
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,360
Why can I never make even one decision?

204
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
Why must you call the shots?

205
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,960
You've made all the decisions.

206
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,560
I haven't made even a single one.

207
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,800
Why?

208
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,400
Why?

209
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
Answer me!

210
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,560
Then think,

211
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
was I ever wrong?

212
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
You're right.

213
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,000
I accept it.

214
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
You want a divorce.

215
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,200
I accept it.

216
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,120
The flat and the money

217
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
will be yours.

218
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,520
After all,

219
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
I did the wrong thing.

220
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,880
No need.

221
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,120
I don't need any of that.

222
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,040
I'll leave everything, anyway.

223
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,640
Don't worry.

224
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll take away what I deserve.

225
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
And about your stuff,

226
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,240
even if you leave it, I won't accept it.

227
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
You can leave it for guilt.

228
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,120
But legally,

229
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,720
we must make everything clear.

230
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
As you wish.

231
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Ye Fang,

232
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,080
where will you live, then?

233
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,120
Don't worry.

234
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,280
I have somewhere to live

235
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
and I won't suffer.

236
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,760
Let me remind you one last time.

237
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
Li Shangyou isn't a good friend.

Fang?

242
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,200
Have some tea for soothing.

243
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,520
Thanks.

244
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,680
Guohua called Chunsheng,

245
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,920
asking if you were here.

246
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,000
Let Chunsheng tell my brother

247
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,600
that I'll live here for a couple of days

248
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,160
before I find a flat and move out.

249
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,240
May I know what happened?

250
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,880
Hongjun called my brother, right?

251
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,000
He must have told you guys.

252
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,400
Guohua said

253
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,640
you were just too angry.

254
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,040
He said I was unreasonable

255
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,000
and dramatic.

256
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,840
What are you laughing at?

257
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Do you know what Chunsheng said?

258
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,920
He said among his friends

259
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,360
who grew up with him,

260
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,080
Ye Fang was the least dramatic.

261
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
Maybe it was just because
I wasn't dramatic.

262
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,480
What on earth happened?

263
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,360
I would never expect that.

264
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
The child is even three years old.

265
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,720
How long has he been keeping it?

266
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,640
In this case,

267
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,320
Hongjun is really terrible.

268
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Three years.

269
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,920
How could he possibly do that?

270
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,640
Something's wrong.

271
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
Considering Hongjun's temper,

272
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
he couldn't have kept this secret.

273
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,440
Listen, it can't be that simple.

274
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
Someone must have helped him secretly.

275
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Are you saying...

276
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,320
Anyway, no matter who helped him,

277
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
it doesn't make any sense now.

278
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,960
To Fang,

279
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,400
it's just frustrating.

280
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't worry.

281
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Fang is very strong.

282
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,840
Such a problem won't crush her.

283
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,680
Come on.

284
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,600
Come to me.

285
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
What are you thinking?

286
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm thinking

287
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,840
about what Fang just said to me.

288
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,960
What?

289
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,040
She said

290
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,720
Chen Hongjun wasn't to blame alone.

291
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,920
She was wrong, too.

292
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,960
She was wrong?

293
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,720
What does that mean?

294
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,160
I wanted a life partner,

295
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,160
who is decent, simple, and aggressive.

296
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,360
When I looked around,

297
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,440
Hongjun was the most suitable.

298
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
But it's actually a matter of two.

299
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,640
A man and a woman.

300
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,600
This kind of thing can't be planned.

301
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,320
Actually, life can't be planned.

302
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,320
I thought it could be, though.

303
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,400
I was too overbearing.

304
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,280
My marriage failed

305
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,360
but it didn't surprise me.

306
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
Are you saying

307
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,600
you don't have love

308
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,920
for Hongjun?

309
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,360
I'm not sure.

310
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,960
I know what love is.

311
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,360
Maybe I'm just too selfish.

312
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,320
The total reason is

313
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,720
I don't want a baby

314
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,560
and what's more,

315
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I don't love him enough.

316
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,400
I used to think love was childish.

317
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
Just like how my brother loves Hongling

318
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,040
and Hongling loves...

319
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,400
Now, I think maybe I'm wrong.

320
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,920
Love is good.

321
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
It's true, at least.

322
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
She said Hongling still loved you.

323
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Xiaomei,

324
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,840
don't be misled by Fang.

325
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,040
What do you mean?

326
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,240
How was I misled?

327
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
Think about it.

328
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,880
She and Chen Hongjun had their problem.

329
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
Don't apply her words

330
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
to anyone else.

331
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,600
You shouldn't think

332
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,880
only desperate love is true love.

333
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,760
That kind of love is at most

334
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,240
an emotion.

335
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,600
Emotion?

336
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,680
Think about it.

337
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
In that love, you hurt yourself

338
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
and someone else.

339
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,120
That's obviously an emotion.

340
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
When we really love someone,

341
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,000
we don't need to act fiercely

342
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,760
or force her.

343
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,360
Instead, we appreciate her
and want her to be happy.

344
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,920
I know.

345
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,760
OK, it's late. Get to sleep.

346
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,440
By the way,

347
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,640
Ye Fang said Chen Hongjun
and Li Shangyou had something fishy

348
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
and asked you to be alert.

349
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,640
OK, I get it.

350
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,680
Now, no other companies in China

351
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,720
can meet the requirements of Huasheng.

352
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,480
We'll get the order sooner or later.

353
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,280
What we should do now
is production planning.

354
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,840
Start the production now?

355
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
But Tian, I heard

356
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,160
Chen Hongjun and Li Shangyou

357
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,280
went to the suburbs the other day.

358
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,400
It's nothing. Don't overthink.

359
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
Li Shangyou doesn't matter at all.

360
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,400
Right, Li Shangyou doesn't matter.

361
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,680
But don't forget about Chen Hongjun.

362
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,160
What is he now?

363
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
The deputy director-general
of the Customs.

364
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,320
And he's Ye Guohua's brother-in-law.

365
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,640
At this moment, Li Shangyou

366
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
approached Chen Hongjun.

367
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,720
Isn't that obvious?

368
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Someone like him flattered Chen

369
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
and he must be up to something.

370
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
What do you mean?

371
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,800
Does he also want this project?

372
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,920
It doesn't matter
if he wants this project.

373
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,080
I mean

374
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
do we need

375
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,880
to flatter Chen Hongjun?

376
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
Tian, I'm not trying to scare you.

377
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,600
But Chen Hongjun and Chunsheng

378
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
can't get along very well

379
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,560
for quite a few years.

380
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,440
At this critical moment,

381
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,400
if you and I don't take our stand,

382
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,520
our fortune will be gone, won't it?

383
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,880
In recent years,
the profit of domestic orders

384
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,440
has been declining.

385
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,400
You know that.

386
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,800
Money will be gone.

387
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,200
Come on, don't do anything unnecessary.

388
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,120
You know what kind of man Chunsheng is.

389
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,000
It's OK

390
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,920
that you said this to me.

391
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,160
But don't bring it up in front of him.

392
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,080
I won't.

393
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,720
Heizi,

394
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,240
are you in trouble lately?

395
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,840
Why do you keep talking about money?

396
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,400
No, no trouble at all.

397
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
All right, then.

398
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,840
You have to make money little by little.

399
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,400
There's no such thing as free lunch.

400
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,480
I get it.

401
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Hongjun,

402
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,080
you and Ye Fang really can't get back?

403
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,000
You tell me.

404
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,200
How can we get back?

405
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,400
You know what I did.

406
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
In this case,

407
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,680
she came to my place

408
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,360
and I had to keep some dignity.

409
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
You know how stubborn your sister is.

410
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,280
When I went back home,

411
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,320
she got the divorce agreement ready.

412
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,200
When she decided something,
I could never object.

413
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,240
What could I do?

414
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Kneel and beg her?

415
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,480
Forget it. Let it be.

416
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,840
Sometimes,

417
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,480
when a couple lives together for long,

418
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
they need a change.

419
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,720
We're off my thing, then.

420
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,880
What about you?

421
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
How was your talk to Chunsheng?

422
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
Guohua,

423
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,480
I don't mean to nag,

424
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,120
but it's been so many years.

425
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680
Why do you still mind that much?

426
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
Did Hongling see him?

427
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,760
Why do you bring this up?

428
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,600
What does it have to do with Hongling?

429
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,280
See?

430
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,920
Every time I ask, you get angry.

431
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,640
It's OK, all right?

432
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,800
We're no longer young.

433
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,520
In some cases, don't be irascible.

434
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,360
I'm not irascible.

435
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,120
It's OK that you're irascible in love.

436
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,200
But in business, be very patient.

437
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
That day, you suddenly texted me

438
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,200
to put off the contract signing.

439
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,160
Why?

440
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Li Shangyou came to me.

441
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Li Shangyou?

442
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Didn't you cover it?

443
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,400
You can't let anyone else know

444
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,280
that he invited you to his fishing farm.

445
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,880
So what?

446
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,080
Now, I'm in charge.

447
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,800
What did he want from you?

448
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,560
What do you think?

449
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,840
Hongjun,

450
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
I still hold my point.

451
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,920
I can't give this order to Li Shangyou.

452
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,280
You know that.

453
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,000
It's the biggest order
I've had for this year.

454
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,840
If anything goes wrong,

455
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,640
I'll have to be screwed.

456
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,200
And I checked.

457
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Only Chunxiao has that core technology.

458
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,160
Anyway, don't promise Li Shangyou.

459
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,520
I can't interfere

460
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,240
with Ye Fang and you.

461
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,000
We've been best buddies for years.

462
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,880
Don't get me in trouble.

463
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,440
Rest assured, Guohua.

464
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,190
You're the last person I'll set up.

465
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,710
I know how far to go.

466
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,960
Tell me what you're going to do.

467
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,600
That's just technology.

468
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,560
They can have it. So can Li Shangyou.

469
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,840
His production condition isn't poor.

470
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,710
They're likely to reach the standard

471
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,320
in the near term.

472
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,670
What do you mean?

473
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, from now on,

474
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,560
you and I stay out of this.

475
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,040
Li Shangyou will handle it alone.

476
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,920
Through my connections
over the years, I got to know

477
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,160
Heizi lost so much in the stock market

478
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
that he would be bankrupt.

479
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
Now, he's as restless
as ants on a hot pan

480
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,840
and he won't get very far.

481
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,560
When we go to him now,

482
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,240
we'll be providing timely help.

483
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,640
Will Heizi

484
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,760
betray Xiao Chunsheng that easily?

485
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,040
It's a hard task for you.

486
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,560
But for me, it's nothing.

487
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
If he gets caught,

488
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
he'll go to jail, right?

489
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
For our business,

490
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,880
Heizi will only offer some information.

491
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,080
He can lose nothing.

492
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,360
And we can assure him

493
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,760
we won't tell

494
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,440
it's he who gave us
Chunxiao's core technology.

495
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,320
So, in this case,

496
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,520
everything is under control.

497
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Director Chen, with your wise plan,

498
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,520
we're gonna nail this.

499
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,800
Heizi, shall we talk?

500
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,680
About what?

501
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,400
Don't you want to know

502
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
why I came to you?

503
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,680
I know what is worrying you now.

504
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,720
You lost money in the stock market, huh?

505
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,200
You even borrowed from a loan shark.

506
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,960
Right?

507
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
It's just money.

508
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,880
I have a lot.

509
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,640
How much do you need? Tell me.

510
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,840
I can give you as much as you want.

511
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,480
OK?

512
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,840
But let me remind you.

513
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,120
Don't lose all your money.

514
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,360
Or even I couldn't help you.

515
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,560
Mr. Kind,

516
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,040
you need a price to help someone, right?

517
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,840
Clever guy.

518
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,160
I indeed want you to do me a favor.

519
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,880
No one can do this, except you.

520
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,960
Heizi,

521
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
I promise you.

522
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,200
After you do this,

523
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,880
I'll tell you where Xiaohui is.

524
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,400
What do you want me to do?

525
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,600
What?

526
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,200
How was today's work?

527
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,400
Not bad.

528
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,400
The client was satisfied
with our products.

529
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,200
Glad to hear that.

530
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,720
Oh, Chunsheng,

531
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,960
I've been thinking about something.

532
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,040
Beibei will have her birthday, right?

533
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,560
How about

534
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,920
we invite our friends to dinner

535
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
and celebrate her birthday?

536
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
We haven't seen each other for long.
We can get a gathering

537
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,800
and have some fun.

538
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,000
OK. It's up to you.

539
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,560
But do remember

540
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,600
to invite all our friends.

541
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,080
Dr. Tong, don't worry.

542
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,440
I will do as I'm told.

543
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,440
Hongjun,

544
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,120
I still decide

545
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,760
I can't give this order to Li Shangyou.

546
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,680
I can't risk Huasheng's future.

547
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,920
(Beibei's birthday is coming.)

548
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,600
(Guohua, we sincerely invite
you and Hongling.)

549
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,720
Why are you drinking alone?

550
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
What did you do today?

551
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
He Hongling,

552
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,360
I'm talking to you.

553
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,320
You always remain spiritless

554
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
and pull a long face.
Who are you upsetting?

555
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,920
If you don't want to see me like this,

556
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
get a new wife.

557
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,920
I won't argue with you.

558
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,200
Chunsheng texted me today.

559
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
Xiao Beibei will have her birthday

560
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,120
and he invited us to dinner.

561
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,000
If you don't want to go,

562
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,360
just don't go.

563
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,220
(Sweetie, happy birthday!)

564
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,600
(To dear Xiao Beibei.)

565
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,960
Mom, Mom, is it done?

566
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,080
Can I have some cake now?

567
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,320
Soon, soon.

568
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
You can have it soon.

569
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,080
Go play with your friends.

570
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,280
Oh.

571
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,200
Look.

572
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,760
They gave you so many presents.

573
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,520
Did you say thank you to them?

574
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,440
Yes, yes.

575
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,200
We're all waiting to have some cake.

576
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,240
Well,

577
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,960
we can't cut it until everyone comes.

578
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,360
Let's go have some fun over there.

579
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,120
- Go. Go for the balloons.
- Go.

580
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:23,960
Go.

581
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,760
Guohua.

582
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,080
Chunsheng.

583
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,360
Xiaomei.

584
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,960
Guohua.

585
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Beibei, come on.

586
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,440
Guohua, this is my daughter Beibei.

587
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,240
Beibei, this is Mr. Guohua

588
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,720
who grew up with your father.

589
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,800
Call him Godfather.

590
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,880
Nice to meet you, Godfather.

591
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,240
Nice to meet you, Beibei.

592
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,080
Where's Hongling?

593
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,680
She's too busy

594
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,840
to come.
