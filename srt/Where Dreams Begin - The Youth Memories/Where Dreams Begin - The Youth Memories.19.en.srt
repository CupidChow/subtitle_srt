00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,020
(Outpatient)

4
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,740
(Dispensary, Nurse Station)

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,880
My wound?

6
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,760
It... It's recovering very well.

7
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,040
Yanqiu, let me tell you this.

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,680
Now, I can... I can walk and jump.

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,520
It's true.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,320
Just some flesh wounds.

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,640
Don't worry about me.

12
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm not very busy lately.

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,320
How about I go and see you?

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,760
Yanqiu,

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
don't do that.

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
If you come,

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,360
who will take care of Dad?

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh, I forgot that.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,280
Don't worry about me.

20
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,800
Listen, Yanqiu.

21
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,030
In... In a few days,

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm going back to the army.

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm serious.

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
Where's Dad?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Put him on the phone.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
I have to tell him the whole story.

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
He just fell asleep.

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,320
Forget it, then.

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,320
Let him have a good sleep.

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,760
If I wake him up,

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
he'll scold me.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
Xiao Chunsheng, checkup time.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Be right there.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
Yanqiu, I have to do the checkup.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,520
I'll hang up.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
You take care, too. And take care of Dad.

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,480
Bye.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Two pieces of shrapnel
are deep in your body.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,680
The diameter is

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,040
between 0.3mm and 5.5mm.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,520
We speculate

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,680
the two pieces of shrapnel

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,920
are compressing your spine
and nearby nerves

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,480
so that you have backache
and leg dysfunction.

45
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,320
Then Doctor,

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
can I recover?

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Can I stand up and return to the army?

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,400
It depends on the operation you'll take.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
When... When can I have the operation?

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Come on, Doctor.

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm OK with anything you say.

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,080
To tell you the truth,

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,080
our hospital

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
can't perform such an operation.

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
Spinal nerves are complicated.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,360
Even the slightest lapse

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
can result in irreparable damage.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,440
Is it possible

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,440
to have this operation in Beijing?

60
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,480
I've never worked in a hospital there.

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,040
But yes, I guess.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,760
After all, medical conditions
in Beijing are much better.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
There are many awesome doctors, too.

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Would it be better

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
if he returns to Beijing soon?

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
If possible,

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,120
we certainly encourage
an early operation.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
The conservative therapy
can't heal him, after all.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
And,

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
his condition may get worse.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,080
Well,

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
you think about it.

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
I'll go check on other patients.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,480
Medical conditions here
are indeed limited.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
But don't worry.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Later, I will call

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
my former colleagues

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,680
and ask them to contact an expert

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,440
who can give you another checkup.

80
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,120
You will get better.

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,380
(Unit One)

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,960
Xiaomei said,

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
he's all right.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
Stop worrying, OK?

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
I can't.

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Chunsheng never kept us worried.

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
He didn't tell us even when he was hurt.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
Yunnan is so far away.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,080
How can I know he wasn't lying?

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,680
Even if he lied, Xiaomei wouldn't.

91
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
Xiaomei always listens to him.

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
You're just worried about nothing.

93
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
That was just a false alarm.

94
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Don't scare yourself.

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,320
You're off tomorrow.

96
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
How about we go out for a walk

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,760
in case you imagine things at home?

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,000
Chunsheng.

99
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
There you are, Lei.

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,600
Come on. Sit.

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,360
How do you feel now?

102
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm fine. Be careful.

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,320
Be careful.

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm OK. I'm OK.

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Here.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
Lei, have some fruit.

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
You know what?

108
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,760
It's from Guohua.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't waste it.

110
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Chunsheng,

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
looks like

112
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
I misunderstood Platoon Leader Ye.

113
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
You have no idea.

114
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
When he and I went back for you,

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,520
the enemies were firing fiercely.

116
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
He charged forward desperately.

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,080
When he heard the explosion
in the minefield,

118
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
a man like him

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,360
fell to the ground

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
and wailed for you.

121
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
He is

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,240
a friend indeed.

123
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,280
Of course, he is.

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,080
He and I grew up together.

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
Come on, Lei.

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
You used to judge people with prejudice

127
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
and underestimate them.

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Listen.

129
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
After we recover

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
and return to the army,

131
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
you have to cooperate with his work.

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,280
OK.

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,880
Well, it's also great for Guohua

134
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,040
to have a friend like you.

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
You don't know yet, huh?

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
It's quickly spreading.

137
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,080
What's spreading?

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
About Guohua.

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
He rushed alone into the enemy camp

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,240
and brought back M101 Coordinate.

141
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
He's now a big hero.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,550
What's wrong?

143
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,600
Nothing.

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
It's great that Guohua became a hero.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Yeah.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,720
But Chunsheng,

147
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm confused about something.

148
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,680
Let me ask you.

149
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,160
How did you step on a landmine?

150
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,280
Previously,

151
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
we had the demining many times

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
and you never stepped on one.

153
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,120
I... I just...

154
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,560
I just had an accident.

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,080
What?

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
After I got wounded on the battlefield,

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,880
you would still criticize me?

158
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,800
Who would criticize you?

159
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,760
There you are, Guohua.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,520
- Lei.
- Guohua.

161
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,360
Hongling.

162
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Come on.

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
Your eyes nearly pop out.

164
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,400
Where were you talking about?

165
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,080
We? We talked about you.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
I just told Chunsheng

167
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,680
you were a big hero

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
who brought back M101 Coordinate alone.

169
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Impressive!

170
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,480
Lei,

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,480
it's about your checkup time, isn't it?

172
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,400
I...

173
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh, that's right.

174
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,680
I... I should go.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
You've got a poor memory.

176
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,160
Come on.

177
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Be careful.

178
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm OK, I'm OK.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,640
I'll leave you all to chat.

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,240
Be careful.

181
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm OK.

182
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Lei, let me go with you.

183
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,720
OK.

184
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Hongling.

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
Come on. Be seated.

186
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
What did the doctor say?

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,360
You're not doing well, huh?

188
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Can you return to the army?

189
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,400
Don't be silly, girl.

190
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,760
The doctor said,

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm recovering very well.

192
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
It's true.

193
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
One minute before you got in,
the doctor just left.

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,120
She said I could return after recovery.

195
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,200
You're not lying?

196
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,680
When did I ever lie to you?

197
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Then promise me.

198
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,800
When we give a charity performance
to soldiers involved in the battle,

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
you have to walk there and watch it.

200
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Why are you crying? Fine.

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
I promise you.

202
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
When you give the charity performance,

203
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
I'll walk there, OK?

204
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,840
If you aren't satisfied,

205
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
I can even carry you there.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
What?

207
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
Why more tears?

208
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm all right, see?

209
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,240
Don't cry.

210
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Do you know how worried I was?

211
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,680
I even dreamed
that you couldn't come back.

212
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,160
I'm back and alive, aren't I?

213
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,600
But...

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,480
No buts.

215
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,480
Hongling,

216
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
I just promised you.

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,320
When you give the performance,

218
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I will have recovered.

219
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,200
Rest assured.

220
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
Look.

221
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
You look bad when crying.

222
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,280
Smile.

223
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,800
Lei.

224
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,560
Were you talking to Chunsheng
about M101 Coordinate?

225
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,720
Yes.

226
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,920
Then why did you criticize him?

227
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
I didn't.

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm just curious.

229
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
He always got full marks
in the demining training.

230
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,480
And why did he step on a mine there?

231
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
So weird.

232
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,800
What did Chunsheng say?

233
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
Before he could answer,

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,480
you disturbed us.

235
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,040
Look at Hongling.

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,120
She finally got some time to visit me,

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
but she didn't stay for a while.

238
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
Count your blessings.

239
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,480
The Art Troupe

240
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
has been giving performances everywhere.

241
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
It was hard for her

242
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
to spare some time

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
to visit you.

244
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,400
You made sense.

245
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,280
Chunsheng,

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
I have something to say.

247
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,840
I know what you're going to say.

248
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,400
About the hero thing, right?

249
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,720
Only the two of us know what happened.

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,600
Lift your foot.

251
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,360
Chunsheng.

252
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,560
I said lift your foot!

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Chunsheng.

254
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,640
The credit is yours.

255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,600
The honor belongs to you.

256
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
What's more,

257
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640
you saved my life.

258
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
I just want to tell you.

259
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Please don't get me wrong.

260
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,000
I never meant

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
to claim your credit.

262
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm going to tell our superiors

263
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
what exactly happened.

264
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,400
Stop.

265
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
Sit.

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,200
Sit!

267
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Ye Guohua, tell me.

268
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,360
Are we best buddies?

269
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,320
Yes, of course.

270
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
We're friends forever.

271
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Then listen to me.

272
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm all ears.

273
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
About the M101 Coordinate,

274
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,200
only you and I know.

275
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,920
I want no one else to be aware.

276
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,120
Why, Chunsheng?

277
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't bother.

278
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I have my own reason.

279
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,880
What reason?

280
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,160
Chunsheng,

281
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,920
take back the credit

282
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
and you'll be the hero.

283
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
After returning, you can be promoted.

284
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
Then you'll have a bright future.

285
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,840
Future?

286
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
Guohua, you know what?

287
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,400
Two pieces of shrapnel

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
are deep in my spine.

289
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,040
The diameter is

290
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,760
between 0.3mm and 5.5mm.

291
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,720
They are compressing

292
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,120
nearby nerves

293
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
so that I have backache

294
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
and leg dysfunction.

295
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,480
So serious?

296
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,520
Then, can you...

297
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,040
The doctor isn't sure, either.

298
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
If I want to recover,

299
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,000
I have to take an operation in Beijing.

300
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm familiar with hospitals
and doctors in Beijing.

301
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,560
I'll contact them for you.

302
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,120
The doctor also said,

303
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,560
nerves around the spine are complicated.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Even if a doctor in Beijing
operates on me,

305
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,360
the slightest lapse

306
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,320
can result in irreparable damage.

307
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,480
Guohua,

308
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,600
do you know what it means?

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,840
It means

310
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,680
I may not be a soldier anymore.

311
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,560
For the rest of my life,

312
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,280
I may not even stand up.

313
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,880
So,

314
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,640
being the hero

315
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,440
doesn't mean anything to me.

316
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,480
Guohua, listen to me.

317
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,760
The credit for getting the M101 Coordinate

318
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,080
belongs to you alone.

319
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Buddy,

320
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
you have to be the hero!

321
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,920
No, Chunsheng.

322
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,080
If I do this,

323
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,240
I'll feel sorry for you

324
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
for the rest of my life.

325
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
No, I can't do that.

326
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
Ye Guohua!

327
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm not doing this for you.

328
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,720
Then for what?

329
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,320
For our dreams!

330
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,680
Guohua,

331
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,120
do you remember?

332
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,960
Since childhood, we've dreamed

333
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,760
to be a general.

334
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,590
But now, only you can

335
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,920
realize this dream for me.

336
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,070
So, you have to be the hero.

337
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,240
Only in this way

338
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,240
can we get closer to our dream.

339
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,590
Ye Guohua,

340
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,440
remember.

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,200
Go realize our dream

342
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,840
for me!

343
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
(Knowing about his poor condition,)

344
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,240
(Xiao Chunsheng gave up being a hero.)

345
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
(However, the Party Organization)

346
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,480
(will never deprive a hero)

347
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,040
(who contributes
to his nation and people.)

(The glory belonging to Xiao Chunsheng)

349
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,600
(will get back to him in the near future.)

350
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
Chunsheng,

351
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,840
I get your point.

352
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,400
Don't worry.

353
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,800
I'll try my best

354
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,960
to get you back on your feet.

355
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Trust me.

356
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
I do.

357
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,460
(Serve the People)

(Develop art activities to consolidate
the socialist ideological front)

359
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,120
Commander,

360
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
the violinist

361
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
on the first row

362
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
is our concertmaster.

363
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,560
Her name is He Hongling.

364
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,760
She plays the best here.

365
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,480
The point is

366
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,760
soldiers like her performance.

367
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,600
How old is she?

368
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,520
21. Perfect age.

369
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,680
The percussion music can last longer.

370
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,600
Get her to me.

371
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,720
- OK.
- Let's try it again later.

372
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,480
Hongling, come over.

373
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,720
Greetings, Commander.

374
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,140
(Outpatient)

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,280
Chunsheng.

376
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,840
There you are, Hongling.

377
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,400
Here. Have an orange.

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Thanks.

379
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Chunsheng,

380
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
I have some good news to tell you.

381
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,040
What is it?

382
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
We can celebrate it for you.

383
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
This morning, a leader
from the Military Art Troupe

384
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,200
came to us.

385
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,160
He wanted me
to be part of the lecture tour.

386
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
Lecture tour?

387
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,120
What is that?

388
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
You don't know?

389
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
For heroes in the battle,

390
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
a lecture tour is arranged.

391
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
We'll give charity performances.

392
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,920
By the way,

393
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Guohua also won an honor

394
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,280
and was awarded.

395
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,160
He even got a medal for the hero.

396
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,840
Now, he's a real hero

397
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,120
and he'll be part of the lecture tour.

398
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,760
That's great.

399
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,360
Great, Hongling.

400
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
I really feel happy for you and Guohua.

401
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Chunsheng, when I'm on the tour,

402
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
I can't visit you for some days.

403
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Rest very well for the recovery

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,760
and try to stand up as soon as possible.

405
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
I will.

406
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
Two pieces of shrapnel

407
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,360
are deep in Chunsheng's spine,

408
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,160
so he has leg dysfunction.

409
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,360
Such an operation can't be done here.

410
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,960
He has to return soon to Beijing
for the operation.

411
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
And the operation is risky.

412
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,920
If it doesn't work out very well,

413
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,520
he can't return to the army

414
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,600
or even stand up.

415
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
At this moment,

416
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,960
he needs you around him.

417
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
You should be early prepared.

418
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,380
(Warmly Welcome Heroes' Lecture Group)

419
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
(At his first lecture, Ye Guohua was)

420
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,280
(shy and nervous.)

421
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,920
(When it comes to the demining part,)

422
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
(he was on pins and needles.)

423
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,360
Xiaomei,

424
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,040
thank you

425
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,800
for taking me out for a walk.

426
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,040
I want a walk, too.

427
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,720
Xiaomei, don't worry.

428
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,240
I won't be easily defeated like this.

429
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
I know.

430
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,200
You're Comrade Xiao Chunsheng.

431
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,960
Come on.

432
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Thank you, sir.

433
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
Sir, why did you give me an egg?

434
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
You're a hero.

435
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
And this is for your wife.

436
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
No, thanks.

437
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,400
Sir, she...

438
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,040
She isn't my wife.

439
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,240
Then she must be your girlfriend.

440
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
Fine. Thank you.

441
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
Thank you, sir.

442
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,560
You're welcome.

443
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,040
You fought in the battle to protect us

444
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,080
and got so badly wounded.

445
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
Some eggs are no big deal.

446
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,400
Young man, don't lose heart.

447
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
In the future,

448
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,040
live with your girlfriend.

449
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,800
I believe

450
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
you will get better soon.

451
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
Don't worry.

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
I will recover.

453
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,080
Glad to hear that.

454
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,720
Thank you, sir.

455
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,640
Enjoy your food.

456
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,200
OK.

457
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,160
Here, Dr. Tong.

458
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,120
Chunsheng.

459
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,800
Xiaomei, faster.

460
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,360
But...

461
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
Xiaomei, faster. Come on.

462
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,400
Xiaomei.

463
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,400
Guohua.

464
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,360
Hongling?

465
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,440
You're still awake so late?

466
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,240
I can't fall asleep.

467
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,960
Did you call Chunsheng today?

468
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,480
Yes, before I left this morning.

469
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,000
How's he getting?

470
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Do you know

471
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,520
about his condition?

472
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,960
Xiaomei told me a little.

473
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,960
Guohua,

474
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,240
can Xiao Chunsheng

475
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,040
really not stand up again?

476
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,440
Don't worry, Hongling.

477
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,440
I'll contact the best hospital
and the best doctors.

478
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,320
I'll have him cured at any cost!

479
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Hope he can get back on his feet.

480
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,680
He will.

481
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,320
Oh, Guohua,

482
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,520
why were you stammering

483
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
when you gave a speech?

484
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,880
You sounded very unconfident.

485
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Chunsheng

486
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,200
asked me not to tell
anyone else about something.

487
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,600
But you're not someone else, right?

488
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,200
I'm dying to say.

489
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,440
I have to tell you about this.

490
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
What is it?

491
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,680
That day,

492
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,760
I stepped on a landmine.

493
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
It was the enemy's territory

494
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
and I was doomed to die.

495
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,640
All I was thinking then was...

496
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Then Chunsheng turned up.

497
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I got my hope immediately.

498
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
He wanted to save me.

499
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
But how could it be that easy?

500
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
I know it's hard. So does he.

501
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,640
Instead of dying together,

502
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,080
I would rather die alone.

503
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
I asked him to leave,

504
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,920
but he just didn't.

505
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
Then I asked him,

506
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
"If we both die,

507
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,280
what will Hongling do?"

508
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,960
He didn't reply

509
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,840
but got down to the ground

510
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,960
to work on the landmine.

511
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
Even before I finished talking,

512
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
he pressed the spring,

513
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,760
asking me to lift my foot.

514
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
He had bloodshot eyes

515
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,320
as if he was crazy.

516
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,880
I didn't know why,

517
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
but I just lifted my foot.

518
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,520
Hongling,

519
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,680
I was ready to die, I promise.

520
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,200
I really didn't know

521
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,320
why I lifted my foot.

522
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
Now, every day,

523
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,400
I'm regretting it.

524
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
I regret not getting wounded

525
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
and I regret having my best buddy

526
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,840
suffer so much for me.

527
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
Guohua,

528
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,040
don't blame yourself.

529
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,160
I've been thinking recently.

530
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,760
Chunsheng isn't like other guys.

531
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,360
In the face of ideal and reality,

532
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,400
morality and benefit,

533
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,200
in the face of someone else's life
and his own life,

534
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,680
he seems

535
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
to always choose the former.

536
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
I've been trying to understand him

537
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,280
and I want to choose the same.

538
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,080
But I realize

539
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,680
that I can never be as good as him.

540
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,680
Fundamentally,

541
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,960
he's a hero.

542
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,880
But I am

543
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,600
an ordinary woman.

544
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
You're an ordinary man, too.

545
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,960
Hongling,

546
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
can you tell me

547
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,560
what I should do now?

548
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,640
Listen to Chunsheng

549
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
and go realize your common dream.

550
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
That's the biggest reward for him.

551
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,120
Hongling.

552
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,760
Ma'am.

553
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
Are you OK?

554
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,000
Yes.

555
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,920
You just visited Platoon Leader Ye, huh?

556
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,240
Yes. He's a very good friend of mine.

557
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,800
How's he now?

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,920
Maybe because it was his first speech

559
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,080
and he was too nervous.

560
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
I talked to him.

561
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
Now that you're friends,

562
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
take care of him.

563
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,160
To this lecture tour,

564
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,520
leaders are paying attention.

565
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Get back for some sleep.

566
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,360
And the operation is risky.

567
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,240
If it doesn't work very well,

568
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,000
he can't return to the army

569
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,200
or even stand up.

570
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,720
At this moment,

571
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,440
he needs you around him.

572
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,400
You should be early prepared.

573
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,400
Hongling,

574
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,280
you have to seize this chance.

575
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,880
Regimental Commander Tao
thinks highly of you.

576
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,680
If you do a great job during the tour,

577
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,520
he'll give special permission

578
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,920
to make you the leader of our orchestra.

579
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
Then you'll be a cadre.

580
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,960
(Meanwhile,)

581
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,920
(something happened)

582
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
(and disturbed Xiao Chunsheng.)

583
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,000
(There was often no reply
back in his home.)

584
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
(Questioned many times by him,)

585
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,360
(Xiao Yanqiu confessed)

586
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,920
(that their father was sick
in hospital again.)

587
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,440
(Even though she said it wasn't serious)

588
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,190
(and their father could
leave the hospital soon,)

589
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,400
(Xiao Chunsheng still felt uneasy.)

590
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,380
(Warmly Welcome Heroes' Lecture Group)

591
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,800
When the war just started,

592
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
my comrades-in-arms

593
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,230
went to the battlefield,

594
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,000
thinking

595
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,960
we could finally make contributions

596
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
to our nation and people.

597
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,560
I wasn't capable enough

598
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,960
to bring back all my comrades-in-arms.

599
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,720
I don't deserve the title

600
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,840
as the combat hero.

601
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
(After giving some speeches,)

602
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
(Ye Guohua was more familiar.)

603
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,840
(He finally got into it.)

604
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,520
(When excited, he had tears in his eyes
and sounded sonorous.)

605
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,760
(He gave better and better speeches.)

606
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,920
(The applause burst out
and everyone was moved.)

607
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,680
(He Hongling, who sometimes
sat in the auditorium)

608
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,800
(had mixed emotions.)

609
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,840
(Ye Guohua already made his choice.)

610
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
(What about her?)

611
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
(Outpatient)
Is the man who visited you

612
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,200
Ye Guohua, the combat hero?

613
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Did you take his temperature?

614
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,600
I'll give it to you.

615
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,720
Here.

616
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,120
Yes.

617
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,800
Ye Guohua is my platoon leader.

618
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,200
So, you were also in that battle, right?

619
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,120
Yes.

620
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,520
I was.

621
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Were you wounded then?

622
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
Did you make the record?

623
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,520
When he comes again,

624
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,560
may I have his autograph?

625
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,540
(Nurse Station)

626
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,480
Hello, Yanqiu.

627
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,520
Yanqiu.

628
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,520
Yanqiu, tell me the truth.

629
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
What happened to Dad?

630
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
He passed away.

631
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,280
On the 25th, last month,

632
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,880
our father died.

633
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
At dinner,

634
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,600
he... he was all right.

635
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,120
In the middle of the night,

636
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,480
I heard a thump.

637
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,320
When I got into his room,

638
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,640
he was on the ground.

639
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,840
Cerebral hemorrhage.

640
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,040
When he was sent to the hospital,

641
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,760
he couldn't be saved.

642
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,120
He was muttering your name.

643
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,080
Chunsheng,

644
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,840
he was muttering your name.

645
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,240
Commander.

646
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,080
Be seated, please.

647
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,520
How do you feel recently?

648
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,560
For your information, Commander,

649
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,960
I'm doing very well now.

650
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
This isn't a visitation.

651
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,920
I came to see if you're doing OK.

652
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,120
As for your recovery,

653
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,600
we have asked the doctor.

654
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,440
If...

655
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I mean if...

656
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,240
If the later treatment works out well,

657
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
we'll get you a clerical job.

658
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
And if...

659
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,080
If you want to be demobilized,

660
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,960
we'll also solve your problems

661
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,040
as far as we can.

662
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,360
Commander,

663
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,440
if possible,

664
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
I still want to return

665
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,760
as a soldier.

666
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,000
I understand your feelings.

667
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,560
But don't push yourself.

668
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,680
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

669
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
in life, there are many paths.

670
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,240
And every path has different scenery.

671
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,200
Remember.

672
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,920
When you put on this military uniform,

673
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,240
you can never take it off!

674
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,040
I heard about your father's death.

675
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,280
I'm sorry for your loss.

676
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,880
Throughout my father's life,

677
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,840
his only wish

678
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,440
was that I could be a soldier all my life.

679
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,040
But now,

680
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,160
I've failed him.
