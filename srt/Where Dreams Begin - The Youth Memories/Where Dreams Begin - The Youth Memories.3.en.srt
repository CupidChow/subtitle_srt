These are enough already.

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,180
No more dishes.

5
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,340
It's just a soup.

6
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,420
Mr. Liang,

7
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,540
forget it, it's just twenty cents' worth.

8
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,500
What are you saying?

9
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,100
You should be glad that there's meat.

10
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,540
Go get some hot water

11
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,740
and heat up the liquor.

12
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,300
It's a cold day, cold liquor
will hurt your stomach.

13
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,700
Luckily, you sent me
the message in advance

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,740
to stop me from taking weapons,

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,260
or we'd all be in jail now.

16
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,620
I just didn't want to make things worse.

Here it is.

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,180
Come on.

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,860
Alright.

21
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,940
Mr. Liang,

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,180
I saw the pictures and those certificates.

23
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,220
Back then,

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,740
you were pretty good.

25
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,980
That's in the past.

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,460
Don't mention it.

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,660
What should I say?

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,500
When it comes to martial arts,
it requires continual practice.

29
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,780
I haven't practiced for so many years.

30
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,860
I have forgotten them all already.

31
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Come on.

32
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,020

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,660
Thank you.

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,060
Chunsheng,

36
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,100
I'd like to propose a toast

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
to you.

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,140
I don't deserve it.

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,140
You do.

40
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,260
Just let me finish.

41
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,980
We didn't know each other before,

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,540
but I have heard about you.

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,380
I know you guys
from the military compound

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,020
are proud.

45
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,740
But after one of your brothers
got bullied,

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,380
you were generous enough to let it go

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,780
and did me a favor.

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,260
You turned hostility into friendship

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,620
and averted a group fight.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,100
Now,

51
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,660
on behalf of those alley boys,

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,820
I'll drink this first.

53
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,900
Come on.

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,580
Let's eat

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,180

Hello.

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,060
Give me a bottle of vinegar.

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,340
OK.

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,980
We have newly arrived Ox Tongue Pastry.

62

63
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,740
How much is it?

64
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,860
It's 1.7 yuan per catty.

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,700
Alright.

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,980
I'll take half a catty.

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,860
I don't have enough food coupons.

68
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,180
It's only enough for 0.4 catty.

69
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,140
Then 0.4 catty it is.

70
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,340
OK.

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,340
How is Mrs. Feng recently?

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,500
Not very stable.

73
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
It's been cold recently,

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,980
so she's not feeling too well.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,180
Oh.

You are in bed already?

81

OK.

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,180
Besides,

86
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,260
take a shower tomorrow

87

and get a haircut.

You haven't seen Xiaomei
for a long time.

89

Be sure to look good.

90
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,820
I have to get a haircut
before seeing Tong Xiaomei?

91
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
I got it.

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,420

I actually have a favor

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,900
to ask you.

104
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,620
Go on.

105
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,460
Alright, I'll say it then.

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,060
I want to learn some martial arts

107
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,340
from you.

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,260
You want to learn martial arts?

109
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,380
Yes.

110
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,020
But martial arts
require long-term practice.

111
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,060
It can't be mastered overnight.

112

Mr. Liang,

113
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,420
I really want to learn it

114
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,380
from you.

115
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
I know that

116
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,860
you think we compound boys

117
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,820
are impatient

118
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,900
and impetuous.

119
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,180
To tell you the truth,

120
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,700
my dream as a little boy

121
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,260
was to join the army

122
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,140
and defend our country.

123
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,460
Although I don't seem

124
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,740
to have the chance
to fulfill this dream now,

125
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,860
we need to think on the bright side.

126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,140
In case our country needs me one day,

127
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,740
I must be prepared, right?

128
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,220
Mr. Liang,

129
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,460
do not worry.

130
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,860
I mean it.

131
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,780
I really want to learn martial arts

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,980
from you

133
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,340
to prepare myself for it.

134
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,740
OK.

135
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,540
I trust you.

136
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,100
But

137
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,540
let me make it clear first.

138
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,060
Learning martial arts
requires you to be diligent.

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,860
If you slack off,

140
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,340
no matter how good our relationship is,

141
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,900
I'll punish you.

142
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,940
Don't blame me for being rude then.

143
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,820
Got it.

144
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,580
Good.

145
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,980
We are friends now.

146
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,660
Come on.

147
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,620

148
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,620
Come on.

149
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,220
Eat.

Hongling.

152
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,740
You've worked for quite a while.

153
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,100
Take a rest if you are tired.

154
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,180
I am not tired,

155
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,820
Mr. Liu.

156
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,980
Why are you not wearing gloves?

157
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,340
Look at your hands,
they are like carrots.

158
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
These mittens are inconvenient
to work with.

159
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,700
I can't hold the cabbage with them on.

160
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,900
Here.

161
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,900
Put on my work gloves.

162
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,940
They'll be of help,

163
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,060
and you can work with them on.

164
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,660
These work gloves are limited.

165
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,140
What are you gonna wear if I take yours?

166
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,500
Just take them.

167
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,060
Put them on now.

168
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,100
I have some extra ones.

169
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,100
OK.

170
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,300
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

171
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,660
As a beautiful girl,

172
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,340
you are doing such a hard job.

173
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
I feel sorry for you.

174
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,700
You know the situation of my family.

175
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,380
And you have been helping us
all these years.

176
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,060
You let me come to
the vegetable station every now and then

177
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,340
to earn some money
to supplement my family.

178
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,140
I really thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

179
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,300
Don't say that, Hongling.

180
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,660
I watched you grow up.

181
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,180
Now your dad is gone,

182
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,180
things are difficult for you

183
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,980
and your mom.

184
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,820
We old neighbors

185
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,100
can't help much.

186
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,060
We can only do our best.

187
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm going back to work, Mr. Liu.

188
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,060
(Ye Guohua never expected that)

189
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,700
(He Hongling, the proud princess,)

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,740
(had such a poor family.)

191
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,860
Hongling.

192
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Mr. Liang.

193
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,140
Coming.

194
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,140
Hongling, it's you.

195
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,420
The cabbages were sent
to the vegetable station today,

196
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,460
so I brought you some.

197
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,500
Tian. Tian.

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Come out and give me a hand.

199
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,820
Thanks a lot.

200
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,140
This is the money
for last time and this time.

201
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,420
What are you talking about?

202
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,020
How can I

203
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,180
take your money?

204
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,940
You must take it.

205
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,740
He Hongling lives around here.

206
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,740
Her father died

207
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,820
of illness.

208
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,220
And her mother has been in poor health

209
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,740
since then.

210
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,740
Since she was a teenager,

211
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,020
she did odd jobs out here.

212
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,500
In summer,
she sells popsicles on the street.

213
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,660
In winter,
she delivers cabbages and briquettes

214
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,340
for the whole street.

215
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,220
Mr. Liang pities her,

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,940
so he helps her from time to time.

217
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,740
And that's how

218
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,660
I got to know her.

219
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,220
I have known her for so many years.

220
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,220
I know her very well.

221
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,260
Her feelings

222
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,300
for me is at most

223
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,500
gratitude.

224
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,820
But look at the way she looked at you

225
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,180
and that young man.

226
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,740
It's totally different.

227
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
I've been out here for so many years,

228
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,180
I know about affections.

229
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,140
It can't be forced.

230
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
From now on,

231
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,860
the relationship among you
and her and Ye Guohua

232
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,980
is none of my business.

233
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't want to get involved.

234
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,660
Don't care about them.

235
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,580
Come on,

236
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,580
in this cold weather,

237
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
a bowl of hot soup

238
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
will make you feel the best.

239
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,220
Your hands.

240
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,860
They are OK.

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,180
Come on.

242
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,860
Sit down.

243
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,180
Goodbye.

244
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,580
Do you like me?

245
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,820
What?

246
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,500
Qi Tian told you everything, right?

247
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,220
Qi Tian and I
are not like what they say.

248
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,220
I know.

249
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,420
Mom, I'm home.

250
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,420
I brought you your favorite
Ox Tongue Pastry.

251
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,180
You shouldn't have wasted money on it.

252
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,860
Where did you go today?

253
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
The cabbages were sent
to the vegetable station,

254
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
so I went to deliver cabbages.

255
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,980
Do you feel better?

256
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,580
I'll heat your medicine up for you.

257
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,380
You did it yourself?

258
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,180
Someone came today.

259
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,740
Someone came?

260
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,740
Who's that?

261
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,220
He said he was your friend.

262
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,860
It's a boy surnamed Ye.

263
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,660
He was wearing a military uniform.

264
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,420
He's from the military compound, right?

265
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes.

266
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
We chatted for a while.

267
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,700
I think he's a good boy.

268
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,860
Dependable.

269
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,300
Now we are all brothers!

270
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:25,980
To brothers!

271
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,540
(After getting along for a while,)

272
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,860
(Xiao Chunsheng and Qi Tian
seemed to have become brothers.)

273
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,580
(Influenced by Xiao Chunsheng,
Heizi and the others)

274
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,060
(stopped fighting or making troubles.)

275
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,420
(No one would have thought that)

276
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,660
(two groups of people
with vastly different life experiences)

277
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,100
(would become close friends.)

278
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,220
(Relationship between
Xiao Chunsheng and He Hongling)

279
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,860
(also seemed to be changing quietly.)

280
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,300
(As the witness of all this,)

281
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,020
(Ye Guohua didn't feel too well.)

(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

284
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,660
Xiaomei,

285
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,380
have you thought about

286
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,300
serving as a soldier?

287
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,940
Your father wants you
to become an art soldier,

288
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,140
and I

289
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
agree with him.

290
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,140
I know that

291
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,300
you want to be a medic.

292
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,180
But they are not
recruiting any in recent years.

293
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,500
I remember when you were a little girl,

294
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
you liked playing the accordion.

295
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,740
Why don't you practice it and try?

296
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,620
Your dad wants to

297
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,660
invite your Uncle Xu over

298
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,540
to guide you in a few days.

299
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't like it anymore.

300
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
I just want to be a doctor now.

301
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,340
Have you inquired
about the conscription?

302
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,740
If you don't want to,

303
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,220
next time,

304
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,780
I'll ask Dad when I deliver the meal

305
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,260
to him,

306
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
and let him find someone to help.

307
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,060
I'm talking to you!

308
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
You'll make a great soldier.

309
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,700
I don't want our family
to drag you down.

310
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,820
Come on, Dad is not a drag,

311
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,940
he is a hero.

312
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,180
Besides, I'm still young.

313
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,060
I haven't figured many things out yet.

314
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,340
A few years later,

315
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,940
my time will come
when I master my skills well.

316
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,620
By the way,

317
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,580
I asked someone
to get some meat coupons.

318
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,820
Next time you go
to the military service,

319
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,460
buy some good meat
and make something good for Dad.

320
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,420
The meat was too tough

321
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
that he couldn't chew it well last time.

324
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,100
Yes, sir!

325
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,460
Guojiatun is here.

326
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,380
That's Chicheng,

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,980
which is to the southwest of Guojiatun.

328
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,300
It's just beyond the Great Wall.

329
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,900
How long does it take
to send our troops there?

330
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,900
From the Shanhai Pass?

331
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,980
That depends on when it is.

332
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,180
December 3, 1948,

333
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,300

of your Northeastern Field

336
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,460
was considered very high at that time.

337
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,300
But to finish this march,

338
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,620
it would still need a full day.

339
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,660
At that time?

340
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,660

Chahar, Jehol and Suiyuan

345
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,140
don't exist anymore.

346
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,260
Look,

347
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
both Chicheng and Shanhai Pass
belong to Hebei now.

348
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,580
And they have built new roads.

349
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,220
The Mechanized Rapid Response Force

350
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,860
of the People's Liberation Army

351
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,020
can reach the designated location

352
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,900
within four hours.

353
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,460
Dad.

354
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,740
It's time to eat.

355
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,420
Time to eat, Dad.

356
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,980
I brought your favorite braised pork.

357
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,500
Chunsheng.

358
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,100
Sit down, the food is getting cold.

359
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,820
Who did you think I was?

360
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,060
Officer Ye?

361
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,420
He's now Commissar Ye.

362
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,980
And he works
in Fuzhou Military Region now.

363
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,860
I guess he's also writing materials

364
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,540
like what you are doing now.

365
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,900
Stop, stop.

366
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,020
You need to

367
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,460
move your bow with your lower arm.

368
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,500
Look at what you are doing.

369
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,500
You didn't even master the basic skills.

370
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,660
He Hongling,

371
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
show them how.

372
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,620
She is not professional,

373
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,940
why should we learn from her?

374
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,460
Who does she think she is?

375
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,340
Dad, try it.

376
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,420
How about it?

377
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,340
Strong enough, huh?

378
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,180
Not bad.

379
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,140
This is the first batch liquor
I got from the Erguotou factory.

380
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,340
But Dad, listen,

381
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,700
this is a month's supply.

382
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,940
Don't finish it too quickly.

383
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,300
Comrade Xiao Yanpei,

384
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,780
did the organization
draw a conclusion about your matter?

385
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,020
I have no idea.

386
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,580
Have you finished
stating your past issues?

387
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,540
I haven't been asked
to write materials for some time.

388
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,660
Then do you have a deep understanding

389
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,900
about your own problems?

390
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,460
No.

391
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,380
No?

392
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,980
I am not guilty.

393
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
You are pretty arrogant.

394
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,340
What are your plans
for your future then?

395
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,260
I have no plan.

396
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
I'll work if they let me work,

397
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
and go home if they let me go home.

398
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,700
If I'm not allowed to do anything,

399
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,300
I'll just stay here.

400
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,580
Dad,

401
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,260
do you know
what I admire most about you?

402
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,940
It's your spirit.

403
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,540
One should never be

404
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,580
corrupted by wealth,

405
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,620
changed by poverty,

406
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,620
and bent by force.

407
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,380
Remember this.

408
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,020
I just feel sorry
for you and your sister.

409
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,740
Don't.

410
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,100
We are fine.

411
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,780
My sister is working in the factory now.

412
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,580
She's good.

413
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,060
Don't worry about us.

414
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,420
Maybe

415
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,180
I'll let her come next time.

416
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,540
You can't keep procrastinating
on being a soldier.

417
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,620
You've been doing
nothing serious all day.

418
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,700
That's not right.

419
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,460
Dad,

420
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,180
don't worry about it.

421
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,420
There will always be a way.

422
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,700
I am just like you.

423
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,100
Whatever.

424
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,420
Don't take those words to heart.

425
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,140
You're talented
and have a good foundation.

426
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,620
Don't waste it.

427
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,620
Ms. Chen,

428
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,700
is there any change in the enrollment policy
of the orchestra this year?

429
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,500
They'll still only recruit
from workers, peasants and soldiers.

430
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,300
Hello, Ms. Chen.

431
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,540
We made some meat today,

432
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,980
I'll bring you some later.

433
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,540
You are being clever again?

434
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,900
What are you thinking about?

435
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,860
I don't accept benefits for nothing.

436
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,620
What are you talking about?

437
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,140
You watched me grow up,

438
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,660
of course I should respect you.

439
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,900
You sounded like
I wanted something from you.

440
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,060
Stop beating around the bush.

441
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,100
Hongling

442
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,580
is in your class now.

443
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,860
I just want you to take care of her.

444
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,740
I knew you had some intentions.

445
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,380
Well...

446
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,060
Mrs. Liu at the entrance of our alley

447
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,100
wants to set you up
on another blind date.

448
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,260
That man is over 1.8 meters.

449
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
She said she was going to

450
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,660
talk to you about it.

451
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,420
Don't talk to Ms. Chen like that.

452
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
OK, no problem.

453
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,180
I have to go.

454
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,140
Goodbye, Ms. Chen.

455
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,420
The Red Women's Army will be on

456
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,540
at Workers' Club tomorrow night.

457
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,660
Let's watch it.

458
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,580
You asked me about it last time.

459
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,060
I specially asked Heizi
to get the tickets.

460
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,020
Listen,

461
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
do not be discouraged.

462
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,260
Sooner or later,
your father's matter will be clarified.

463
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,820
At that time, you can also take the test.

464
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,460
Maybe you can be a soldier

465
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,460
or even join the art troupe.

466
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,820
(Long live our great,
glorious, and correct Party)

467
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,060
Who's it?

468
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,140
Chunsheng? Why are you here?

469
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,180
Come on in.

470
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,180
Why did you come here
so early in the morning?

471
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,900
I brought you some hand cream.

472
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,100
The last time I saw you,
there were frostbites on your hands.

473
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,300
Apply this

474
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,180
and it'll get better soon.

475
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,940
Here.

476
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,500
Thank you.

477
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,980
Sit down, please.

478
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,820
I'll pour you some hot water.

479
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,300
(Violin Scale Tutorial)

480
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,700
Hongling,

481
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,300
you have so many violin music sheets.

482
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,020
I've practiced violin since childhood,

483
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,980
my dad bought them for me.

484
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,540
You rode all the way from the west,

485
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,420
you must be very cold.

486
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,580
Come on.

487
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,300
Have some hot water

488
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,020
and warm yourself up.

489
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,980
Thank you.

490
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,340
This hand cream is not easy to buy.

491
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,500
I went to the department store
several times and didn't get it.

492
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
You should have told me earlier.

493
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,260
There is a lot in the military service
in our compound.

494
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,260
I'll

495
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,500
bring you more next time.

496
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,500
No need.

497
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,980
This will be enough for quite a while.

498
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,100
Hongling,

499
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,700
Mr. Liang told me that

500
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,500
your father was a professor
at the conservatory,

501
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,300
and your mother
was also a teacher there.

502
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,620
So you're from a musical family?

503
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,460
My dad was my grandfather's student.

504
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,140
My mother's parents were all musicians.

505
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,140
That's good.

506
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,260
I like music too.

507
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,940
I see there's a violin on your desk.

508
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,820
You can play the violin
since you were young?

509
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,740
Yes.

510
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,300
My grandma was

511
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,940
a violinist.

512
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,340
She started to teach me
when I was little.

513
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,540
Can you play something?

514
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,780
I want to hear it.

515
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,420
No way.

516
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,820
I only get a chance to play it

517
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,940
on music classes now.

518
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,300
I dare not play it

519
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,580
at home at all.

520
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,500
You know the situation of our family.

521
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,740
If those people

522
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,180
from the Revolutionary Committee hear it

523
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,540
and accuse me
of trying to restore the bourgeoisie,

524
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,180
my mother will suffer again.

525
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,500
Do you want to play it?

526
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,140
Of course I do.

527
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,580
That's why I take music classes.

528
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,460
I can give them a demonstration
from time to time.

529
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,180
I don't dare play it now.

530
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,060
Wait for me.

531
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,500
Don't go anywhere.

532
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,620
Where are you going?

533
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,860
Just wait for me.

534
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,460
This boy

535
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,180
is always reckless.

536
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,860
Hongling,

537
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
get dressed quickly.

538
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,220
Put on as many clothes as you can.

539
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,940
Take the violin and come with me.

540
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,740
What are you doing?

541
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,660
Don't ask.

542
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
You will know soon.

543
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,180
Put on some more layers.

544
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,980
- Hurry up.
- OK.

545
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll wait for you at the door.

546
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,020
You've finally come.

547
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,140
A motorbike?

548
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,740
Come on. Hop on!

549
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,980
Where did you get it, Chunsheng?

550
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,980
I borrowed this from the compound.

551
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,380
I'll take you out for a drive.

552
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Sit tight.

553
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,060
Let's go!

554
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,820
Come on.

555
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,180
Hongling, are you tired?

556
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,980
No.

557
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,460
The sky is high,

558
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,180
wild geese are flying south.

559
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,140
You must come to the Great Wall
to become a true hero.

560
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,980
Ten thousand kilometers
are behind me now.

561
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,420
On the highest peak of Liupan Mountain,

562
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,420
the red flags are flying in the west wind.

563
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,380
With the long spear in my hand,

564
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,140
when will I catch the black dragon?

565
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,020
Great!

566
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,100
Great!

567
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,780
Great!

568
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,140
Hongling.

569
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,060
Hongling.

570
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,540
Come on.

571
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,860
Play the violin.

572
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,460
Do not worry.

573
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,660
At this place,

574
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,140
nobody will stop you from doing it.

575
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,140
And no one will bother you.

576
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,740
Just feel free to play it

577
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
as long as you want.

578
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,700
Come on.

579
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,180
Play it.

580
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,460
(At first, Xiao Chunsheng
was attracted by He Hongling)

581
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,260
(because of her beauty and character,)

582
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,620
(but at this time, he was even more)

583
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,580
(impressed by her temperament)

584
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,500
(and talent.)

585
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,540
(Unknowingly,)

586
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,180
(he fell for this)

587
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,460
(stubborn, proud and fragile girl.)

588
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
I haven't played for a long time.

589
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm a bit unfamiliar with it.

590
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,540
Are you intoxicated by it?

591
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,780
Hongling, that was great.

592
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,700
Your music is almost
as beautiful as you.

593
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,020
What are you talking about?

594
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm telling the truth.

595
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,380
Have you heard this piece of music?

596
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,780
Never.

597
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,460
But

598
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,980
I felt enthusiasm

599
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,860
and freedom in it.

600
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,300
Not bad, Xiao Chunsheng,

601
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,820
you are pretty sensitive.

602
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,780
Not bad at all.

603
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,860
I was right?

604
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,740
This piece is called Csárdás.

605
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,260
It is a masterpiece

606
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,340
by Monti,
a famous Italian violin composer.

607
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,140
Hongling,

608
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,780
I'll play something for you too.

609
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,740
Sit down.

610
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,620
OK.

611
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,660
Hongling, it's cold today.

612
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,380
You must be tired.

613
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,220
Get in to warm yourself up now.

614
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,740
Goodbye then.

615
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,020
Here.

616
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,780
(Quotations from Chairman Mao
The people are the motive force of world history)

617
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,700
Chunsheng,

618
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,980
today is the happiest day
I've had in a while.

619
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,380
Thank you.

620
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,260
Me too.

621
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,140
It's getting late, go home.

622
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,140
See you around.

623
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,500
See you.

624
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,700
Why are you here?

625
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
I'm going to the cinema.

626
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,060
So I'm...

627
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Shengli Cinema?

628
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,940
Yes.

629
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
I'll treat you to a movie
some other day.

630
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,980
♪You are like a spring breeze♪

631
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,780
♪Blown into my heart♪

632
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,100
What's this?

633
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,540
It's a pop song.
You've never heard it, right?

634
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,580
♪You are the only thing I see♪

635
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,940
♪Like the beautiful dream of youth♪

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,940
♪I want to stay with you forever♪

637
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,460
(August 1st)

638
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,340
Hongjun, good for you.

639
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,420
You are almost as good as your dad.

640
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,220
My skills

641
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,460
are far inferior to my dad's.

642
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,420
Take a break

643
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,180
and play cards with them.

644
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,780
Thank you.

645
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,220
But I have to go back

646
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,020
after fixing this.

647
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,540
I haven't finished the book

648
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
Fang brought me.

649
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,700
Two aces.

650
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,700
Pass.

651
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,820
Take this.

652
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,700
No.

653
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,780
Fix your glasses,

654
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,340
or get a new pair.

655
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,740
The adhesive plaster doesn't look good.

656
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
It's OK.

657
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,860
I can still use them.

658
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,660
Maybe it's OK for you,

659
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,460
but what if Ye Fang's mother sees it?

660
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,900
Yanqiu, Hongjun.

661
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,180
Guohua, it's you.

662
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,700
Guohua.

663
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,500
Guohua.

664
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:00,820
Just take it.

665
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,700
We haven't seen you for days.

666
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,220
- Where have you been these days?
- I'll cook.

667
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,140
You didn't even come to play cards.

668
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,100
Isn't it obvious?

669
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,940
Of course he was with He Hongling.

670
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,900
Cut it out.

671
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,020
Don't talk nonsense.

672
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,380
Guohua,

673
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,740
you still haven't taken her down?

674
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,700
Shut up.

675
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,660
Where is Chunsheng?

676
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,460
He went out early in the morning.

677
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,260
I don't know where he is.

678
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:18,940
He went out?

679
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,460
Let me do it.

680
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,700
What are you doing here?

681
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,300
I went to your home for you,

682
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
your next door neighbor said

683
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
you were working here,

684
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,420
so I came.

685
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,940
This is not your job.

686
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,100
It's OK. I'll do it.

687
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,460
If you can do it, I can do it.

688
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,460
You step aside
and rest for a while, let me do it.

689
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,140
Chunsheng, have some hot water.

690
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,820
Nice cup.

691
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,100
Give it to me.

692
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,260
You have worked all morning.

693
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,340
You must stay to have lunch.

694
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,340
I think I'll pass.

695
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,140
I still have to...

696
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,540
Guohua?

697
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,580
Hongling.

698
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,380
I brought some briquettes for you.

699
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,340
Thank you.

700
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,300
Guohua.

701
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,260
Chunsheng.

702
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,540
Mrs. He.

703
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,300
Guohua,

704
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,580
you brought us something again?

705
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,140
Some briquettes
were sent to my house today,

706
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,620
and you ran out of it

707
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,060
the last time I came.

708
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,540
So I just brought some for you.

709
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,940
You have already

710
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,780
sent a lot of things to our house.

711
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,220
Just some small stuff.

712
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,660
Don't worry about it.

713
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,340
Don't worry.

714
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
This is...

715
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
Xiao Chunsheng, he is...

716
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,460
Mrs. He, I am Guohua's friend.

717
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,700
Actually, Guohua sent me here today.

718
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,820
Sit down, please.

719
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,300
You must stay for lunch.

720
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,340
No, Mrs. He,

721
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,940
now that Guohua has come,

722
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,900
I can rest assured.

723
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,740
I have something to deal with at noon.

724
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,900
I won't stay for lunch.

725
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,340
You are leaving already?

726
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,340
Mrs. He.

727
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,220
Goodbye then.

728
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,780
You take your time.

729
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,380
Goodbye, Mrs. He.

730
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,220
Goodbye.

731
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,540
Go see him off.

732
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,660
I want to skate tomorrow.

733
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,980
Who is it?

734
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,780
It's me, Ma'am.

735
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,300
I am Ye Fang, Guohua's little sister.

736
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,620
Is Hongjun at home?

737
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,340
No wonder you look familiar.

738
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,460
You are Ye Fang.

739
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,140
Look at you.

740
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,140
You look good in this uniform.

741
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,780
Hongjun is in the back room.

742
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,140
Hongjun.

743
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,380
Mom!

744
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,460
Ye Fang.

745
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,500
Why are you here?

746
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Aren't you in the army?

747
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,060
I'm back in Beijing for business.

748
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,140
I'll stay at home for several days.

749
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,860
What's the matter?

750
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,380
What are you laughing at?

751
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,620
It's the first time
I've seen you without glasses.

752
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,260
Well, my glasses are broken.

753
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,900
Let me see.

754
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,940
Its leg's broken.

755
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,540
This frame can't be repaired,
you can only get a new one.

756
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,620
Yes. I just haven't had time.

757
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,620
The last time I saw you,

758
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,100
there was adhesive plaster on it.

759
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,380
I just wanted to make do with it.

760
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,580
Let me fix it for you. Give me.

761
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,860
You seem to be dexterous.

762
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,220
I've been trained

763
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,540
to tear off the adhesive tape
and dress the wound.

764
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,820
Every girl in the military can do it.

765
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,860
Really?

766
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,860
Try it on.
