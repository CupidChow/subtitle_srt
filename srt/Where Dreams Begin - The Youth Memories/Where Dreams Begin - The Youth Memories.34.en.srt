3
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,000
I am.

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm the most selfish!

5
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,520
Satisfied?

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,240
But who am I being selfish for?

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,680
For you,

8
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,760
and our family!

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,360
I know

10
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,520
I, Chen Hongjun,
don't have a good background.

11
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm not good enough for you,

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,760
let alone your noble family.

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
But what can I do about it?

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,840
What can I do?

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,520
Have you thought about me?

16
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
What can I do?

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
I can only rely on myself

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,120
to climb up step by step.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,800
That's the only way I can
stop your father's old subordinates

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
from pointing fingers at me.

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,800
Hongjun,

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,190
you are wrong.

23
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,800
You are ridiculously wrong.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,480
Enough, Ye Fang,

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
I don't want to
hear your lecture anymore.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,040
Save your breath.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,880
I repeat.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
I, Chen Hongjun,

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,240
am your husband, not your son.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
Since you like to give lectures so much,

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
why don't you give birth
to a child and lecture him?

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,360
(Chen Hongjun finally
expressed the dissatisfaction)

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,880
(suppressed in his heart to Ye Fang.)

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,480
(But he suddenly felt at a loss.)

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,640
(When he was depressed before,)

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,960
(he would go to Xiao Chunsheng.)

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,720
(Xinhua Bookstore
Good books promote cultural development)

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,600
(But he had been estranged
from Chunsheng now.)

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,600
Gu Lin.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
Chunsheng is quite capable.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
He has built his equipment factory

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
and received a lot of orders.

43
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
I met a nurse

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,520
from our hospital's rehab center.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,080
She praised Chunsheng,

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
saying he is reliable.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,680
Speaking of which,

48
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,160
I did some serious research

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
on his medical devices not long ago.

50
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
He is both smart

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
and kind.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,840
I knew long ago

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
that he would be a great businessman,

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,720
but I didn't expect him

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
to deal with medical equipment.

56
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,520
Xiaomei is a rehabilitation doctor.

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,040
They can help each other.

58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,160
They are a good match.

59
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,070
Yes.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
I can sense

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
his sincerity.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,840
So you'll accept him as your son-in-law?

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Of course.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,760
I accepted him long ago.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,840
But

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Xiaomei is my only daughter.

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
I want her to stay with me for longer.

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't want her to leave me now.

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
But it's time for her to get married.

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,720
You don't know,

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Qin next door also likes Chunsheng,

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
and wants him to be his son-in-law.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,840
What did you say?

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Qin wants Chunsheng to...

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,080
Dream on! How dare he!

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm going to...

77
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
Just sit down.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Calm down now.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
You think Chunsheng
can be taken away easily?

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,120
Of course not.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,120
Hey,

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
how about this?

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,120
Let's choose a good day

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,120
and let them get married.

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,480
You sound like it's easy.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,120
We should get Xiaomei's consent first.

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,480
Of course.

Good girl.

94
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,440
It's nice!

95
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
Good.

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,760
Xiaomei,

98
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,200
I am very happy today.

99
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Me too.

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,280

I have made the appointment.

111
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,440
Chunxiao Health Care?

112
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,520
Yes.

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,520
I know what you mean.

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Indeed,

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
Li Shangyou has done a good job
in recent years.

116
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,960
But I did my research.

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,560
In the field of medical devices,

118
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Chunxiao is still the best in the north.

119
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
I think you should reconsider it.

120
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,360
This is the first order

121
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
of our export business.

122
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,680
It doesn't matter
whether we make money or not,

123
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,800
but the quality must meet the standard.

124
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
But Li Shangyou

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
is striving hard for it.

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,480
I know.

127
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,360
So maybe we should meet them first,

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,520
and then let's see what to do next.

129
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,880
What do you think?

130
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,360
Why does Chunxiao Health Care
sound so familiar?

131
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,680
OK, let's do it then.

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
This matter must be kept secret.

133
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
The less people know it, the better.

134
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Of course.

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,600
When will we meet them?

136
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Tomorrow evening.

137
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,960
Still at that restaurant.

138
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,000
OK, I got it.

139
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,880
I just called your home,

140
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,840
why did no one answer it?

141
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,800
You are not at home?

142
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
I'm not.

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm having a chat with a friend.

144
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,440
What about Ye Fang?

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,360
She's also not home

146
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,480
so late at night?

147
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,040
No.

148
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,160
A friend of hers
is having a birthday party.

149
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,840
She said she would come home late.

150
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,760
OK.

151
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,760
What's wrong?

152
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Nothing.

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,480
See you.

154
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,680
What are you cooking?

155
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Mom brought new herbal medicine.

156
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,600
No wonder

157
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
it smells so bad.

158
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,160
So many years have passed,

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't think you'll get pregnant again.

160
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Just give up.

161
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,920
You don't know.

162
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
I don't like the smell.

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,840
Stop cooking it.

164
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
If Mom brings some here again,

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
just throw it away.

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,240
It's too late to regret now.

167
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
Neither of us knew she was pregnant,

168
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
or I would protect her well,

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,960
and not let her suffer like this.

170
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
That's not right.

171
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
Before the abortion,

172
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,720
she said she took folic acid.

173
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
So I think she knew she was pregnant.

174
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,720
You knew it already?

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Right?

176
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Why?

177
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,360
Xiaomei,

178
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to meet somebody.

179
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,400
Do you want me to go with you?

180
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,200
No.

181
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
It's an old friend.

182
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
I know.

183
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,320
I have seen your schedule.

184
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,800
But I don't think he knows

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,720
I am the person
in charge of Chunxiao Health Care.

186
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,240
Back then, it was him

187
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
who led me to this industry.

188
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,960
I wanted to find a chance
to thank him in person,

189
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,800
but I realized that

190
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,920
he was avoiding me on purpose.

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,840
Not to mention Guohua,

192
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,960
I even learned about his retirement

193
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
from somebody else.

194
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,000
Lives are getting better and better,

195
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
but why are we estranged

196
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
from each other?

197
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,520
You want to ask me

198
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,120
if they would like to see you

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
and

200
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
if you should meet them?

201
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,840
In fact, you already
have the answer in your heart.

202
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,920
You just want it
to come out of my mouth,

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,520
so you'll feel more at ease.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Am I right?

205
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,520
Xiaomei,

206
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,800
you know everything

207
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,440
on my mind.

208
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,280
If you ask me,

209
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,040
of course they don't want to see you,

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,880
but you still have to meet them.

211
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,840
Why?

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,680
Chunsheng,

213
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
after so many years,

214
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,360
you are now mature and experienced,

215
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,400
but one thing has never changed.

216
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,120
Do you know what it is?

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,880
As long as
you see some people as your friends,

218
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,880
they'll always be your friends.

219
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,560
You'll even see them

220
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,440
as your siblings.

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,360
You'll care about them.

222
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,440
And no matter how much they hurt you,

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
you don't take that to heart at all.

224
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,520
But if they do you
even the smallest favor,

225
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
you'll never forget it.

226
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,320
After all,

227
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,680
you still see them as your brothers.

228
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Isn't it too much
for an old couple like us?

229
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
So what?

230
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
I'll hold your hand forever.

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
Secretary Li,

232
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,720
put the information
of the European customers

233
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,840
on my desk tomorrow morning.

234
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,720
Yes.

235
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,280
Check the exact time
of their arrival in China.

236
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Yes. I'm going to pick them up myself.

237
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,560
OK.

238
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
What breakfast do you want tomorrow?

239
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,160
Whatever.

240
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,280
(Basics of Economics)
Just make it early.

241
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
I have a meeting in the morning.

242
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,800
And don't wait for me for dinner
tomorrow night.

243
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,800
I'll eat outside.

244
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,830
OK.

245
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,880
Guohua,

246
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,080
your strategy is right.

247
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,040
Competition in the domestic
medical device business

248
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,280
is becoming increasingly fierce.

249
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
It's time

250
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
to turn our attention
to overseas markets.

251
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,120
It's such a dramatic change.

252
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,760
Some ten years ago,

253
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
we had to import medical devices,

254
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,520
but now,

255
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
we are exporting them.

256
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,760
Yeah, it's really unexpected.

257
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,960
Hongjun,

258
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,480
through this order,

259
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
I found that the overseas demand

260
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,040
is very big.

261
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,240
If we do this well,

262
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,280
we'll definitely make a lot of money.

263
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
This is the first step for Huasheng
to develop overseas markets.

264
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,040
We must find a reliable supplier.

265
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,440
It's not convenient for me

266
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
to show up at this bidding.

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
You'll have to do that again.

268
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
It's OK. I understand.

269
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,400
This way, sir.

270
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,800
Long time no see.

271
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,120
Chunsheng?

272
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,320
Don't tell me

273
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
you are the boss
of Chunxiao Health Care!

274
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,720
That's right.

275
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm the representative
of Chunxiao Health Care.

276
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,560
Then I guess

277
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,840
I should call you President Xiao.

278
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,400
I still hope you call me Chunsheng.

279
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,200
Guohua.

280
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,840
Come on.

281
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,520
Well...

282
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,080
Take a seat. Take a seat.

283
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,880
Please sit down.

284
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,640
Hey, Miss.

285
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,600
You can serve the dishes now.

286
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,240
OK.

287
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,080
Chunsheng.

288
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
You made such a great achievement.

289
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,520
Your business is booming.

290
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,000
I've heard a lot about Chunxiao.

291
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Is Chunxiao

292
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
named after you and Xiaomei?

293
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,080
Yes.

294
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,240
Chunxiao,

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,560
Chunsheng and Xiaomei.

296
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,480
This is smart.

297
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,800
It's a good name with a good implication.

298
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Isn't it, Guohua?

299
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,800
Chunsheng.

300
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,160
I ordered a lot of

301
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,280
their specialties here.

302
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,360
They are all nice.

303
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,280
You can try them later.

304
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Hongjun,

305
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,080
you don't need to treat me like a client.

306
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,400
I'm not used to such luxurious stuff.

307
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,840
Why don't we

308
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,400
go to the restaurant we used to go a lot?

309
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,560
Let's catch up.

310
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,120
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

311
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,920
Come on, eat.

312
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,120
Try it.

313
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,120
Back then,

314
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,480
we could skate at Shichahai Ice Rink

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,560
almost a whole day.

316
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
When we were shivering with cold,

317
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,640
this hotpot would warm us up.

318
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,400
Do you remember?

319
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
The two of us

320
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,960
would pay for you.

321
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
That's only fair.

322
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
Why did I go there?

323
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,680
To be a foil of you two

324
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,400
and help you attract girls' attention.

325
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
Come on, Hongjun.

326
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,000
Try the mutton.

327
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,320
See if it reminds you of the past.

328
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Come on, Guohua.

329
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,520
Try it.

330
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Hong, two more plates of mutton, please.

331
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,960
Your mutton's coming.

332
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,760
I'll take it.

333
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
How does it taste, Boss?

334
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,960
It's nice.

335
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,240
Thank you.

336
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,080
Just tell me
if you want to eat anything.

337
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,400
Dinner is on Mr. Xiao tonight.

338
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,120
That's right.

339
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,960
Just order whatever you want.

340
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
It's on me.

341
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,080
Come on.

342
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
OK. Please enjoy.

343
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,080
Chunsheng,

344
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
is she Xia Ming's...

345
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,160
Where is Xia Ming?

346
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,720
He passed away last year.

347
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,160
Cancer.

348
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,240
You still come here a lot?

349
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,360
This restaurant is mine now.

350
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
I didn't spend a lot of money.

351
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
And I didn't do it for money.

352
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,920
It's just a memento.

353
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,240
Come on.

354
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,560
Time has been going so fast

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
like it's pushing us forward.

356
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,120
A lot of things back then

357
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
are already gone.

358
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,480
Not much thing

359
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,840
has left.

360
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,080
Look at me.

361
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm really old now.

362
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,920
What am I talking about?

363
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,360
Come on.

364
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,360
Cheers.

365
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,080
Cheers.

366
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
What's wrong?

367
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,520
Why are you laughing?

368
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,800
Hongjun, your drinking capacity

369
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
is bigger, huh?

370
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,680
Not only that,

371
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,880
my belly is also bigger.

372
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
The higher the position you are at,

373
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,280
the more social engagements you have.

374
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,000
But Chunsheng,

375
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,720
you haven't changed at all.

376
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,680
Come on. Try the mutton.

377
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,200
The taste hasn't changed at all.

378
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,720
Really? Why do I feel like it's changed?

379
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,720
Has it? I don't think so.

380
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,840
It's indeed different from before.

381
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
Hong thought the taste of the past

382
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
can't keep up with
the changes of the times,

383
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
so she made some improvements.

384
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,640
Improvements, huh?

385
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
The taste of the past
will never come back again.

386
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,960
Hongjun,

387
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,200
I entered this industry
because you took me

388
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
to that medical equipment market.

389
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
I wanted to thank you in person

390
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
but did not find a chance.

391
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
Now the chance has come.

392
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
I have to thank you in person.

393
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,440
Come on.

394
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,160
Well, I...

395
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,560
Let me.

396
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,440
No, let me do it.

397
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,480
What are you doing?

398
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,520
We are brothers, don't say that.

399
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,040
Cheers.

400
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,800
Let me do it.

401
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,960
Guohua,

402
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,560
I haven't heard from you
since you left the army.

403
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,960
How did you start to do business

404
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,240
together with Hongjun?

405
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,560
No.

406
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Chunsheng,

407
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,680
you misunderstood.

408
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,440
I can't do business

409
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,960
because of my post.

410
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm just trying

411
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,640
to give Guohua some advice

412
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,040
as a friend.

413
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,400
I heard that

414
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,280
Huasheng is already the largest

415
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,320
medical device dealer in the country.

416
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
I didn't expect

417
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,160
we would be in the same area

418
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,600
at last.

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,320
In the future,

420
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,480
we can fight side by side again.

421
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,840
That's right.

422
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,880
I didn't expect this either.

423
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,240
Let's not talk about work today.

424
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,200
Let's drink.

425
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,120
That's right.

426
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,680
Let's drink.

427
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
Back then, Chunsheng,

428
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,760
that fight between you and Qi Tian

429
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,480
made such a big noise.

430
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
All the hooligans in Beijing

431
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,880
heard about it.

432
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,280
I remember that

433
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,960
we were surrounded by police, right?

434
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,280
But I really didn't expect that

435
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
you two would make peace at last.

436
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,760
So many people thought

437
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,480
you would turn against each other

438
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,880
or even try to kill each other.

439
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
Time really flies.

440
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,600
Who would have thought

441
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,040
that Qi Tian

442
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,920
would be the person
who achieved something

443
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,760
with you?

444
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
Sometimes,

445
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
life is really amazing.

446
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,360
Take me and Xiaomei for example,

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,160
when we hung out together,

448
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,280
who would have thought Tong Xiaomei

449
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,520
would become my wife?

450
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,120
After so many ups and downs,

451
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,840
it's still her in the end.

452
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,880
Hongjun,

453
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,080
how are you and Ye Fang?

454
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,720
We are still the same.

455
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
Don't you plan to have a baby?

456
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,080
You know Ye Fang so well.

457
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,720
Let's not talk about her.

458
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,160
Her character hasn't changed at all.

459
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
She's still that dominant.

460
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,160
Come on.

461
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,960
Fill it up.

462
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,360
Guohua, how old is your child now?

463
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,320
We almost had one, but lost it at last.

464
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,880
It's okay, you're still young.

465
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,600
I'll ask Xiaomei to introduce

466
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,840
a good herbalist doctor to you.

467
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,600
I think that will help.

468
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,200
Don't bother, I don't like
the smell of herbal medicine.

469
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,640
All right.

470
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Let's not talk
about those unhappy things.

471
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,240
Let's just drink, OK?

472
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,000
Come on.

473
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,320
Cheers.

474
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,960
Be careful.

475
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,160
Be careful, Hongjun.

476
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,160
(Hotpot Restaurant)

477
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,200
- Well...
- Where is your car?

478
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,240
It's over there.

479
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,920
- Chunsheng.
- Here.

480
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,120
Guohua, time to say goodbye.

481
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,160
Alright. Alright.

482
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,160
Hold him.

483
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,000
Don't let him fall.

484
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,560
Guohua.

485
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,560
Get in my car and I'll give you a ride.

486
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,160
Don't bother.

487
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,520
My car is here too.

488
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,040
You have gray hair already.

489
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,360
Actually, I didn't sleep well last night

490
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,280
because I knew I would meet you today.

491
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,480
My mind was full of memories
from our childhood.

492
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,000
It was like yesterday.

493
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,760
I just couldn't

494
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,040
remember one thing.

495
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,440
How old were you

496
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,600
when we first met?

497
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,280
I was ten.

498
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,280
Ten.

499
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Look,

500
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
you have a better memory.

501
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,480
You were ten,

502
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,720
so I was eleven.

503
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,560
Let me think. Yes.

504
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,440
It was 1968.

505
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,960
That's right.

506
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,600
Chairman Mao called on educated youth
to go to the countryside.

507
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,920
At the start of the next year,

508
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,200
elder kids were all gone.

509
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
Even the streets felt emptier.

510
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,040
We rode a big bicycle

511
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,040
in a strange posture all day

512
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,400
due to our short legs.

513
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
In the end, that bike

514
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,640
was smashed by someone we fought with.

515
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,280
That's right.

516
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,240
Later, I often asked myself

517
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,760
how our relationship

518
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,520
became like this.

519
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,600
Chunsheng,

520
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
I also thought about contacting you.

521
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,360
And then?

522
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,480
I didn't.

523
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,640
I also asked myself the same question.

524
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,040
How did our relationship

525
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,040
become like this?

526
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,520
Half past ten next Monday,

527
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,160
Chunxiao Company.

528
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,560
The time and place
will not change, right?

529
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,800
That's right.

530
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,680
We are friends,

531
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,560
but business is business.

532
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,040
I won't be partial to Chunxiao
in the bidding.

533
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,640
Of course.

534
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,240
Guohua,

535
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Hongjun's at a high position.

536
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
He'll fall hard if anything goes wrong.

537
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,320
I know you are relatives

538
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,720
and friends,

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,800
but don't drag him

540
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,160
in your business.

541
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,120
See you.

542
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,880
Wait, why did you take this out?

543
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,840
The violin case was covered in dust,

544
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
so I cleaned it.

545
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,840
Forget it. Leave me alone, please.

546
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,880
I agree with your marriage with Guohua.

547
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,710
Now that you are a wife,

548
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,920
you should act like one.

549
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,840
You and Guohua were young

550
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,960
before.

551
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,480
So we didn't give you

552
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,600
a lot of pressure.

553
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,080
But now you are

554
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,480
old enough to be parents,

555
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,720
you should have
a sense of responsibility.

556
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,040
You wouldn't have lost the baby
if you hadn't

557
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
practiced like crazy.

558
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,000
Mom!

559
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,360
Am I not right?

560
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,640
Don't stop me!

561
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Guohua is our own son.

562
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,240
We worked hard to raise him.

563
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,520
Don't you think it's too cruel

564
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,760
for us and Guohua

565
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,120
to not have a child?

566
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,720
That's enough.

567
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,960
Just let me speak.

568
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,880
I am so mad.

569
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
Bravo.

570
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,960
You deserved to be
the concertmaster of the art troupe.

571
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,560
Guess who I met today.

572
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,320
Who was it?

573
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,480
Can't you guess who it was

574
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,320
based on my question?

575
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,920
Talk properly.

576
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,200
Don't be mean.

577
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,320
It's Xiao Chunsheng
who you still can't forget.

578
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,040
Don't you want to know
how he is doing?

579
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,160
How is he doing?

580
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,240
Pretty good.

581
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,200
He and Xiaomei has a daughter

582
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,400
named Xiao Beibei.

583
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,520
She's over 10 already.

584
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,560
What?

585
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,520
Feeling sorry for yourself?

586
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,400
Or you regret it now?

587
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,280
Yes,

588
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,080
I regret it.

589
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
So many years have passed,

590
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,120
can you let it go?

591
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,400
Are you regretting losing our baby

592
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,840
or are you regretting

593
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,520
marrying me?

594
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,200
I'll sleep in the guest room.

595
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,700
(Be disciplined)

596
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Director Chen, your home is here.

597
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Go home.

598
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
This is your home.

599
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Pull over.

600
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,800
Mr. Xiao, there's still some distance.

601
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,520
It's OK.

602
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
You can leave now.

603
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,240
Why are you down here?

604
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,160
Beibei fell asleep,

605
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,160
so I came down for a walk.

606
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,880
You are lying.

607
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm afraid my husband might be lost,

608
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,640
so I came down to look for him.

609
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Do not worry.

610
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,400
I won't be lost.

611
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,480
Did it go well?

612
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,960
I guess.

613
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,240
They'll come to our factory next week

614
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,360
to do a research.

615
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,400
We'll make it work.

616
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,200
What about things other than business?

617
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm not sure.

618
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
I think they have both

619
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,320
changed a lot.

620
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,080
That's normal.

621
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,120
You have also

622
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,440
changed a lot.

623
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,480
Really?

624
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,320
But they said I haven't changed much.

625
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
That's the opinion of outsiders.

626
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,320
By the way, Xiaomei,

627
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,800
you talk to Ye Fang a lot.

628
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,520
Did she tell you

629
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,560
anything between her and Hongjun?

630
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,120
She almost never mentioned that.

631
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,720
You know,

632
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,040
she is smart.

633
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,560
She doesn't talk about that a lot.

634
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,520
What's wrong?

635
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,240
Nothing.

636
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,720
Let's not

637
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,440
worry about them.

638
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,000
You are home.

639
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Did you drink?

640
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,720
Yes.

641
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,760
You're drunk.

642
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,040
I didn't drink much. I'm fine.

643
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,000
Guess who I met today.

644
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,960
I met Chunsheng.

645
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,960
I found out that
he and Tong Xiaomei have a child.

646
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,200
You never talked to me

647
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,320
about Chunsheng,

648
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,960
were you afraid that
I might ask you to have a baby?

649
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,680
Is that so?
