3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
You have recovered?

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
I told you that you'd be fine!

5
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,280
You've been prophetic since childhood.

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,560
Xiaomei.

7
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,480
There you are.

8
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
Xiaomei,

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,760
I never knew

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,080
you could cook so many dishes.

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,560
You learned cooking for someone, huh?

12
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,160
You were too busy

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
to notice if Xiaomei could cook.

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Just focus on your food.

15
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,760
This is really surprising

16
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,360
that you two are together.

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,680
But you know what?

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm not saying this in hindsight,

19
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,680
but I thought you could be together.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
Just enjoy the food.

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,920
OK.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,560
Have some more, Hongling.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,240
Here.

24
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Come on, Guohua.

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
A toast to you.

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,880
You came back with Hongling.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,600
Will you take her to meet your parents?

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
When can we go to your wedding?

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
Here. A toast to both of you.

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Congratulations.

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,080
Cheers.

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,760
Come on, guys.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
Let's drink together.

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,440
- OK.
- OK.

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Cheers.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,560
Life is really fun.

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
I remember what happened on the ice rink

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,440
like it was yesterday.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
That year,

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Chunsheng painted a portrait,

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
had a fight,

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
and chased a girl.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
I finally realized

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,720
that he did everything for you.

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,600
I was so dumb that I was thinking,

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
"Could anyone pursue a girl

47
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
in someone else's name?"

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,640
Well, yes.

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
What's wrong with you?

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,000
Can't drinking shut you up yet?

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Hongling, ignore him.

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,320
When are you getting married?

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Hongling and I haven't discussed it yet.

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,840
In some days, at least.

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,280
After we're back in the army.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,800
Then...

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,560
Not that late.

58
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,400
Guohua and I have been
together for years.

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,840
No need to wait anymore.

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,360
In a day or two.

61
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
When you're all here in Beijing,

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
we'll get married.

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,840
Do come to our wedding.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
What do you say, Guohua?

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Hongling is so real.

66
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,280
She hasn't changed at all.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,600
On the ice rink,

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Hongling was the...

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,600
Stop, stop.

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
Why do you keep talking
about the ice rink?

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,080
If you want to watch me skate, say it.

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
Don't beat around the bush.

73
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
Who wants to skate?

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Me.

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Is the ice rink still open?

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
No, I'm afraid.

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
It's open.

78
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Why is it not?

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
Then let's go skating tomorrow.

80
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,320
It's the last time, I guess.

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
I want to skate, too.

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Let's go there.

83
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,920
OK.

84
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
At two tomorrow, see you
where we used to meet.

85
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on, it's the Spring Festival.

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
Let's drink together.

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
Happy Spring Festival!

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Happy Spring Festival!

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,960
- Happy Spring Festival!
- Happy Spring Festival!

90
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,020
(Unit One)

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,000
Guohua.

92
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
How's everything going in the army?

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Not bad.

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
Just so-so, nothing special.

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,840
How are you doing?

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
Look.

97
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
I can walk now.

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,880
But run... Still can't.

99
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
You'll get better.

100
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah.

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,120
I have to be patient.

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm lucky enough to get back on my feet.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Thanks to Xiaomei.

104
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,280
You and Xiaomei...

105
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Is it true that you're together?

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,240
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
How could it not be true?

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
It's true, with no doubt.

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Good.

110
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,360
Glad to know that.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Guohua,

112
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,400
do you remember

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,080
I told you about a girl

114
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
in the stack room?

115
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,240
Stack room?

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,080
Oh, I remember.

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
You said you wanted to pursue her.

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,240
That girl is Xiaomei?

119
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
Xiaomei knew it a long time ago.

120
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
But I was too dumb

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,080
to know it all the time.

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Then how did you recognize her?

123
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,960
She accompanied me
when I returned to Beijing,

124
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,160
had the operation,

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
and did the rehabilitation.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
If I still hadn't recognized her,

127
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,880
I would be too ungrateful.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Wish you a nice life with Hongling.

129
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,020
(Qianhai Beiyan)

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Where's Hongling?

131
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
She's back home to fetch something.

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,240
Chunsheng...

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Why haven't he and Xiaomei come?

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
They said they would come soon

135
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
and asked us to play

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
instead of waiting for them.

137
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,080
What's wrong?

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,880
Where's Xiao Chunsheng?

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
Will you skate or not?

140
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,320
Then what did you come here for?

141
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,760
You saw them, huh?

142
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
What? Happy?

143
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,360
Are you done talking?

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
Yanqiu, Tian.

145
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Where's Guohua?

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I'll go for them.

147
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,400
Chunsheng.

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,160
Xiaomei.

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,600
Guohua,

150
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
since I left the army,

151
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800
I haven't got any information.

152
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Tell me something about it, OK?

153
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,720
Go.

154
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Shall we skate?

155
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,400
Go.

156
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,960
Funny.

157
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,680
Sometimes, I think

158
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,800
we have a bone.

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,080
Look.

160
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
We're never

161
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,960
the leading roles.

162
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
At a party,

163
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,040
in the army,

164
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
or even on the ice rink,

165
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,640
we're always

166
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,320
the supporting roles.

167
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,760
Spotlight

168
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,040
always follows them.

169
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,840
You and I

170
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,160
have to stay in the shadow.

171
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,480
You skate as well as before.

172
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
Not at all.

173
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
Why didn't you chase me?

174
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,360
Xiaomei doesn't like to skate too fast.

175
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,960
So, I'm used to skating slowly.

176
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
Now that you're worried,

177
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,200
why did you let them skate alone?

178
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
Because today,

179
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
I have something important to tell you.

180
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,560
Listen.

181
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
The same old song.

182
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,200
It has the same melody.

183
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,920
But it's not

184
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,080
the old same song.

185
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,400
Chunsheng,

186
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,960
I'm getting married.

187
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,760
Do you get it?

188
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm getting married.

189
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,560
Guohua,

190
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm now a doctor.

191
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,880
Did you know?

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,120
Not until now.

193
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,200
Congratulations.

194
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
I used to be a nurse.

195
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,720
You must be aware, right?

196
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,480
Yes.

197
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,080
Before,

198
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,120
I longed to be a doctor

199
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,120
because I thought

200
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,000
a nurse only took care of patients

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
and looked less decent than a doctor.

202
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Like you said,

203
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
nurses are supporting roles

204
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,120
and the spotlight doesn't follow them.

205
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,120
But,

206
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,920
when I become a doctor,

207
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I realized

208
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,040
that nursing care

209
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
is very important.

210
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
When I was a nurse,

211
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
I considered everything for the patients.

212
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,560
Was the ward

213
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
ventilative or noisy?

214
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,080
What would patients have for lunch?

215
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
How often should the bedding be changed?

216
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,080
A lot of trifles.

217
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,480
When I served as a doctor,

218
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,600
I found out such trifles

219
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,760
shaped me.

220
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,920
So, in any case,

221
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,200
I give the top priority to patients.

222
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,360
As far as I see,

223
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,720
I'm not only treating them,

224
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,920
but also taking care of them

225
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
so that they can live in the hospital

226
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
with as much dignity as they can enjoy.

227
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
But what if I was a doctor
in the beginning?

228
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
What if I was the leading role

229
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
when the story began?

230
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
Then in my mind,

231
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
I'm afraid,

232
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
I would only long to be promoted

233
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,960
and get more powerful.

234
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
I would want the spotlight on me.

235
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Then, I can't be what I am now.

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,600
So, Guohua,

237
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,040
it's sometimes just an issue of timing.

238
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,680
At the right time,

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
it doesn't matter

240
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
whether you have the spotlight.

241
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,080
Staying in the shadow
would be even cooler.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,040
Right?

243
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,310
It's so clear-headed of you.

244
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,110
Let me ask you something.

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Do you really trust him that much?

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Xiao Chunsheng,

247
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,960
you dumped me with a letter.

248
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,880
Do you want to pretend nothing happened?

249
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
I won't.

250
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Hongling,

251
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,000
I loved you.

252
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,560
I would never deny that.

253
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,920
Then you...

254
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
But what's gone is gone.

255
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Look.

256
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,400
Just like this place.

257
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,520
When we were young,

258
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
we often skated here.

259
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
But now, we seldom come.

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,120
It doesn't mean
this place no longer matters.

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,320
But in our lives,

262
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
something else matters more.

263
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
Are you sure it's Tong Xiaomei?

264
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,880
If it was me who got on the train,

265
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
would everything be different?

266
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,280
Hongling,

267
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
no buts.

268
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,400
Like I said,

269
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,640
we made

270
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
our own choices.

271
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,680
After choosing what we want,

272
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,720
don't regret it.

273
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Don't look back.

274
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,440
Go.

See you.

301
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,440
The snow scene here is gorgeous.

302
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,680
Do you like it?

303
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,080
Yes.

304
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,520
I grew up in the military compound

305
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
and I'm fed up.

306
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
It's great to live here.

307
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,560
The houses are close

308
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,840
and the neighbors are nice.

309
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,400
Here,

310
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,240
I feel calm and secure.

311
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,600
Chunsheng.

312
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,800
Actually,

313
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,720
I don't skate very well.

314
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,040
You skated well last time.

315
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,720
Because you were holding my hand.

316
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,920
I would always hold your hand.

317
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,160
Teach me to skate.

318
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,160
I won't.

319
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Why not?

320
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,600
Why won't you teach me?

321
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Say something.

322
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,760
My silly girl.

323
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
What?

324
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,280
What's wrong with you?

325
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
Why didn't you answer me?

326
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
Why won't you teach me?

327
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Come on.

328
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,040
So much dust.

329
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,840
What a surprise!

330
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,920
This room hasn't changed at all.

331
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,960
Yeah.

332
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,400
It's still here.

333
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,580
(Dictionary of Chinese Pharmacy)

334
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,000
I really miss it.

335
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
I remember

336
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,040
when I was reading here,

337
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,280
I wondered

338
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,640
who also read here.

339
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,840
So, it was you, my girl.

340
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,280
Right.

341
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,160
That was me.

342
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,920
What? Unsatisfied?

343
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,400
No, no.

344
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm very satisfied.

345
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Actually,

346
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
I didn't see you clearly.

347
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
I just saw

348
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
someone

349
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,240
flitting by.

350
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
But I was sure

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,000
it must be a pretty girl.

352
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,040
Come on.

353
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
Don't be honey-lipped.

354
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,160
Leaving?

355
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,560
Are you angry?

356
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
I'm not angry.

357
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
You didn't say that back then.

358
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
What did I say?

359
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
I can't remember.

360
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,080
How about you remind me?

361
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,240
Fine, fine. My fault.

362
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,560
I was wrong.

363
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,880
I lied to you.

364
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,840
About that?

365
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,320
I told you

366
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,360
I saw that girl was He Hongling.

367
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,680
I lied.

368
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
I know.

369
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,360
Because you...

370
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,120
You loved her.

371
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,440
Right. That's why I lied.

372
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,720
I understand.

373
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
But actually,

374
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,640
I knew she wasn't the girl
a long time ago.

375
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,920
In recent years,

376
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
I've been having the same dream.

377
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,120
In the dream,

378
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,920
I was chasing a girl.

379
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
I kept chasing her

380
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,600
as if I was chasing my dream.

381
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
But never could I

382
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,000
see her face.

383
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,320
Every time I thought

384
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,600
I could catch up with her,

385
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
she disappeared.

386
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,520
Until one day...

387
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,600
I finally saw her.

398
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,400
What?

399
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought, "I'm so glad it's you."

400
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
So, I want to tell you this.

401
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,160
It's not because you came
back to Beijing with me

402
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,720
and accompanied me in rehabilitation

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,440
that I fell in love with you.

404
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,360
Maybe earlier.

405
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,880

406
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
I was in love with you.

Qi Tian is right.

to be fearless of anything.

410
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,400
But actually, I fear to face inward.

411
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,000
And when

412
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,880
someone is scared of something,

413
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,600
he avoids it subconsciously
instead of facing it.

414
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
It was my problem.

415
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,760
Over all these years,

416
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
I didn't dare to face it

417
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,280
so that you had to

418
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,800

since I came back from the army,

423

I've figured out many things.

(Wedding)

439

(How time flew in Beijing.)

got closer and closer.)

(had a grand wedding)

443
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,320
(before going back to the army.)

444
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,320
(On different positions,)

445
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,820
(they worked hard respectively.)

(Every one of them)

451
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,240
(kept growing like pliable widow branches)

452
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,440
(in early spring of Beijing.)

453
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,340
(Beijing Railway Station)

454
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,040

00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,880
Xiang Dong,

461
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
why do you look thinner?

462
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,520
You two are so late.

463
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,280
The rest of us are waiting.

464
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,920
We're back now.

465
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,880
Chunsheng,

466
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,880
are your legs OK now?

467
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,670
Yes. I've recovered.

468
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,400
Chunsheng,

469
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,880
we're all together again.

470
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,320
Let's go on to roar in Beijing.

471
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,280
Come on.

472
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,710
What are your plans?

473
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,920
We'll wait for assigned jobs.

474
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,840
If we can't get a job,

475
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,480
we'll do some small business like Tian.

476
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:41,880
Right.

477
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,440
OK.

478
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,190
That's not bad.

479
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,230
If you need my help,

480
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,800
let me know.

481
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,360
Don't hesitate to tell me.

482
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,120
OK, Chunsheng.

483
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,000
We won't hesitate.

484
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,150
All right, let's go.

485
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,710
- Go.
- Let's go home.

486
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,080
Come on, Chunsheng.

487
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,840
- I'll carry it myself.
- Come on.

488
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,520
Go.

489
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,080
(After Xiaohui became the leading model,)

490
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
(she was too busy with fashion shows)

491
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,960
(to go home.)

492
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,440
(Heizi got suspicious again.)

493
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,960
Anyone in?

494
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,680
Open the door!

495
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,320
Coming!

496
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,360
I'm Xiaohui's colleague.

497
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,080
Is this where Xiao Chunsheng lives?

498
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,040
Yes.

499
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,520
Heizi and his men
smashed our presentation.

500
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,200
Xiaohui sent me to Xiao Chunsheng,

501
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,320
saying he could stop them.

502
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,520
Where are they?

503
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,400
There.

504
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
Out they come.

505
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,720
He's the attacker.

506
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,480
Heizi!

507
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,440
It's him.

508
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,520
Get in the car.

509
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,040
That man was terrible.

510
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,280
In front of so many people,

511
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,000
he rushed onto the stage
and punched Xiaohui hard.

512
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,440
He even tried to strip her!

513
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,880
She wasn't wearing too much.

514
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,720
Where's Xiaohui?

515
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,080
In the dressing room.

516
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,160
She doesn't see anyone.

517
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
I'll go check on her.

518
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,160
OK.

519
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
Xiaohui.

520
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
Xiaohui, it's me, Yanqiu.

521
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,680
Come in.

522
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,560
Xiaohui.

523
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Yanqiu,

524
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,480
when he's out of the detention house,
give this to him.

525
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,240
What's this?

526
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,780
(Divorce Agreement)

527
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,560
Beat him!

528
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Heizi,

529
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,680
do you want to marry me?

530
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,960
Yes.

531
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,280
Even dreamed of that.

532
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,360
Xiaohui.

533
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
Xiaohui, Xiaohui.

534
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
Stop, Xiaohui.

535
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,560
Xiaohui.

536
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,840
Heizi did the wrong thing
and should learn his lesson.

537
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,040
You want a divorce and I won't stop you.

538
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,600
But shouldn't you

539
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,800
talk to him when he gets out

540
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,200
before divorcing him?

541
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Marriage is between a couple.

542
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
So is divorce.

543
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
You should put an end together.

544
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,440
I am putting an end.

545
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,200
Yanqiu,

546
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
look at my face.

547
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,680
Look at it.

548
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,360
It's been so many years.

549
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
I don't know what he thinks of me.

550
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,280
But I know

551
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,160
I've been very loyal to him!

552
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,040
Yes, yes.

553
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,120
We all know that. So does Heizi.

554
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,240
These years, those men...

555
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,800
Right.

556
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,960
That's right.

557
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,800
Some men wanted to pursue me.

558
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,520
Some wanted to make out with me.

559
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
Some women even told me

560
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,880
when picking a man,

561
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
we should pick handsome

562
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,920
and cool guys,

563
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,160
or rich guys

564
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,000
who had great power.

565
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,400
They seemed to think

566
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,560
a woman had to get a man like that.

567
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,680
But I'm not that kind of woman.

568
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,840
Right. We know that.

569
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,400
Never mind.

570
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,600
I don't bother to argue with them.

571
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,680
Yanqiu,

572
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,200
over all these years,

573
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
you've witnessed everything.

574
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,200
He and I often fought.

575
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,280
Do you know

576
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,760
how we got to know each other?

577
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,160
I remember you said

578
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,440
you saved Heizi.

579
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,320
Near Bayi Lake.

580
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,000
That year, a boy fell into the lake.

581
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,080
He jumped to save him.

582
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,680
He must have been an idiot.

583
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
He couldn't swim at all.

584
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,960
And he was nearly drowned.

585
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,240
Luckily, he met me.

586
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,040
It took me a lot of trouble

587
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
to get him out of the water.

588
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,720
I even gave him a rescue breath.

589
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,520
He was all right,

590
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
but didn't wake up.

591
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,400
He wasn't as strong as he is now.

592
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,240
He was skinny

593
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
and sallow.

594
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
His hair was wet,

595
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
sticking up stiffly.

596
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,880
He was even grinding his teeth,

597
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
just like a naughty boy,
seven or eight years old,

598
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,200
who didn't admit his mistake.

599
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
At that time,

600
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,400
I was somehow touched.

601
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
I thought

602
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,200
he was like my younger brother.

603
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,360
You have a younger brother?

604
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,520
No.

605
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,360
I only have elder brothers.

606
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
And they couldn't be worse.

607
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Later, he woke up.

608
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
When he saw me, he was surprised.

609
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,000
I was holding him in my arms, huh?

610
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,320
He just noticed that.

611
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,080
His cheeks

612
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
reddened immediately.

613
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,040
His cheeks could redden?

614
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,320
Brick red.

615
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,920
I didn't know

616
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
what he was thinking.

617
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Later he told me,

618
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,120
he fell in love with me at first sight.

619
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,760
So did I.

620
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,960
Xiaohui, how about...

621
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,640
It's OK, Yanqiu.

622
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,160
It's all over.

623
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,680
Good.

624
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,000
It's really good.

625
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,360
When we got married,

626
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,240
I decided it alone.

627
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,520
Now, we shall divorce.

628
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,160
I can handle it alone, too.

629
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,520
He and I

630
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,440
would never see each other again.

631
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,200
Xiaohui.

632
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,200
Yanqiu, I should go.

633
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,000
Xiaohui.
