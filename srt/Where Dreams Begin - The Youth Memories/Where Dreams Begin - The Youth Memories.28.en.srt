00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,820
(Jingxi Detention House)

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
I'll tell you what.

5
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,640
Think.

6
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Totally four million soldiers

7
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,680
protect our land
of 9.6 million square kilometers

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
and one billion people.

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Averagely,

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
every soldier has to bear

11
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
heavy pressure.

12
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,680
And every troop has
brilliant achievements.

13
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,840
But when disarmament was decided,

14
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,080
it was indeed done.

15
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,720
All right.

16
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
I think the government is

17
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,800
quite decisive.

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Think about it.

19
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
Our country

20
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,720
has been in peace for over 30 years.

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Emphasis will certainly be put

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
on economic development.

23
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
Orders are orders.

24
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
When fighting a war,

25
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
we go wherever we are sent.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
And when the war is over,

27
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,800
we do whatever we're asked to.

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,080
I've made up my mind.

29
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,120
I can no longer

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,400
make achievements in the war.

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
Then I will make contributions

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,960
to socialist construction.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,200
By the way,

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,600
will Guohua

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
be on the disarmament list?

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Guohua...

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Hongjun,

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,400
don't worry about nothing.

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Let me tell you this.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,760
His position will be always stable.

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,640
Think.

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Among us who joined the army,

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
Guohua is the highest in status.

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
But anyway,

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,600
we can't compare to him.

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,080
He's from a powerful family.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
He works hard, too.

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,280
And the timing is perfect.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,400
Right.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,880
Let me make my point.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,760
I am

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
really jealous of Guohua.

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,680
Chunsheng.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
Chunsheng.

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,920
Sorry, we're late.

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,560
- Sorry.
- Chunsheng.

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
You're all here. I'm sorry.

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Xiaomei.

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,680
You two have been back for days.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
What about your jobs?

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
We made a decision, Chunsheng.

63
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
We just haven't told you.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
- We're selling electrical appliances.
- Yanqiu.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,270
Tian.

66
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,510
We've just started a small business

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
and it's good.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,160
Glad to hear that.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,800
Chunsheng,

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
I have to complain.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
You had your leader wait
for quite a while

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,040
and that's not inappropriate.

73
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Right.

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
Listen.

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,680
Our brotherhood

76
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,040
cannot be provoked.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Come on. Be seated.

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,440
- Sit, all of you.
- Come on.

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,120
Take your seats.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Hongjun, you sit here.

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,600
No, I...

83
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Just sit down.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Today is your big day

85
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
and the dinner is about you.

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
Sit here with no worries.

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,840
It's OK. I'll hang it here.

88
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,400
Everyone's here.

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,040
Here, Hongjun.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Let me fill your glass.

91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,040
Tian,

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,640
here.

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,520
- Yanqiu,
- Let me do it.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,200
fill his glass.

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,640
Leave it to me.

96
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
Let me say something, guys.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
Today, we're having dinner together,

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,400
to congratulate Hongjun
on becoming the Division Chief.

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,200
Among all of us,

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Hongjun is the most promising.

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,840
He's always clever

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and he was an academic achiever.

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
Especially after the resumption

104
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
of the college entrance exam,

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
he studied hard

106
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,280
and went to a famous university.

107
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
He was even

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
the president of the Student Union.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,120
And of course, he should give credit

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,960
to Ye Fang's wise recognition.

111
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Fang,

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,120
thank you for your supervision of him.

113
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,600
A toast to you alone.

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,240
Hope you'll keep pushing him

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,040
to make more progress.

116
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,920
OK.

117
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers. I'll drink it up.

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
And this toast

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
is to Yanqiu and Tian.

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,040
Wish you a better and better life!

121
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
- Look, Chunsheng holds his liquor.
- Cheers.

122
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,680
Don't worry, Chunsheng.

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
I will work hard

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,640
to give her and our baby a great life.

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,280
You will.

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Yanqiu, are you...

127
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,760
Pregnant?

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,680
No, no, no.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
He's talking nonsense.

130
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm not pregnant yet.

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,400
He's just nagging.

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
I have to.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
When we have a baby,

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,640
I'll care about no one,

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
but you and the baby.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,640
Tian,

137
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
I didn't expect you to be so considerate

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,040
after getting married.

139
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,800
I am, of course.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,000
I appear to be tough

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,440
but I'm actually gentle.

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Careless but still considerate, right?

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,360
Let's just drink. Hurry.

144
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,760
Here.

145
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,840
- Let me fill your glass.
- Fill your glass.

146
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,480
Come on.

147
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,320
Fill your glasses, guys.

148
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
Let me fill your glass.

149
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
Come on, Tian.

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,160
Here, Hongjun.

151
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,520
Come on. What a happy day!

152
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,160
Cheers.

153
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Cheers.

154
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,120
Come on.

155
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,440
I'm OK, I'm OK.

156
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm not drunk.

157
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,200
Have some water.

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,280
Let's have a baby.

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
I told you I didn't want a baby.

160
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
But why not?

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Give me a reason.

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
Do what he asks me to.

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,880
Mom, how would you touch my stuff?

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
What are you talking about?

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,560
Why can't I touch my daughter's stuff?

166
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,520
This is my diary.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,800
How could you get it out
without my permission?

168
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,980
(Enlistment Application)

169
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,040
You're back.

170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Mrs. Ye.

171
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Chen Tao, come in.

172
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
It's cold out there, isn't it?

173
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,280
Come and sit.

174
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,000
Take your seat here.

175
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
You look taller.

176
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,080
But you look thinner, Mrs. Ye.

177
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
I've brought you some supplements.

178
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
It's so nice of you.

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Take off your overcoat.

180
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,240
Or when you go out,
you would catch a cold.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080
How are your parents doing?

182
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,840
Good, good.

183
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Have you had dinner?

184
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,760
Yes.

185
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,880
Let me do it myself.

186
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,790
Thank you.

187
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,280
I won't be a good mother.

188
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,560
You will be.

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
You will be a good mother.

190
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
Give me a baby, please,

191
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,600
OK?

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Hongjun,

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,560
we made it clear before getting married

194
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,760
that I didn't want a baby.

195
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
You agreed.

196
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
But I...

197
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,600
Right, I agreed.

198
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,880
I did that

199
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,320
only because I love you.

200
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
You can't bully me

201
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,240
just because I love you, can you?

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
I love you, so I can do anything.

203
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,080
I even took the blame for raping, right?

204
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,160
Have some compassion on me, OK?

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,240
Chen Hongjun, don't push it.

206
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,840
For your official career thing,

207
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I relented.

208
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,800
In the baby's case, not a chance.

209
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
I asked for your opinion.

210
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
If you didn't agree,

211
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
you should have refused.

212
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
But you agreed and then regretted it.

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,800
You're not like a real man.

214
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
What are you talking about?

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm not a real man?

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm not, huh?

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
Then who is?

218
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Who's a real man?

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
Xiao Chunsheng?

220
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
Then why didn't you marry him?

221
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
We should calm down.

222
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,400
Let's talk tomorrow.

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Ye Fang,

224
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,760
do you love me?

225
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
You've never loved me, have you?

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
You only want a man

227
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,480
who is dead gone on you.

228
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,800
Even if it's not me,

229
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,720
it can be anyone else.

230
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,000
Right?

231
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,760
All you want

232
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,640
is a puppy

233
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
who you can always push around.

234
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,320
Hongjun,

235
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,280
except for the baby,

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,960
I can give you anything.

237
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
To our marriage,

238
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,200
you can put an end at any time.

239
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,120
Ma'am,

240
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,200
I heard

241
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,920
the disarmament would be done

242
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,760
and the Art Troupe might be dissolved.

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,320
Is that true?

244
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Hongling,

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
you're an experienced soldier.

246
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,520
If it's true,

247
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,360
do not feel defensive.

248
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
You have to help me

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,480
persuade other members.

250
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
I understand.

251
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,720
But to be honest,

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,800
I don't want to leave the army.

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,000
I know.

254
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
You're our best performer.

255
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,480
If you could stay,

256
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
you would have a better future.

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
But it's the needs of the times.

258
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
We can do nothing.

259
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,080
Ma'am,

260
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
is there no other way out?

261
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,720
For personnel turnover,

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,440
I can't interfere too much.

263
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,560
Actually,

264
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
some backbone performers can stay.

265
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,120
It's up to our superiors, though.

266
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,160
You're saying...

267
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,800
Hongling,

268
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
go back and discuss it

269
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
with your husband.

270
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
I always know

271
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,440
you have your pursuit of arts.

272
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
Remember this.

273
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
Wherever you go,

274
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,080
keep playing the violin

275
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,880
and never give it up.

276
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,040
I'll keep it in mind.

277
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,880
Hongling,

278
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,120
there are rumors

279
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,960
about the disarmament.

280
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,040
What's your point?

281
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't want to leave, with no doubt.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,480
To stay in the Art Troupe
is all that I want.

283
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,400
I'm unlike you.

284
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,560
You're a Deputy Battalion Commander

285
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,560
and your superiors think highly of you.

286
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,600
Even if you're transferred
to another military region,

287
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,920
capable as you are,

288
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,040
you will only be promoted.

289
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,160
But I'm in a different case.

290
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,240
If the Art Troupe is dissolved,

291
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
I'll have to leave the army.

292
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
I asked Mrs. Huang today.

293
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,280
She said we may have the chance

294
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
to keep some backbone performers.

295
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,760
Guohua,

296
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,320
could you please

297
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
help me stay?

298
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Hongling,

299
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
must we stay in the army?

300
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Hongjun is now a leader in Beijing.

301
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
I hear others are also doing very well

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
in business.

303
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,160
Times have changed.

304
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,080
We have more choices.

305
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,080
But anyway,

306
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,360
since I was little,

307
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,120
my real ability hasn't been recognized

308
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,280
until I joined the army.

309
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,960
As long as I can stay,

310
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,480
I will not leave.

311
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
In a few days, let's go back
to Beijing first.

312
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,100
(Dadi Western-style Restaurant)

313
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,680
Guohua.

314
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,120
Come on.

315
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Keep drinking.

316
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,440
No, no.

317
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
It's been a week.

318
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,960
Even if you aren't drunk, I am.

319
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,960
Nonsense.

320
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,440
How long haven't we seen each other?

321
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,120
We should drink for a month.

322
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,360
Hongjun,

323
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,240
you're really different now.

324
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,440
You've got the official's manners.

325
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,680
What official?

326
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
I'm just a civil servant,

327
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,880
and I serve the people.

328
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
You know what, Guohua?

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,760
They two

330
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
have really made a lot of money.

331
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
They open stores

332
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,200
and do business.

333
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,960
They earned quite a lot of money.

334
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
My job isn't awesome.

335
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,160
It's nothing at all.

336
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
You have?

337
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Just small businesses.

338
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,160
Guohua,

339
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,280
you and Chunsheng used to be

340
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,240
the best in our compound.

341
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,280
We all admired you.

342
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,560
That's right.

343
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
When you went out, we followed you.

344
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Awesome.

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
But you didn't expect this, huh?

346
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,600
After a dozen years,

347
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,000
Hongjun

348
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,000
has been the highest in status.

349
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
Chunsheng is doing great, too.

350
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,040
A lot of people ask him for help.

351
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
He's even busier than me.

352
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,880
See?

353
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,280
He's too busy to come to our gathering.

354
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,880
And Qi Tian,

355
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
the famous guy in Beijing.

356
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,920
What was he before?

357
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
Heizi and his minions

358
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
were profiteers.

359
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,440
And now,

360
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,200
he's the best at doing business.

361
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,080
And me.

362
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,720
I used to be the most common.

363
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,120
Now,

364
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
anyway,

365
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
I've made some money.

366
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,200
Dongzi,

367
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
let's talk about no one else.

368
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,080
You've just made
the right decision of demobilization.

369
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Now, the government calls for

370
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,640
demobilized soldiers to work
in all walks of life

371
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,880
still as the backbone.

372
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
What you did

373
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
has responded to this call.

374
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,960
And think about it.

375
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,040
If you were still in the army,

376
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
how could you buy a house

377
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,280
for your wife?

378
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,840
How many years would you save the money?

379
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,320
That's right.

380
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,960
Ten years ago,

381
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
I could never imagine

382
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
I would have this day.

383
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,840
When I was demobilized,

384
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,200
do you remember?

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
When I heard
I could no longer be a soldier,

386
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,720
I was stunned.

387
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,240
I wondered

388
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
what I could do later.

389
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,560
And I told Xiaoliu about it.

390
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,160
Xiaoliu,

391
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,680
do you remember?

392
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,680
That night, he took me out for drinking

393
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,350
and didn't let me go home.

394
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,110
Do you remember?

395
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,310
He was so worried.

396
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,350
He said,

397
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,280
"Xiaoliu,

398
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
after I'm demobilized,

399
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,640
how disgraced will I be?"

400
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,560
So,

401
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,680
no one should look back.

402
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Or he would laugh at himself.

403
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
Now, there are more options.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,680
Making money

405
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,320
also makes us proud.

406
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,760
That's right.

407
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
Times have changed.

408
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
Being a soldier, a worker,
or a civil servant

409
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,160
used to be the most popular

410
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
and respectable,

411
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,760
right?

412
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,720
But what now?

413
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,680
Money talks.

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,640
Oh, no.

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,400
Guohua,

416
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,960
I... I don't mean harm.

417
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
I'm not talking about you.

418
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,560
You're different.

419
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,760
You're the Deputy Battalion Commander.

420
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,760
When disarmament is applied,

421
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,240
and when you're transferred

422
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,400
to the new military region,

423
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
you'll be the Regimental Commander.

424
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,080
- Yeah.
- That's right.

425
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,920
Come on. To Commander Ye.

426
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,320
- Right. To Commander Ye.
- To Commander Ye.

427
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,680
Cheers.

428
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,200
Xiang Dong, only one question.

429
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,840
If I exchange my position
for your current business,

430
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,240
will you accept it?

431
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,520
Umm...

432
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,400
Guohua,

433
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,120
don't set me up.

434
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,480
You will.

435
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,400
Why would you not?

436
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
Don't waste the chance.

437
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,720
But Dongzi,

438
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,840
you said something wrong.

439
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,080
How could you say he set you up?

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Drink some as the punishment.

441
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
Drink. Come on.

442
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
I'm wrong. Sorry.

443
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,760
I'll drink it up, OK?

444
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,800
But Guohua,

445
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,040
to tell you the truth.

446
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,600
You're from a better family than us.

447
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,120
If you do business,

448
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
you'll be the best of us.

449
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,800
Say no more.

450
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,240
Guohua is great,

451
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
whatever he does.

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
Come on, cheers.

453
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,080
Cheers.

454
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,800
Have some water.

455
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,120
Why?

456
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,560
Why can they make a lot of money

457
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
and be ten-thousand-yuan households?

458
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,480
Why can I not?

459
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm no worse than them!

460
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
And Xiao Chunsheng.

461
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,240
He didn't even come to see me.

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
My wife is prettier than theirs.

463
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,960
If you feel jealous,

464
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
say goodbye to them

465
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
and let's go back to the army tomorrow.

466
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,680
They can just make money.

467
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,960
Ten thousand yuan.

468
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
If I do business,

469
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,280
I can make even a million.

470
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,040
Mom, I got up too late.

471
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Nearly forgot I should come out with you.

472
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,760
When did you come back last night?

473
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Why did you drink that much?

474
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,480
I was just too happy.

475
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Where's Hongling?

476
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
She left home early this morning

477
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,640
to check the train tickets.

478
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,840
Remember.

479
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't drink that much
even for happy things.

480
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,840
Why did she hurry back?

481
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,440
Mom,

482
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,400
the disarmament will be applied, what...

483
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,480
Even in the disarmament,

484
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,040
you won't be demobilized.

485
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,360
Why would you worry?

486
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,680
But Hongling's Art Troupe
may not get away.

487
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,960
Mom,

488
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
the government calls on our people
to do business for a better life.

489
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
Actually, it's also good

490
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
to come back and do business.

491
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,080
What are you thinking?

492
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,760
To leave the army?

493
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
Mom,

494
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,760
there are national policies

495
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
that people could get rich.

496
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Well, I'm OK with that.

497
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,000
To respond to the national call,

498
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
our family should set an example.

499
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
Mom, is that what you think, too?

500
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,280
I have some selfish motives.

501
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
If you and Hongling can return early

502
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
and come back to us,

503
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,240
we'll be happy, too.

504
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,280
Mom, don't worry.

505
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
Your son is capable.

506
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Whatever I do,

507
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,920
I'll be the best.

508
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Really?

509
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,720
But in terms of having a baby,

510
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,200
you're not the best.

511
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,600
When you're back,

512
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,160
don't always goof around
with your friends.

513
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Do you hear me?

514
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,540
(Day and Night Shop)

515
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
Your business is thriving.

516
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,480
Especially vegetable shopping.

517
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
It's so convenient for everyone.

518
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,600
Tian,

519
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
you did it great.

520
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,960
Enough, enough.

521
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,640
Here, Ms. Feng.

522
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
- Take this.
- It's too much.

523
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,240
New carrots. It's very fresh.

524
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
Hongling is

525
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,280
always away from you.

526
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,360
We should take better care of you.

527
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,240
You know what a man I am.

528
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
When I give you this, just take it.

529
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,480
Don't reject it.

530
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,240
Last time, you gave me some eggs.

531
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,880
Now, so many vegetables.

532
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,320
If I come more often,

533
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,720
wouldn't you go bankrupt?

534
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
Don't underestimate my store.

535
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,320
It's just some vegetables.

536
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,240
- Qi Tian.
- Come on...

537
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,000
- Hongling.
- Why are you back?

538
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hongling, look.

539
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,560
He gave me so many vegetables.

540
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,720
Mom, take them.

541
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,480
I'm back with Guohua for the festival.

542
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,360
I've been too busy

543
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,640
to come and say hello.

544
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,720
Qi Tian, thank you.

545
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
You're welcome.

546
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,640
How's Yanqiu doing lately?

547
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,400
Very good.

548
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm taking good care of her, after all.

549
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,480
I give her everything great.

550
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,080
Since you met last time,

551
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
she has gained weight
of about four kilos.

552
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
What a good life you're living!

553
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
With this store,

554
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
you'll always have enough
to eat and drink.

555
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
When Yanqiu gets pregnant,

556
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
you'll have a happy family of three.

557
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,560
We're so jealous.

558
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
You flatter me.

559
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,200
When will you and Guohua have a baby?

560
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
They're still young and there's no hurry.

561
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,760
Tian,

562
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm getting back home with Hongling.

563
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
Thank you for the vegetables.

564
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,080
My pleasure, Ms. Feng.

565
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,080
See you.

566
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,560
Thanks.

567
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
Don't mention it.

568
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,680
You're leaving tomorrow?

569
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
I've got business in the army

570
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,360
and I have to go.

571
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
A few days ago, I went to see a doctor

572
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
for my headache.

573
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
And I told him about your problem.

574
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
The doctor said

575
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
you should take some Chinese medicine
for better health.

576
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,600
Mom,

577
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,760
you know I don't like Chinese medicine.

578
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
A girl's body has to be nourished.

579
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,760
You had terrible physical damage.

580
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,840
If you don't take some Chinese medicine,

581
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,280
when you get older,

582
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
you'll have many problems.

583
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
And it'll be too late to recover.

584
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,760
Fine. Next time.

585
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,240
Next time I'm back, I'll listen to you

586
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
and try some Chinese medicine.

587
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,360
Before,

588
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,920
I didn't worry when you had Guohua
around you in the army.

589
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
I don't know why

590
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,160
but since I was sick last time,

591
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,080
I've been too worried

592
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,520
to feel relieved.

593
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,560
You must have been thinking too much.

594
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,880
Uncle Dong said
you were sleepless lately.

595
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,480
Did you overthink instead of sleeping?

596
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,360
An aged person needs a little sleep.

597
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
Don't bother about his words.

598
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,640
Mom,

599
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,800
we

600
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,880
have rumors about the disarmament.

601
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
Our Art Troupe may be dissolved.

602
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
What do you do, then?

603
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
It's not decided yet.

604
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll discuss it with Guohua.

605
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,040
If he offers some help,

606
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,400
I will be able to stay.

607
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,200
But...

608
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
Over all these years,

609
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,240
you've won so many awards

610
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,160
and honors.

611
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,920
If you leave the army,

612
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,240
everything will be gone.

613
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,880
According to Mrs. Huang,

614
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,040
some quotas

615
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,800
will be left for
backbone performers like me.

616
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,520
If I get to a new military region,

617
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,440
I won't lose anything

618
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,120
and might even be promoted.

619
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,120
Really?

620
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,800
That's right.

621
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,160
Guohua is a Deputy Battalion Commander.

622
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,040
He can help you.

623
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
If you get to a new region,

624
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,600
try having a baby again.

625
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
We'll see.

626
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,160
You're my only daughter.

627
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,560
All I want

628
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,160
is that you can be happy

629
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,800
for a lifetime.

630
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,960
When you were little,
you suffered that much.

631
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,120
I just want you to live

632
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,960
a smooth and healthy life.

633
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,440
Don't worry, Mom.

634
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,880
I'll be happy.

635
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,360
Go.

636
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,760
Inspecting how the work goes, huh?

637
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,400
Don't tease me.

638
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,120
I just saw Ms. Feng and Hongling.

639
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,960
She's back?

640
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Yes.

641
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,960
They just left our store.

642
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,000
Why didn't she tell us?

643
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
I guess

644
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,920
Xiaomei and Chunsheng
have just been together

645
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,160
and she doesn't want to see them.

646
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,760
Oh,

647
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,880
I have something to ask you.

648
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,080
It's about Heizi and Xiaohui.

649
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
Will we not help him?

650
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,560
Help him?

651
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
Why would I?

652
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,680
Not punching him

653
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,560
can be my best mercy.

654
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,680
What did he do to Xiaohui?

655
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,920
If he had been a little bit nicer,

656
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
Xiaohui wouldn't have left.

657
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,720
He knows he was wrong

658
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,040
and I think Xiaohui still loves him.

659
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,440
Honey,

660
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,200
this isn't what we can interfere with.

661
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,240
When I can't even interfere,

662
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,560
why would you bother?

663
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,800
Fine, fine. You call the shots.

664
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,040
Tomato salads for dinner, OK?

665
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,640
OK.

666
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm OK with whatever you cook.

667
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,820
(Serve the People)

668
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
Come on, what's this about?

669
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
Disarmament, really?

670
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,160
What can we do, then?

671
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Is it true about the disarmament?

672
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,720
Will our troupe really be dissolved?

673
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,240
I heard the official document
would be issued today.

674
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,360
So,

675
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
it's very likely to be true.

676
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,840
How about you ask Hongling?

677
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
Her husband is
a Deputy Battalion Commander.

678
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,640
She must be aware of something.

679
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,840
Hongling,

680
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
do you know about the disarmament?

681
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,600
I'm not sure.

682
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
It's such a big issue.

683
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Didn't your husband tell you anything?

684
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
If it's true,

685
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,640
the official document will be issued.

686
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
Let's just wait.

687
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,640
How can we wait?

688
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,920
If the disarmament comes,

689
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
our troupe will be dissolved first.

690
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,600
If we do nothing until it's issued,

691
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
we'll have nowhere to go.

692
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,960
Hongling,

693
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
have you got a plan already?

694
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm really not sure about this.

695
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
It's no use asking me.

696
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,480
Mrs. Huang has come.

697
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,520
Stand up!

698
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,480
About the disarmament,

699
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
we just received the order.

700
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,960
I know all of you don't want to leave.

701
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,880
But it's a strategic policy adjustment

702
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,360
based on the change of the time.

703
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,280
As a soldier,

704
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,520
in any case,

705
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,960
you must respect and obey the order.

706
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
Even if you leave the army,

707
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,760
I still want you
to keep your military faith

708
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,560
and do your best in all walks of life.

709
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,000
Besides,

710
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,840
we've decided

711
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,520
to give the last performance.

712
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,280
Military leaders and combat heroes

713
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
will come and watch it.

714
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,840
Hope you'll hold on to the last

715
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,560
and give a perfect performance
for the last time.

716
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,240
- Yes!
- Yes!

717
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,400
(The Art Troupe would be dissolved.)

718
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,320
(Everyone was working hard)

719
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,280
(on the last performance.)

720
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,520
(Chen Can,)

721
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,080
(for what she did before,)

722
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,800
(apologized to He Hongling actively.)

723
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,320
(Be vigilant to defend our country)
(Old grudges)

724
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,120
(became the reluctance
to leave each other,)

725
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,760
(haunting every member of the Troupe.)

726
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,240
There you are.

727
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,560
Guohua,

728
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,240
the Art Troupe will be dissolved.

729
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,840
You want me to put in a good word

730
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,040
and get you to the new military region.

731
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,960
You don't want to help?

732
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,080
It's not like that.

733
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,640
But Hongling,

734
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,800
I've decided to return to Beijing.

735
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,760
I applied for demobilization.

736
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,760
You should go back with me.

737
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,280
Why didn't you tell me

738
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,840
before you applied?

739
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,480
And I told you

740
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
I didn't want to leave the army.

741
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,880
What could you do even if you stayed?

742
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,680
Now, it's when China turns

743
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,560
to an economic society.

744
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
It's the wave of time.

745
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,960
Let's just choose as most people do.

746
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,800
What's bad about that?

747
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,320
I don't know what wave it is.

748
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,960
I just know when you returned to Beijing

749
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,880
and saw your old friends get rich,

750
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,000
you became jealous

751
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
and dreamed of fortune, too.

752
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,400
Guohua,

753
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,600
I don't force you to stay in the army.

754
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,280
But why do you

755
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,920
not allow me to stay?

756
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
Why do I want to go back to Beijing?

757
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,080
For you

758
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,200
and our future.

759
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,000
If you insist on staying here,

760
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,640
we'll have to be away all the time.

761
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
What about our future?

762
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,120
And anyway,

763
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,880
we must obey the military order.

764
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,400
If I knew I had to
leave the army someday,

765
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,800
why would I have been trying so hard?

766
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,720
Heizi!

767
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Hei... Heizi!

768
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,880
Heizi.

769
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,680
Wake up. Bad news, Heizi.

770
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
Heizi, our goods
were detained by the Customs!

771
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,280
We've spent all our money on them.

772
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,560
Do something!

773
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,040
Detained?

774
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
Yes, all of them.

775
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Why?

776
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
I don't know.

777
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
Heizi, Heizi.

778
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,520
Come on, Heizi.

779
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,560
Where are you going?

780
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,280
You can't go to the Customs.

781
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
We aren't doing

782
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,400
a legal business.

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,360
Don't you remember

784
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,600
what happened to Sange and Li Shangyou?

785
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,800
What bad luck!

786
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,340
(Unit One)

787
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,080
Heizi?

788
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,400
You're off work, Chunsheng?

789
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,960
What are you doing here?

790
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,920
My friend brought me
some local food from his hometown

791
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,720
and I want to share it with you guys

792
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,440
for a taste.

793
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
OK. Go.

794
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Come to my home.

795
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,240
OK.

796
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,600
- Let's go.
- Come.

797
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,600
Here. Have some water.

798
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,160
Chunsheng,

799
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,360
how's your work at the Customs?

800
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,840
Good.

801
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,280
Hongjun looks out for me.

802
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,520
Heizi,

803
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,710
did you come for something?

804
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
We've been friends for years.

805
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,630
I'm not as close to you as Tian,

806
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,630
but if you need any help,

807
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,840
you can get to the point.

808
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,230
Unless it's illegal,

809
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I'll do my best to help.

810
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,230
It's not illegal.

811
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,760
Umm, I have some goods

812
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
that were detained by the Customs.

813
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,760
I wonder

814
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,670
if you can help me ask about it

815
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,630
and get some information.

816
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
What goods?

817
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Some goods from Hong Kong, China.

818
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,280
I used to import them

819
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,190
and nothing happened.

820
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,000
But they're somehow detained this time.

821
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,670
That's it?

822
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,600
Yes.

823
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,150
I was just informed.

824
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,080
Fine. I'll ask about it for you.

825
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
If the goods are clean,

826
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll tell them to let it go.

827
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,360
Thank you so much, Chunsheng.

828
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,200
Sorry for the trouble.

829
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,320
Please ask about it for me.

830
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
- It's OK. My pleasure.
- Thanks. Thanks.

831
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,360
Well,

832
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,320
you're just off work.

833
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Go take some rest.

834
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,240
I won't disturb you.

835
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,880
I should go.

836
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Heizi.

837
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,720
Take this back.

838
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,160
No, no.

839
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,240
I brought it for you.

840
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,840
Take it!

841
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,600
But...

842
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
When you need something,

843
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,240
just let me know.

844
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,600
Friends like us don't need presents.

845
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
I'll ask about the case for you.

846
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,920
Don't worry.

847
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,720
It's no big deal.

848
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,480
Just do your business with no concern.

849
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,320
Chunsheng,

850
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,480
I really appreciate your help.

851
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,080
My men and I

852
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,840
spent all our money on these goods.

853
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,160
It also included

854
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,240
Xiaohui's money.

855
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
I think if I can get the money back

856
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
and if I can see her again,

857
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,920
I want to return the money.

858
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,160
Rest assured.

859
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,860
(Serve the People)

860
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,360
Why are you still practicing?

861
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,440
However hard you practice,

862
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,360
it'll be the last performance.

863
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
Even if it's the last performance,

864
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,520
I'll still do my best.

865
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,920
(Develop art activities to consolidate
the socialist ideological front)

866
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,040
To tell you something from my heart,

867
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
I don't want to leave the army, either.

868
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
After staying here for years,

869
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,280
I have feelings for it.

870
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,480
You're offered a promotion
in Chengdu Military Region.

871
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,680
Then why do you not go?

872
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,760
Didn't I tell you?

873
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,040
I've got my own plan.

874
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,240
Besides, my parents

875
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,480
cleaned out our room in Beijing.

876
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,560
And you've been in poor health.

877
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,760
Go back with me for recuperation.

878
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,720
Anyway,

879
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,120
you just don't want to stay

880
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,160
or help me to stay.

881
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
What could I do, then?

882
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,040
Apply for your transfer

883
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
and go back to Beijing alone?

884
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
How would we continue our life?

885
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,760
I don't want to argue over this now.

886
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,560
All I want is to give
a perfect performance.

887
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,560
Hongling,

888
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
we're a couple.

889
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,040
Before you have a request,

890
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,000
shouldn't you think about me, too?

891
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
I told you many times.

892
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,000
This is an irreversible wave of destiny.

893
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
When we do some other jobs,

894
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,040
we can still make achievements.

895
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,880
Don't change the subject.

896
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
You just want to return and make money.

897
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
You're distracted.

898
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,120
Am I that kind of man
who only wants money?

899
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,120
I just want to prove to others

900
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,040
that I won't be worse than anyone
in doing anything!

901
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,280
I know.

902
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,960
Here, you're a backbone performer.

903
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,160
You think you can develop better

904
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,640
and you're not sure
about a good job out of the army.

905
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,720
How about this?

906
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,120
Back in Beijing,

907
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,760
I'll contact more orchestras for you.

908
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,320
You just want to play the violin, right?

909
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
Then take the exams and interviews.

910
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,000
Considering your skills,
you can play anywhere.

911
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,800
Anyway, you can't stay in the army.

912
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,200
Why must you be so stubborn?

913
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,240
I'm not being stubborn.

914
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
This is the last performance.

915
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,080
No matter what,

916
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,040
I have to do my best for the last time.

917
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,160
Whatever.

918
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,520
I've submitted the report.

919
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
By then, you'll have to

920
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,040
return to Beijing with me.

921
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,560
Hongling,

922
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,080
Beijing is our hometown

923
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,600
where we come from.

924
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Going back there is good for both of us.

925
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,240
Hello.

926
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,320
May I speak to Liu of the warehouse?

927
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,800
Hello.

928
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Who's that speaking?

929
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,520
Liu,

930
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,200
it's me, Chunsheng.

931
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,480
Chief, what's up?

932
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,320
Here's the thing.

933
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
A friend of mine

934
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,800
had some goods

935
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,280
detained at the Customs.

936
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,520
May I have you

937
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,160
to check it out for me?

938
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,040
OK. I'm on it.

939
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,760
What's your friend's name?

940
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,440
Guo Heizi.

941
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,920
Chief, his case is a little bit tough.

942
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,600
What do you mean, Liu?

943
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
It's smuggling.

944
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,600
Chief, you should stay out of this.

945
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,040
Fine. I get it.

946
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,760
Thank you, Liu.

947
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,400
My pleasure.

948
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,600
Heizi.

949
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,000
Let me ask you something.

950
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,440
How long have you been doing this?

951
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,840
Chunsheng, I... I don't understand.

952
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,760
Doing what?

953
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,440
Oh, cigarettes from Hong Kong, China.
Quite rare in Chinese mainland.

954
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,080
33 boxes of Marlboro.

955
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,120
Equivalent to 130,000 yuan.

956
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,800
Do you know how many years
you'll be in prison?

957
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,560
Heizi,

958
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
what were you thinking?

959
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,560
You were nearly arrested
for foreign exchange certificates.

960
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
Why didn't you learn your lesson?

961
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,920
Will you not stop

962
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,640
until you're in prison?

963
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,560
Why can't you

964
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,120
just live a simple life?

965
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,840
What do you mean by a simple life?

966
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
Like Tian,

967
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,760
who makes a little money

968
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,920
from his store?

969
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
He eats and sleeps simply

970
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
and lives with his wife.

971
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,280
Then he'll have
good-for-nothing children.

972
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Is that a simple life?

973
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,000
But my wife is gone.
I have no wife now.

974
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,520
Chunsheng,

975
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
you were born

976
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,080
in a very good family.

977
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,160
You don't know

978
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,840
what price we have to pay

979
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,040
for improving our status,
even a little bit.

980
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,360
You have no idea.

981
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,280
Heizi,

982
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,040
I know you're defiant at us.

983
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,520
You think we're rich young men

984
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,680
who take things for nothing.

985
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm not sure about others.

986
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,640
But I've lived my life

987
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,480
step by step

988
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
and one day at a time.

989
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
So, I think I'm qualified

990
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,080
to tell you this.

991
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
There are no shortcuts in life.

992
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200
Only when we make money
through hard work

993
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,080
can we live a steady life

994
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,640
and be a decent man.
