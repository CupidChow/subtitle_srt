3
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Mr. Ye.

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,040
I know what happened.

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,030
So, you came here

6
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
to laugh at me, right?

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
Mr. Xiao, now that

8
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,720
you know what happened,

9
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,600
I won't bother to entertain you.

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Guohua,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,640
I came to help you.

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,960
Help me?

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,040
Fine.

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
You win.

15
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,720
I admit

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,840
that you're the most successful

17
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
and the best man.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm always inferior to you, OK?

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Stop gibbering.

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,440
Look.

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,520
What's the difference?

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
You can't tell, huh?

23
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Be professional, OK?

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,600
I do foreign trade, not technology.

25
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,640
This is

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
our drawing.

27
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,960
And this one is Li Shangyou's.

28
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Only the core components are different.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
So, they have different qualities.

30
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,040
My engineers

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,960
have been working on the problem

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
that core components are
sometimes unstable

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,320
and haven't solved it until recently.

34
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,800
That's why

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
I dared to take your order.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,760
And of course,

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,640
this research has been confidential.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
So Heizi didn't know

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
what he gave Li Shangyou

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,320
wasn't the latest one.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
I can take this order

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,880
and have all core components replaced

43
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
to meet international requirements.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,280
Will this work?

45
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,160
Have I ever failed you once?

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
No, never.

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,400
Chunsheng,

48
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,840
why do you still help me?

49
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
Because you're my buddy.

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
My best buddy.

51
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,160
Do you trust me?

52
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
It's not time to celebrate yet.

53
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,960
I have one condition.

54
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,520
Tell me.

55
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Chunsheng,

56
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
will you really take Ye Guohua's order?

57
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
That's quite a big one.

58
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,680
Products for Nanjing
will be delivered by the end of March.

59
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,960
Products for Southeast Asia, April.

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,880
Let's do this, Tian.

61
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
Postpone these two batches

62
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,280
until the Spring Festival is over.

63
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
Spare one production line

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
for the machines for Huasheng.

65
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,000
Fine.

66
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,520
Now that you promised him,

67
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,800
I won't argue.

68
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,920
You're helpful

69
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,240
and I won't drag you down.

70
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,120
But you have to

71
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,080
promise me one thing.

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840
Speak.

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,040
He must pay the market price.

74
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
We can't lose money.

75
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
My workers

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
can't work for nothing.

77
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,320
OK.

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,720
They won't work for nothing.

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,600
What's more,

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
let's give them a big bonus
by the end of the year.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,600
What do you think?

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
OK. It's a deal, then.

83
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,780
(Chunxiao Health Care)

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Be careful.

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,880
Careful.

86
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Tian,

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
what's wrong with everybody?

88
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,720
They look unwell.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,080
Are they sick?

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
No idea.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Today, Cai even asked for leave,
saying he had a cold.

92
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
He's a strong man

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
and exercises every day.

94
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
But a cold got him down.

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,160
- Everyone's working hard lately.
- Come on, give me a hand.

96
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
It's normal that they get weaker.

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,640
It's OK.

98
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,520
I'll have someone
buy some medicine for flu

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,720
and make do with these days.

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,840
You can't do that.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,760
What if they feel unwell

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
and get hurt when moving things?

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,640
How about this?

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
Have them go to the hospital for a check.

105
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,240
They can't.

106
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,600
Time is pressing for too much work.

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,880
With fewer men,
we can't complete the mission.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Chunsheng.

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,880
Chunsheng.

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
How about you mobilize them

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
to work during the Spring Festival?

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,600
No way.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,080
Any festival will do,
except the Spring Festival.

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,320
Think about it.

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,640
Workers work for the whole year

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,600
just to get back to their families

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,560
and enjoy a happy festival together.

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
You're right.

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,840
But our production...

120
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,400
Tian,

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
it's no hurry for a couple of days.

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Well,

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
the customs declaration
will take some days.

124
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,360
Give our workers a big bonus

125
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
and let them enjoy a good festival.

126
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,560
It's really generous of you.

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't make fun of me.

128
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm a small businessman,

129
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
not a capitalist.

130
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,420
(Police)

131
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,440
Xiaohui?

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Long time no see.

133
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,760
Li Shangyou didn't hurt you, did he?

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,240
Over all these years,

135
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
you haven't got
even a little bit smarter.

136
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Don't be silly.

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
What kind of man is Li Shangyou?

138
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
How could you trust him?

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
How did you know this?

140
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,560
Yanqiu told me.

141
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,320
Actually, in the past few years,

142
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
we've been in touch.

143
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Li Shangyou threatened me
with your life.

144
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
I hurt you really a lot

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,840
and I can't let anyone else hurt you.

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,560
Come on.

147
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Now, you've realized it?

148
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
But what did you do?

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,800
I've lived most of my life

150
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,000
(Silence)
and now I know I've done a lot wrong.

151
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,600
It's been years

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,960
and I've wanted to apologize.

153
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
I want to say sorry.

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
But I didn't find you.

155
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
And I didn't expect

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
that I could see you again.

157
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Heizi,

158
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,280
behave yourself in jail.

159
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,520
Try to come out early.

160
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,080
And then,
come to Hong Kong, China for me.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,720
I'll be waiting.

162
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Tian,

163
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
drive me to the airport, please.

164
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,920
Leaving already?

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,480
Chunsheng.

166
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,360
Get up. Take off your clothes

167
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
and have a bath before you sleep.

168
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,480
Come on.

169
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,440
Xiaomei,

170
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm OK.

171
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
Let me lie for a moment.

172
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,120
Chunsheng,

173
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,280
you need some rest.

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,440
For production,

175
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Tian and his men are watching.

176
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,360
You don't need to worry that much.

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Guohua's products

178
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,000
were finally returned from the Customs.

179
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,760
New products are in urgent need.

180
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,000
I have to ask my workers

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,480
to work overtime.

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
Everything's finally back
on the right path

183
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
and nothing can go wrong again.

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,600
Xiaomei,

185
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,240
wait until the Spring Festival.

186
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,080
Then I'll spend more time
with you and Beibei.

187
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
It's OK

188
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,480
that you have no time for us.

189
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,080
I just worry about your health.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Chunsheng,

191
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
listen to me and go back for some rest.

192
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
Tian, the products for Guohua

193
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
are going through the customs declaration.

194
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,280
It'll be approved soon.

195
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,920
Check this.

196
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,480
I know.

197
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,960
Our new production line

198
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,240
has been functioning day and night.

199
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,320
Don't... Don't worry.
I'll stay and watch.

200
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
You haven't slept
for two days and nights.

201
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,920
Go get some sleep.

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
It's OK. I'm fine.

203
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,280
There you are, Xiaomei.

204
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Xiaomei, what did you come for?

205
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
If I still didn't come,

206
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,920
someone would even be
too busy to have lunch.

207
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,400
You think no one can restrain you, huh?

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Extra food for you.

209
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,200
Dumplings I made.

210
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
Taste some.

211
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh, extra food?

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,600
Xiaomei is busy at work

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
and it's rare for us

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,280
to taste her dumplings.

215
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,280
Dr. Tong has limited energy.

216
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,880
She spared some time for the dumplings

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,840
and do cherish them.

218
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,760
Don't worry, Dr. Tong.

219
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,000
Based on the current producing pace,

220
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,080
products for Guohua will be done soon.

221
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
Warm tip from Dr. Tong.

222
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,680
When it's lunchtime, have lunch

223
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,760
instead of talking about work.

224
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
Eat the dumplings. Or they'll get cold.

225
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,400
Some vinegar is in it.

226
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,040
It is?

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Tian,

228
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,120
do you remember back in the stack room,

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Xiaomei's shout scared me so much

230
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,200
that I didn't finish my dumplings.

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,760
I heard about that.

232
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
The secret girl in the stack room.

233
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Exactly.

234
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Come on. Don't make fun of me.

235
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Go. Go have lunch.

236
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,440
Let's go for the dumplings.

237
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
OK, go.

238
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,060
(Chinese New Year,
Happy Chinese New Year!)

239
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,700
(Nice wish, Fortune)

240
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,820
(Chinese Red
Good Luck and Happiness)

241
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,060
(Wealth and Safety, Fortune)

242
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,320
Come on, Yanqiu.

243
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
- Hurry. Come in.
- Aunt.

244
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,400
- There you are.
- Come on.

245
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
- Waiting for us?
- Leave your overcoats to me.

246
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,920
Come on. Leave them to me.

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Thank you.

248
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,440
Aunt,

249
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
my mother just wondered

250
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,720
why the cook hadn't come yet.

251
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,600
I want Shredded Pork with Bean Sauce.

252
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,080
No problem.

253
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,720
My mother cooks much worse.

254
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,520
Then why did you eat that much?

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,720
Come on, Tian.

256
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,520
Yanqiu.

257
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Why did you bring so many things?

258
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,120
Yanqiu, Tian,

259
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,160
it's so kind of you.

260
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,560
- Leave it to me.
- You're welcome.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,520
Qi Miao,

262
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,560
here.

263
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,120
Lucky money from your uncle.

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
Wish you success
in the college entrance exam.

265
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,840
Thank you, Aunt.

266
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Thank you, Uncle.

267
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,560
You're welcome.

268
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,600
Study hard.

269
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,480
- Come on.
- Don't stand here.

270
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Get in.

271
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,760
Come in and seat.

272
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
Come on, Tian.

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,360
OK.

274
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,120
Chunsheng.

275
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,520
Happy Spring Festival!

276
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
The same to you.

277
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Happy Spring Festival, Chunsheng!

278
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,960
Come on in.

279
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Tian is in there.

280
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,120
Leave it to me.

281
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
So many presents. Thanks.

282
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,360
Fang, only you two came?

283
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,480
What about your sister-in-law?

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,440
After the Spring Festival,

285
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,120
it's hard to tell
if she's still my sister-in-law.

286
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,680
She wanted a divorce.

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
He was too cowardly to accept it.

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,560
All right. Come on in.

289
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't stand here.

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,960
Chef,

291
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
thank you for the cooking.

292
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
Don't say that.

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,160
Are you used to living with your parents?

294
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,200
Not bad.

295
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,080
They feel happy.

296
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,400
I don't want to go back to that flat.

297
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
But it's a waste to keep it vacant.

298
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
So, I'm gonna sell it.

299
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
You look very good recently.

300
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,040
As the old saying goes,

301
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,960
people don't keep three things in mind.

302
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,880
Sorrow of the past.

303
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,560
Hatred of yesterday.

304
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,920
And regret of old times.

305
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
I used to be confused about something,

306
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,120
but now I gradually figure it out.

307
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,640
Many things don't need
to be bothered about.

308
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
With less worry, I can live longer.

309
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Good, Prof. Ye.

310
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
It's still conscious of you.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,480
Having a problem against myself,

312
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,240
against someone else,

313
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
or against all people

314
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,480
can't be the right thing.

315
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Dr. Tong, do I make sense?

316
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
Yes.

317
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
In life,

318
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,520
we know a lot of senses,

319
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,480
but it's still hard to live well.

320
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Fang,

321
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,200
I just want you to be really happy

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
and find your Mr. Right soon.

323
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,440
Which one?

324
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,400
- Beibei, pick one.
- Which hand is it in?

325
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,800
This one?

326
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
- Pick one.
- This.

327
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,160
Well, this one.

328
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,960
Which?

329
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,830
Trust me. This one.

330
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,240
This.

331
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,070
You cheated!

332
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
All right. You won, girls.

333
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,920
Here you are.

334
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Have fun with Ms. Fang.

335
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,160
Come on.

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,640
Chunsheng.

337
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,000
Which hand is it in?

338
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
- This?
- This.

339
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,240
Pick this.

340
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,400
This.

341
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,320
This one.

342
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,320
- Wrong hand.
- I won.

343
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Here. Take this.

344
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,520
What's wrong?

345
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,640
One more round?

346
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:42,960
Come on.

348
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,480
You have a big family.

349
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,320
- This.
- This.

350
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
Really lively.

351
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,680
- Feels good.
- It's so clever of you.

352
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,600
Which hand is it in?

353
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,640
This.

354
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
One more round.

355
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah. A happy family.

356
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,000
You came alone.

357
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,280
What about Hongling?

358
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,000
She's home alone, I guess.

359
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
Come on, dude.

360
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,400
You left your wife at home alone
during the Spring Festival.

361
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,920
Oh, Dad,

362
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,800
how about we go out for a walk?

363
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,800
OK. We can go.

364
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,840
Well,

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
put on your clothes and we'll go.

366
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Here we go.

367
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,400
- Go.
- Sure.

368
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,920
OK.

369
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,160
- Take a coat, Beibei.
- Let's go for a walk.

370
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,720
I get it.

371
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,160
Go.

372
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,840
How about this?

373
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,560
Call Hongling.

374
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,960
Anyway,

375
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,120
it's the Spring Festival.

376
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,880
You shouldn't leave her home alone.

377
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,580
(Calling from Guohua)

378
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,800
What?

379
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,440
She didn't answer.

380
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,440
Forget about her.

381
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,400
Let's take a walk alone.

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,480
Don't.

383
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
Let's go and pick her up.

384
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,240
She's not far.

385
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,880
Go.

386
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
Don't move, baby.

387
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,520
The man I introduced to you,

388
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,440
when will you meet him?

389
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,120
Yanqiu,

390
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
why do you bring him up at the festival?

391
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,520
It's the festival of reunion,

392
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,840
so I brought this up.

393
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,440
Go meet him. You won't lose anything.

394
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,960
I don't really want to go.

395
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,840
Come on.

396
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,920
Beibei,

397
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,320
don't eat too much sweet food.

398
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
Or sugar will rot your teeth.

399
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,600
It's OK.

400
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,400
It's the festival, after all. Let her be.

401
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,040
- It's OK. Enjoy it.
- You're the best, Dad.

402
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,400

I still remember I first met you

when I was on a bus.

474
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,960
Other passengers were saying,

475
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,000
"Look.

476
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,680
A young man is riding after the bus."

477
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
I looked back at you.

478
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,320
When you fell off your bike,

479
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,680
you still waved at me.

480
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,200
Actually, that day,

481
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,240
I was delighted.

482
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
Because you met a young man

483
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,760
who seemed to be dumb.

484
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,240
Because for the first time,

485
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,640
I saw someone love me that much.

486
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,600
Hongling,

487
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,680
I saw a gray hair on your head.

488
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,680
Where? Rip it out.

489
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
Comrade He Hongling,

490
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,800
we should face our aging calmly.

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
We're in our forties, after all.

492
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,160
Don't say that.

493
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,520
Why not?

494
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,080

495
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,440
Fine, fine. I'll stop.

496
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,400
I'll say no more.

497
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,960
Hongling,

498
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,920
do you think we can

499
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,120
get back together?

500
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,040
Guohua,

501
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
I've made up my mind.

502
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Listen, Hongling.

503
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,560
I was terrible

504
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,600
and narrow-minded.

505
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,480
You can't have had an affair
with Xiao Chunsheng.

506
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,800
He isn't that kind of guy.

507
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,360
Nor are you.

508
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
I just feel inferior.

509
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,760
I think wherever Chunsheng is,

510
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,200
you wouldn't pick me.

511
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,520
Guohua, that's not true.

512
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,840
I feel inferior, too.

513
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
It must be hard to love

514
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,160
someone like me, right?

515
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,520
I not only feel inferior

516
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
but also am contradictious and selfish.

517
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,320
I always love myself the most.

518
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,080
That year,

519
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,160
I was obsessed
with the ideal love from Chunsheng

520
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,560
and meanwhile,

521
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,160
I wanted a stable life from you.

522
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,320
Actually,

523
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,920
I gave up my love for reality,

524
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,920
but I acted like a victim.

525
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,880
I blamed Chunsheng.

526
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,400
I blamed you, too.

527
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
As if someone forced me

528
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,040
to make that choice.

529
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,480
Don't say that.

530
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I know.

531
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Even if I went back
to Beijing with Chunsheng,

532
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
we wouldn't end up very well.

533
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,360
I would blame him
for letting me give up

534
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,920
my job promotion,

535
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,640
my dream,

536
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,240
and also

537
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,760
another kind of stable life.

538
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,120
Xiao Chunsheng and I were done.

539
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,040
Since the moment
he chose Tong Xiaomei,

540
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,120
he had nothing to do with me.

541
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,240
After all, a woman like me

542
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,760
would only love someone who loves me.

543
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,800
See? I'm just this kind of woman,

544
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,920
very selfish.

545
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,920
Hongling,

546
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
I don't care if you're selfish

547
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,240
or snobbish.

548
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,240
Whatever kind of woman you are,

549
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,040
I always love you.

550
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
As long as you're by my side,

551
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll be delighted.

552
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,880
Over all these years,

553
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
only you, Ye Guohua,

554
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
have seen the real me,

555
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,320
selfish but true.

556
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,080
And I would tell my true feelings

557
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
to no one except you.

558
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,760
In front of you, I've been dramatic
without worrying.

559
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,960
But even in this case,

560
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,800
you still

561
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,280
tolerate me and love me.

562
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,640
I once read a foreign essay.

563
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
It said,

564
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,760
only true love could make us feel secure.

565
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,160
Maybe in this sense,

566
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,240
I truly love you.

567
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,120
But I got to understand this

568
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,400
too late.

569
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,600
When Beibei took the photo with us,

570
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
I felt it was like a dream.

571
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,320
Our baby...

572
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,760
Over the years,

573
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
I know you've blamed me for that.

574
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,560
You never said it out, though.

575
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,120
I blame myself, too.

576
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
- If I hadn't been that competitive...
- No.

577
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,080
Hongling.

578
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
No. It wasn't your fault.

579
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,480
After all, if I hadn't

580
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,720
forced you to leave the army,

581
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
you needn't have had a new start

582
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
in a strange orchestra.

583
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,880
And you needn't have practiced that hard

584
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,400
just to get a firm foothold.

585
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,440
Then...

586
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,320
It wasn't your fault.

587
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,000
I was terrible and selfish.

588
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,760
You're not to blame.

589
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,720
Guohua,

590
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
I know

591
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,360
I had to leave the army

592
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,520
that year.

593
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
In my life,

594
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,720
I was willing to marry you

595
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
and have lived with you.

596
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,360
Think about it.

597
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,480
If our baby had lived,

598
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,000
could we also be as happy

599
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,200
as Chunsheng and Xiaomei?

600
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,560
Or maybe,

601
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
if we had this talk earlier,

602
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,520
we wouldn't end up like this.

603
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,760
Guohua,

604
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
if your company failed to survive,

605
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
I wouldn't force you to divorce me.

606
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,160
But your problem has been solved.

607
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,800
Time for me to leave.

608
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Comrade Ye Guohua,

609
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,280
let's break up.

610
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,240
Wish you a happy life.

611
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,520
And I'm going to get back the old me

612
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,680
who is pure and ideal

613
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,440
with enthusiasm for music.

614
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,520
(He Hongling chose to take
further music education in Paris.)

615
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,040
(At last, she left Shichahai,
where she was restrained,)

616
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,820
(China Eastern)

617
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,560
(and flew to somewhere bigger)

618
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,120
(for her unrealized dream.)

619
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,040
Mrs. Cai.

620
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,600
Cai.

621
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,840
Don't.

622
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,720
Don't.

623
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,840
Just lie down there.

624
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,320
How do you feel?

625
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,680
Any better?

626
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,600
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Xiao.

627
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,840
Much better.

628
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,040
I had the injection and slept.

629
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,440
Now, my fever is gone.

630
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
I asked the doctor.

631
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,680
You have common flu

632
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,800
and it's not serious.

633
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,320
Maybe you've been working too hard

634
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,640
and have got weaker.

635
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,280
Rest for a few days and you'll be fine.

636
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
I can't rest.

637
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,880
I have to go back to work.

638
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,120
A lot of work needs to be done.

639
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Cai,

640
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,160
don't worry about the work.

641
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,840
Stay here for recuperation.

642
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,240
No work until you recover.

643
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,840
OK.

644
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,760
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

645
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,400
Mrs. Cai,

646
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,440
this is the bonus for his overtime work
before the Spring Festival.

647
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,080
I brought it with me.

648
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,440
If you still have some difficulties,

649
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,640
let me know.

650
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,760
Thank you.

651
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,840
Thank you for caring.

652
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,280
- My pleasure.
- Thanks.

653
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,520
We won't disturb you, then.

654
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,480
Have some rest.

655
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,520
OK.

656
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,760
Cai, Mrs. Cai,

657
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
we should go.

658
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,360
Rest without concern.

659
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,080
Lie back there.

660
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,800
Have some good rest.

661
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Look.

662
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,360
It's kind of them.

663
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,920
Indeed.

664
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,880
Doctor, how's Cai?

665
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,680
Now, he has intrapulmonary effusion

666
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
and diffuse alveolar injury.

667
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,440
His situation is serious.

668
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,320
Doctor.

669
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,040
Why does he have a lung infection?

670
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,040
Recently, a lot of patients
have a lung infection.

671
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Our hospital takes count of this.

672
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,480
Yesterday, our director
had a meeting for therapies.

673
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,920
Don't be too nervous now.

674
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,340
(Production Schedule
for February and March)

675
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,480
(Production Schedule)

676
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
April's products for Southeast Asia

677
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
have to be delivered soon.

678
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,120
You must hurry up.

679
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,190
Hurry up.

680
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,320
Mr. Qi,

681
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,920
our warehouse

682
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
is nearly piled.

683
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,080
If we produce so many products,

684
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,360
we'll have nowhere to store them.

685
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
Don't be kidding.

686
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,560
What's still in store?

687
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Machines for Huasheng.

688
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,600
Before the Spring Festival,

689
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,320
we worked overtime so hard.

690
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,190
And we finally finished the order.

691
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,440
Why are the machines stored in the dust?

692
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll go ask Mr. Xiao.

693
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,920
What on earth is Ye Guohua doing?

694
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,670
Chunsheng,

695
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,710
how's Guohua handling that?

696
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,670
Has he got the approval of the Customs?

697
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
What's wrong?

698
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,960
The Customs declaration
hasn't been approved yet.

699
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,520
But it usually takes

700
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,240
a day or two, doesn't it?

701
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,640
It's been over a month.

702
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,680
Is Chen Hongjun

703
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,200
doing some dirty tricks?

704
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,200
I went to see him.

705
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,640
But his secretary said
he was either in a meeting

706
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
or on a business trip.

707
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,600
I didn't even manage to see him.

708
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
What do we do, then?

709
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,800
Time is pressing for David's order.

710
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,440
Ignoring the shipping period,

711
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,720
we have only a few days available.

712
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,080
Isn't it obvious?

713
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
Chen Hongjun colludes

714
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,360
with Li Shangyou to set us up.

715
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,880
Will we just swallow this?

716
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,920
Say something, Chunsheng!

717
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,560
Chen Hongjun is the director
of the Customs.

718
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,920
We can't avoid him,
whatever we want to export.

719
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,320
Even if we want to go
through other Customs,

720
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,880
we can't start the declaration

721
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
until he dismisses this one.

722
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,000
So, we worked overtime

723
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,880
day and night,

724
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,240
and it's just wasted?

725
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,640
Tian,

726
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,200
calm down.

727
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,480
It's urgent. Don't keep me guessing.

728
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,360
Chunsheng, it's a critical moment.

729
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,360
You can't still be thinking
he's our best buddy, huh?

730
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,000
He's no longer

731
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,520
the Chen Hongjun we used to know.

732
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,120
Now,

733
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,960
he's a vermin in our government

734
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
thoroughly corroded by capitalism.

735
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,520
Our brotherhood is gone.

736
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,680
If he continues like this,

737
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,400
he'll be in big trouble!

738
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,600
Let's think hard

739
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,640
about how we can solve this problem.

740
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,240
Did you check
Hongjun's transactions and assets

741
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,920
because you were once worried?

742
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,880
In the past years,

743
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,640
I failed to supervise him.

744
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,800
You're not to blame.

745
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,240
You were his wife,

746
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,040
not his mother.

747
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
Even his mother

748
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
couldn't bother
when he was in his forties.

749
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,480
Over all these years,

750
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,160
he's been having a smooth career.

751
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,320
The higher he gets,

752
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,920
the higher he wants to be.

753
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,240
And the more he gets, the more he wants.

754
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Sometimes, I think,

755
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
if I had stopped him resolutely

756
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,600
when he made the first mistake,

757
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,040
maybe he wouldn't have gone this far.

758
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,880
Fang,

759
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,680
I know

760
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
we're giving you a big problem.

761
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,960
But the choice is yours.

762
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,280
Whatever decision you make,

763
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,480
we'll understand and support you.

764
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,720
(After struggling,)

765
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,920
(Ye Fang finally decided)

766
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
(to make the evidence public)

767
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,040
(that kept her worried for years.)

768
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,260
(Discipline Inspection and Supervision)

769
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Chen Hongjun,

770
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,760
we received a real-name reporting

771
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,000
against your embezzlement,
bribery and abuse of power.

772
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,640
Please go with us.

773
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,800
What's going on?

774
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,720
Discipline Inspection got a report
and will investigate him.

775
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,280
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

776
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,160
Bad news!

777
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,040
Don't panic.

778
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,560
Our company hasn't collapsed yet.

779
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
We're in big trouble!

780
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Someone reported you.

781
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,600
You're Li Shangyou, huh?

782
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,320
Yes, I am.

783
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
Officer, what's up?

784
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,820
(Police Badge)

785
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,440
Someone reported
that you and Chen Hongjun

786
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,320
had corruption and sexual bribery.

787
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,640
And under his shield,

788
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,080
you did a large amount
of illegal smuggling.

789
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,760
Now, please go with us

790
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,400
and assist in our related investigation.

791
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,320
Hope you'll cooperate.

792
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,240
Officer,

793
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,000
there must be some misunderstanding.

794
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,080
I'm always a law-abiding man.

795
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,640
If you don't have evidence,

796
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,000
you can't just arrest me.

797
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,440
Take him away.

798
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,320
Come on.

799
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,480
You can't...

800
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,320
You can't take me away just like this!

801
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,320
You...

802
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,600
Officer.

803
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,920
Doctor!

804
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,160
- Come, doctor!
- Doctor!

805
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,440
Come, doctor!

806
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,360
Doctor!

807
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,240
He passed out!

808
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,580
(Nurse Station)

809
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
Dr. Tong.

810
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
How's Cai?

811
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,600
The doctor is saving him.

812
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
Director Tao, personally.

813
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,440
Cai just had flu.

814
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,200
When I visited him last time,

815
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,680
he was refreshed.

816
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,200
Why is he suddenly so serious?

817
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,880
We're not sure yet.

818
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,800
Over the two days,

819
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,320
we've received a few more
pneumonia patients.

820
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,640
By the way,

821
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,480
the other day,
we had a pneumonia patient.

822
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,960
Has he transferred to Ward No. 301?

823
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,880
Yes.

824
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,480
Hello.

825
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,560
Chunsheng,

826
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,120
the situation is urgent.

827
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,920
Put aside what you're doing

828
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,000
and hear me out.

829
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,400
A second, please.

830
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,920
Tian, I have to take this call.

831
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,560
Xiaomei, go on.

832
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
Cai suddenly got sicker.

833
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,840
First organ failure, and then a coma.

834
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,160
Wait. What's going on?

835
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,880
How did that happen?

836
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,840
Cai isn't the only patient.

837
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,240
After he stayed in the hospital,

838
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
two other patients in his ward

839
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,960
had similar symptoms.

840
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,720
So, this disease is infectious.

841
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,880
His CT looks bad, too.

842
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,400
It's a completely different disease.

843
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,160
Isn't that just common flu?

844
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,200
It's not common flu.

845
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,440
The hospital preliminarily believes

846
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,640
it's a new infectious disease.

847
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,040
Before Cai was sent here,

848
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,000
you were handing out bonus
in the workshop.

849
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,200
The workshop was confined and crowded.

850
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,720
I'm afraid the situation is bad.

851
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,280
Hurry and get your workers quarantined.

852
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,440
Isolated?

853
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,280
All of us?

854
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,280
Yes, you have to do this.

855
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,760
This is a dangerous situation.
