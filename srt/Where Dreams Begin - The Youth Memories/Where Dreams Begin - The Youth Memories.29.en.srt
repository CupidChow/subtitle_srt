3
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
There are no shortcuts in life.

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,120
Only when we make money
through hard work

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,000
can we live a steady life

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
and be a decent man.

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,960
And you said Tian made a little money

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
and would raise
good-for-nothing children.

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't agree.

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,240
Indeed, life is still hard now.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,480
But I think

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,640
it gives everyone the chance to improve.

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,840
People no longer judge you

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
upon your class, family, or origin.

15
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,440
Instead, your ability matters.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
You can study,

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,680
work,

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
make money,

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
and do business.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
As long as you work hard,

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,040
you'll find the most suitable position.

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,360
Heizi,

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,640
you have mere smartness.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,840
But it will bring harm to you.

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
Leave those goods at the Customs.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800

27

Tian doesn't know this yet.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't tell him, OK?

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,240

Stop looking. Go.

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,520
Let me stay for a little longer.

35
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
It's gone, anyway.

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,080
Since little, I've been jealous
of people like you

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
who could wear military uniforms.

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
You wear the uniforms

39
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
and people respect you.

40
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
Since the day

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
I knew I could also wear it,

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,800
I had been too excited to sleep for days.

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,760
You couldn't understand

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,560
how it felt to have
a sense of belonging.

45
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
Every day when I played the violin here,

46
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I cried and laughed.

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,360
I was criticized.

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,360
I was recognized, too.

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,920
But now, it's suddenly gone.

50
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,440
I feel like I lost my home.

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
Why would you lose your home?

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
My home is yours, too.

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,600
That's different.

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,400

you are incompetent,

66

I don't care about what they say.

67
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,480

Yeah.

80
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720

00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
Stay healthy.

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
Don't get too tired.

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,560
You know what?

117
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Hongluo Temple in Huairou
is very efficacious.

118
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,880
My sister-in-law went there
for praying last year.

119
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,840
And last month, she gave birth to a boy.

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
It's good to have a son.

121
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,480
In case no one takes care of you
when you're old.

122
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,680
Now, sons and daughters are the same.

123

How much?

124
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Two yuan.

125
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,320
Here.

126
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,320
OK.

127
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
One more for you.

128
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
OK. Thanks.

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,560
OK.

136
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,200
There you are.

137
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes, Tian.

138
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,560
Taking stock?

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,640
Still no word of Xiaohui?

140
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,240
No.

141
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
I don't mean to blame you.

142
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,320
But you really did the wrong thing.

143
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,640
Xiaohui is a pretty girl

144
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
and she likes to be dressed up.

145
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,600
It's normal that men flirt with her.

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Don't be so narrow-minded
or suspect her.

147
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
She loves you only.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,160
And it's no longer a feudal society.

149
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,400
What's the problem with being a model?

150
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,160
That's fashionable.

151
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,120
Besides,

152
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,480
she can earn some money for your family.

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Come on, I don't even have a family now.

154
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,400
Tian, let's drop this topic.

155
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,440
A real man should let it go,

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
right?

157
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,360
But I can't.

158
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
You have to, anyway!

159
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,160
You must live your life seriously.

160
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
Then when Xiaohui comes back,

161
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,120
you'll be able to make it up to her.

162
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,880
What about the tobacco?

163
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm running out of it.

164
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh, well...

165
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,200
The tobacco...

166
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Tian, wait for a few more days.

167
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm having a little problem now.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,560
Right.

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,600
No one can be a billionaire overnight.

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,360
We have to make money little by little.

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,240
What's wrong?

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:17,920
Nothing.

173
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,840
Tell me.

174
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,800
No... nothing.

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm OK. You go on with this.

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,080
I should go.

177
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
Are you sure you're OK?

178
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,360
Yes, yes.

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Get back to your business.

180
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm leaving, Tian. Bye.

181
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,680
Stay safe.

182
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,080
Bye.

183
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
Why is the account wrong?

184
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,860
(Day and Night Shop)

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,920
Heizi,

186
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,520
what did Tian say?

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Heizi,

188
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
you didn't tell him, huh?

189
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
Heizi!

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,120
That's the vital money for Cap.

191
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,640
To get enough money for the goods,

192
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
he took some from a loan shark.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,200
Now, the goods are detained

194
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,440
and he couldn't pay the debt.

195
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
He was already beaten up.

196
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
And they said,

197
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,880
it was a slight punishment.

198
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
If he still can't pay the debt,

199
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,520
he'll have to lose his hand.

200
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,280
Come on, Heizi.

201
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll go tell Tian.

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,400
It's OK. It's OK.

203
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,040
Calm down.

204
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,520
But, Heizi, you...

205
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
Don't disturb Tian.

206
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,320
I'll think of a way.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
But Cap...

208
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,640
I'll take care of it.

209
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Sir, who do you want?

210
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Xiao Chunsheng.

211
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,800
He's my best buddy.

212
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,040
What do you want Chief Xiao for?

213
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,280
Nothing.

214
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,480
Just some family stuff.

215
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
OK. Wait here.

216
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,720
I'll go get him to you.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,640
Oh, wait.

218
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
It's OK. Don't bother to go.

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,040
No big deal.

220
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Everyone here seems to be busy.

221
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,200
I won't trouble you.

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,640
I'll wait here until he knocks off.

223
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,680
Thanks, anyway. Thank you.

226

Director Chen.

227
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,200
When I saw you from behind,

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,760
I felt familiar.

229
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,160
So, it's really you.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,760
What are you doing here?

231
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,520
I do want you

232
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
to do me a favor.

233
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,240
Let's talk later.

234
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,040
I have some business to do
and I'm quite busy.

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,560
Come on, Director Chen.

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,440
No time like the present.

237
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
I haven't had dinner yet.

238
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,600
You know what?

239
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Whenever I feel hungry,

240
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
my wound... See?

241
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,120
It just hurts.

242
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,920
And let me ask you something.

243
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,800
If your leaders know

244
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,400
a division chief like you hurt someone,

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,600
would you be punished or what?

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,040
Come in with me.

247
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,960
After you.

(Dadi Western-style Restaurant)

249
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
Here, Director Chen.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,840
Have some food, too.

251
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,120
Tell me. What do you want?

252
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,960
It's so great to be an official.

253
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,680
Quite putting on airs.

254
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,560
Destiny is quite unfair.

255
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
I was the victim.

256
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,560
And I lost my wife, too.

257
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,360
I'm both poor and pathetic.

258
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,320
But you, the abuser, got promoted,

259
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,680
became an official,

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
and now you live a rich life.

261
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,160
Heizi,

262
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,480
I returned you the favor a long time ago.

263
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
Director Chen,

264
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
how do you have the cheek to say so?

265
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,000
Was your hand crippled
or was your eye hurt?

266
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,560
And of course.

267
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,280
If you admit

268
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,560
you're still Xiao Chunsheng's dog,

269
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,280
I would have nothing to say.

270
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,200
After all, the dog owner paid his price.

271
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,760
Who would give a hard time to his dog?

272
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,560
Chen Hongjun,

273
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,880
unless you want me
to file a case at the police station

274
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
to hold you to account,

275
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,320
make you utterly discredited

276
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,560
and lose your job,

277
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,680
you'd better hear me out.

278
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What on earth do you want?

279
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,200
Something simple, Director Chen.

280
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,120
My goods are detained at the Customs.

281
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,640
I just want you

282
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,800
to get them back.

Yes.

Here's the thing.

We received a tip-off

340
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
that Guo Heizi bribed warehouse workers

341

of the Customs in your name

342
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,920
and had his detained goods
released without permission.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,080
Is that true?

344
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,640
He did visit me,

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
saying his goods
were detained by the Customs

346
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,280
and asked me to help him.

347
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
But after I knew it was smuggling,

348
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
I clearly turned him down.

349
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,200
But according to our investigation,

350
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
the Stock Out Receipts for his goods

351
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,240
has your seal on each piece.

352
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,520
What would you like to explain?

353
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,700
(Stock Out Receipt of the Customs
Seal of Xiao Chunsheng)

354
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Here.

355
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
You may have a look.

356
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
I keep a copy

357
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
of every receipt I approve.

358
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,520
(Stock Out Receipt of the Customs)

359
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,600
And it's numbered.

360
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,720
If you don't believe me,

361
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,240
confirm it with the Customs.

362
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,960
Not even a single one can be missing.

363
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
And why do your receipts

364
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
have my seal on them?

365
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm curious, too.

366
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,080
I hope you can check it out

367
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,840
and let me know.

368
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
OK.

369
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
We will check

370
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,040
all these receipts.

371
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,640
If a further investigation is required,

372
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
hope you'll cooperate.

373
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,920
Anytime.

374
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,840
OK.

375
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,200
Come in.

376
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,600
Why didn't you tell me you would come?

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm about

378
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,320
to visit you and say thank you someday.

379
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
For your supervision on our work.

380
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,080
Come on, Director Chen.

381
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,560
Don't say that.

382
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm a citizen of Beijing

383
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and it's my duty.

384
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,600
Take your seat.

385
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,280
Heizi will not

386
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
sell us out, will he?

387
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
What on earth do you want?

388
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,680
Something simple, Director Chen.

389
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,720
My goods are detained

390
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,560
at the Customs.

391
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,600
I just want you

392
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,320
to get them back.

393
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,400
Li Shangyou?

394
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,960
Tell me.

395
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
What do you want me to do?

396
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,080
Don't get me wrong.

397
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,640
I don't mean harm

398
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,200
and I'm trying to help you.

399
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm all ears.

400
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Your detained goods

401
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
can be returned.

402
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
Your smuggling business

403
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,200
won't be disturbed.

404
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,360
And,

405
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,480
you can still take your minions

406
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,480
to enjoy a rich life.

407
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,040
But from now on,

408
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,600
instead of saying
Director Chen is behind you,

409
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,080
you should say

410
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
Xiao Chunsheng.

411
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,920
You know him.

412
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,480
He's in many people's way

413
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
to wealth.

414
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,000
We want you

415
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,680
to move him out of his position.

416
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,400
You know.

417
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
I am

418
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,240
always reasonable.

419
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,040
I love to solve problems peacefully.

420
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,560
However,

421
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
some other people

422
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
love to play it the hard way.

423
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,480
To Xiao Chunsheng,

424
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,240
it may be dangerous.

425
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
When you help us,

426
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,840
you'll be helping him, too.

427
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
Right?

428
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,960
Don't worry.

429
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,680
If it goes smoothly,

430
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,360
no one will lose anything.

431
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,640
And after it's done,

432
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,320
I'll make you see the woman you want.

433
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,560
And of course,

434
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,360
if

435
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,160
you sell us out,

436
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,800
you can never see her again.

437
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,760
So, you really have Xiaohui?

438
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
Can a woman be that powerful?

439
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
A man always

440
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,680
wants a chance to make it up

441
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,960
for the woman he once hurt.

442
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,600
You're back?

443
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
Get ready for dinner.

444
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
What are you waiting for?

445
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
Come have dinner.

446
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,560
You'll wash the dishes.

447
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,120
The cook doesn't wash. That's the rule.

448
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,600
Xiaomei,

449
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,120
may I drink a little?

450
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,320
What's bothering you?

451
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
Heizi was caught yesterday.

452
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,600
For smuggling.

453
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,040
The other day, he came to me,

454
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,720
saying his goods were detained.

455
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,520
I didn't help him.

456
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
Looks like someone else did.

457
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,480
But he didn't confess

458
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
who gave him the receipts.

459
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,760
Our internal investigation
didn't get him out, either.

460
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,440
Very few people

461
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,040
have access to the seal

462
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,720
of clerks like us.

463
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,800
Whoever used it can be found out.

464
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,360
But that guy wasn't.

465
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,880
It means he must be someone

466
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,760
among our superiors.

467
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,960
What superior does Heizi know?

468
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,240
He...

469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
There must be more to this.

470
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,640
Chunsheng,

471
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,720
if you don't want this job,

472
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
just quit your job.

473
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,920
I'll feed you.

474
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,720
Then I'll be a toy boy, huh?

475
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm serious.

476
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,880
Didn't we talk about this?

477
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
The job in the Anti-smuggling Squad

478
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,040
was just temporary.

479
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,960
Maybe now,

480
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,080
it's time to have a new start.

481
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
I'll think about it.

482
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,560
Learn to be a good toy boy.

483
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
Have this chance to practice.

484
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,760
Which dish do you want first?

485
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
Let's eat.

486
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,820
(Discipline Inspection Committee)

487
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,480
Come in.

488
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,080
It must be something serious.

489
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
He was summoned.

490
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,960
Chief, Director Chen was summoned
by the Discipline Inspection Committee.

491
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,240
Fine, I see. Get back to your business.

492
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,200
OK.

493
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,400
(Division Director's Office)
(Xiao Chunsheng thought)

494
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
(Heizi's case was exposed.)

495
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,800
(But he felt it might be something else.)

496
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
I promoted Xiao Chunsheng

497
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
with a clear conscience.

498
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
I think the man who told on me

499
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,760
just fabricated rumors out of nothing.

500
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,240
He's completely slandering me.

501
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,480
Director Chen,

502
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,520
we'll have a further investigation.

503
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,400
Please cooperate at any time.

504
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,520
OK.

505
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,080
I will.

506
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,040
(The result was announced.)

507
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,240
(Chen Hongjun was criticized)

508
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,640
(for poor management.)

509
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
(But he didn't seem to care.)

510
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,120
(Because the man in his way for years)

511
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,280
(would finally be kicked out.)

512
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,200
I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Li.

513
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
You flatter me.

514
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,120
If there's anything I can do for you,

515
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,600
I'll be at your service.

516
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,440
Not for me, exactly.

517
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
For work.

518
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm all ears.

519
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
Write another tip-off letter.

520
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,480
To our Discipline Inspection Committee.

521
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,680
Who do you want me to tell on again?

522
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,600
Me.

523
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,360
Tell on me

524
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,880
for promoting Xiao Chunsheng
because he's my friend

525
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,840
and indulging him
with the smuggling case.

526
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,840
You're back.

527
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,320
Yes.

528
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,680
Oh, I'm going to another city
in a day or two.

529
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,080
Will you go with me?

530
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,320
What for?

531
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,440
To do some market research.

532
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,960
I've decided to do business.

533
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,440
But I can't just do it
without any preparation.

534
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,240
I plan to spend some time
on market research.

535
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,800
The test result of the orchestra
hasn't come out.

536
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
And I know nothing about business.

537
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,840
I'll wait for you at home.

538
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,600
OK.

539
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,600
As you wish.

540
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,190
Chunsheng,

541
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,880
in this case,

542
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,630
don't take it personally.

543
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,520
I promoted you

544
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,560
only because you were capable

545
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,840
and everyone witnessed that.

546
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,150
No one could complain.

547
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,920
And the promotion procedure

548
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,880
was reasonable and legal.

549
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm not afraid of the investigation.

550
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm serious.

551
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,120
And for Heizi's case...

552
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,230
We've been best buddies
for so many years.

553
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,320
And I know you.

554
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,120
You can't be involved.

555
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,960
Cheers.

556
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,160
Hongjun,

557
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,720
I won't call you Director Chen today.

558
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,160
I'll call you Hongjun.

559
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,560
Chunsheng,

560
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,160
what are you talking about?

561
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,520
No matter the circumstances,

562
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
in front of you,

563
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm always Hongjun.

564
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,520
Hongjun,

565
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,520
during my work,

566
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,280
I brought you a lot of trouble.

567
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,080
And you know I'm straightforward.

568
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
If I made you uncomfortable,

569
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,520
In my memory,

571
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,560
you're still the little boy

572
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,120
who always followed

573
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
Guohua and me.

574
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
But soon,

575
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,760
you're on your own.

576
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,120
Like I said,

577
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,480
you're always my big brother.

578
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,920
Hongjun,

579
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,880
we're adults.

580
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Theoretically,

581
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
I shouldn't nag.

582
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,920
But please understand

583
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,400
how much I care for my best buddy.

584
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,240
So, I'll say something more.

585
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,720
Hongjun,

586
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,280
a clever man may easily
get on the wrong path.

587
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,120
Take care of the Customs.

588
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,320
And I've decided

589
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,560
to quit my job.

590
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,240
Come on.

591
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,840
Cheers.

592
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Let's get hammered.

593
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,080
(When Chen Hongjun)

594
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,040
(finally expelled Xiao Chunsheng,)

595
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,680
(he didn't feel relaxed,)

596
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,080
(but disconsolate.)

597
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,800
(At last, he started
to bear many responsibilities alone,)

598
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,160
(good or bad.)

599
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,520
(He missed the old days.)

600
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,240
(But he knew)

601
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,720
(he had to get to a higher position.)

602
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,700
(Li Shangyou, General Manager)

603
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,640
Hello.

604
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,800
Is that Mr. Li?

605
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,760
Here's the thing.

606
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,480
My husband is Director Chen
of the Customs.

607
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,640
He can't find a notebook of work

608
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,400
and asked me to call you

609
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
and see if he left it there.

610
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,360
OK, thank you.

611
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,320
Hello.

612
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,560
No?

613
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,880
I'll try somewhere else, then.

614
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,720
Recently, Hongjun often

615
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800
went to your place.

616
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
So, I thought...

617
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,960
It's OK.

618
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,640
By the way, when was the last time

619
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,720
he went there?

620
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,840
I can't remember.

621
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,600
Yesterday?

622
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,840
Oh, yes.

623
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I remember it now.

624
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,400
OK. Thanks.

625
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,960
I should go.

626
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,560
- Farewell, Chief.
- Farewell, Chief.

627
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,240
Take care.

628
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,960
Chunsheng.

629
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,360
What made you lost in thought?

630
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,160
Nothing.

631
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,200
I've just been exhausted.

632
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,560
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

633
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
think carefully about it.

634
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
Will you really not tell me

635
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,840
what you're thinking?

636
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,680
Nothing, seriously.

637
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,720
I just sighed.

638
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,240
The world is getting better and better.

639
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,480
But why can we not live

640
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,520
as happily as before?

641
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,440
Even best buddies like us

642
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,880
are no longer as close as before.

643
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,600
Hongjun seems like a different person.

644
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,040
Guohua came back to Beijing,

645
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,240
but he didn't even tell me.

646
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,440
Go.

647
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,320
Oh, laundry time.
