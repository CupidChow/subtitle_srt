=Episode 4=

3
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,180
Let me fix it for you. Give me.

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,460
You seem to be dexterous.

5
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,820
I've been trained

6
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,140
to tear off the adhesive tape
and dress the wound.

7
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,420
Every girl in the military can do it.

8
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,460
Really?

9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,500
Try it on.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,220
Good. Very good.

11
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,660
Thanks, Ye Fang.

12
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,940
Why did you come to see me?

13
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,660
Why didn't you hang out with
Chunsheng and the others today?

14
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,140
I will. I'll go later.

15
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,060
To where?

16
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,220
Shichahai Ice Rink.

17
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,540
Xiaoliu came over early in the morning
to invite me.

18
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,740
He said...

19
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,780
You're unaware of that, right?

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,700
Unaware of what?

21
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,780
Your brother invited us to go skating.

22
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,100
He and...

23
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,780
Are you really unaware of it?

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,700
He Hongling?

25
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,540
Yeah.

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,420
It seems that

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,940
he has a chance with her this time.

28
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,740
So he invited us to go skating.

29
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
This is the first time.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,380
What do you mean?

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,580
Look,

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,420
He Hongling used to

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
hang out with Qi Tian.

34
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,660
I don't know what happened.

35
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,740
Your brother successfully asked her out.

36
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,540
We all thought that

37
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
she had fallen for Chunsheng

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,060
and your brother didn't have a chance.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,780
We never thought that

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,660
he could ask her out.

41
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,220
Impressive.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,500
Do you think
He Hongling likes my brother?

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,780
You should ask your brother.

44
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,540
You can tell if she really likes him.

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,220
Really?

46
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,540
Then can you tell

47
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
if someone likes you?

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,780
Sure.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,900
Really?

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,660
When will you go skating?

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,300
We agreed to meet at 3 p.m.

52
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,860
What about you?

53
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,220
I'll ask a friend to go with me.

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,420
OK. Let's go together, then.

55
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm a little tired.

56
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,780
You go on skating.

57
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,740
I'll buy you strings of candied haws.

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,020
Go ahead.

59
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm leaving, then.

60
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,100
What are you thinking about?

61
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,260
Nothing.

62
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,660
Impossible.

63
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
You know that, too?

64
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,780
Of course.

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,820
Fine.

66
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,700
Then tell me what I was thinking.

67
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,500
You're jealous, but you
act like nothing has happened.

68
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,140
Am I right?

69
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Well, why would I think about you?

70
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,220
Look,

71
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,140
Guohua is from a good family

72
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,820
and he is good to you. Isn't that good?

73
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm more than happy about it.

74
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,300
Why would I be jealous?

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,060
Maybe I want to provoke you.

76
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,260
Really?

77
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
Why do you want to provoke me?

78
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,780
Because you are a coward.

79
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,940
Don't you agree?

80
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,580
You dare not admit that you like a girl.

81
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,180
Instead, you pretend
to be a loyal friend.

82
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,980
You double-faced man.

83
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,740
I'll see when you stop denying it.

84
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,660
Comrade He Hongling, you misunderstood.

85
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,700
This world is not what you think it is.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,740
There's always someone
who doesn't like you.

87
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,180
OK.

88
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,540
I have to go.

89
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,620
Thanks.

90
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,780
Guohua.

91
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,260
Chunsheng, here you are.

92
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,980
- That's exactly what I want.
- Why did it take you so long?

93
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,420
The line was too long.

94
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,900
Try it.

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,940
This is definitely authentic.

96
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,220
It's cold.

97
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,180
Let's sit down and have some wonton.

98
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,940
- Xiaomei.
- OK.

99
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,500
Where is Hongjun?

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,540
- He had to go home.
- Sir.

101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,660
Wonton, please.

102
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,380
OK.

103
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,300
Guohua, give me a hand.

104
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,740
(Square Brick Factory;
State Run Snacks; Serve the People)

105
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,580
Guess who I just ran into?

106
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,740
Who?

107
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,580
Zhao Yan.

108
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,460
Which Zhao Yan?

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,540
The secretary of
the Communist Youth League branch

110
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,940
in our class during our third year
of junior high school.

111
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,300
A fair-skinned girl.

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,580
Didn't you like her?

113
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,620
Nonsense. Who told you that?

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,860
You told me yourself.
Don't you remember?

115
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,740
You told me while we were

116
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,540
learning to farm in Mentougou.

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,300
What did you say?

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,260
OK, stop.

119
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,380
Don't make up stories about me.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,380
I believe Xiao Chunsheng on this one.

121
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,780
Why do you believe him?

122
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,180
You didn't even know him then.

123
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,500
I don't have to.

124
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,740
I don't believe that
he would like anybody.

125
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,140
You don't know that.

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,740
He'll meet a girl eventually.

127
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,700
You know what,

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,020
I really met a girl.

129
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,380
The new trends of class struggle.

130
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,860
Why didn't you tell us?

131
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,940
Who is she?

132
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,300
You don't know her.

133
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,300
I don't know her?

134
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
If I don't know her,

135
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,260
where did you meet her?

136
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,980
Tell us.

137
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,660
At the Neighborhood Committee
of Dongcheng District.

138
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,580
The entrance of the Er'tiao Alley?

139
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,700
You know what,

140
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,300
there is a stack room

141
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,900
full of books confiscated

142
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,530
in the movements since the beginning
of the Cultural Revolution.

143
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,220
Innumerable banned books

144
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,500
we can't find normally.

145
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,010
Forget about the books.
Tell us about the girl.

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,010
Thanks, sir.

147
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,780
Where were we?

148
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,620
Six months ago,

149
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,140
I found a skylight in the room

150
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,060
that was easy to lever open.

151
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,100
Since then,

152
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,180
till a month ago,

153
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,140
I sneaked in there

154
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,020
to read books from time to time.

155
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,020
I had no sooner started to go there

156
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,460
than I noticed a girl

157
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,220
who got in occasionally

158
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,540
through the skylight too.

159
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,620
But I never met her.

160
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,260
Judging from the footprints

161
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,500
and the books she read,

162
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,380
I can tell

163
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,820
she must be a girl.

164
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,660
But I had never met her.

165
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,660
Then I got impatient.

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,380
I sneaked into the room and hid there
several days in a row.

167
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,140
Guess what?

168
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,740
What?

169
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,620
I finally saw her.

170
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,780
Is she pretty?

171
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,500
Sure.

172
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,620
And then?

173
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,860
Then, I dared not interrupt her.

174
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,020
I just sat there,

175
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,140
listening to her turning pages.

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,180
She chuckled or whimpered
once in a while.

177
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,460
You know what,

178
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,220
the girl is knowledgeable.

179
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
She probably comes from
an intellectual family.

180
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,700
She likes to read foreign literature

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,540
and medical books.

182
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,860
Most impressively,

183
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,540
she can read foreign books.

184
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,500
Tell me about it.

185
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,580
After she left,

186
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,140
I would check the books she was reading.

187
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,460
Sometimes she couldn't find a book
she wanted to read.

188
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,700
But I know where it was.

189
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,820
So I dug it out...

190
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,340
Eat.

191
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,740
And put it on the bookshelf
closest to her.

192
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,140
Just like that,

193
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
we spent some time together.

194
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,060
About a month ago,

195
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,060
on the day you met Hongling,

196
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,540
I made up my mind to say hello to her.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,940
And then?

198
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,060
Then?

199
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,980
Then I walked towards her

200
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,300
from where I was,

201
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,780
intentionally making some noise.

202
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,620
She was scared and tried to avoid me.

203
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,940
I was about to catch up with her,

204
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,100
not expecting that...

205
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,500
What?

206
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,460
The door suddenly opened.

207
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,860
It turned out that the guard always
heard noises in the room.

208
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,900
He thought it was haunted.

209
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,860
So he brought the security over,

210
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,620
stripped the seal, and went in to check.

211
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
They had no sooner got in

212
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,500
than they heard the girl's footsteps.

213
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,940
They ran directly towards her.

214
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,140
Whoops!

215
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,140
Then what?

216
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,380
I thought the girl was in trouble.

217
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,780
Fortunately, I had a flash of wit.

218
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,940
I pushed the bookshelf over.

219
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Bang,

220
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,220
they thought they ran
in the wrong direction.

221
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,540
So they turned around
and came after me.

222
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,580
They never thought that

223
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,420
there were two enemies reading
the poisonous books.

224
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,140
Make a feint to the east
but attack in the west.

225
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
You get it right.

226
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,620
Then what happened?

227
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,060
Did the girl escape?

228
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,740
Of course.

229
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,660
What about you?

230
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,820
I?

231
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,780
I was caught by them.

232
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,940
Then what happened to you?

233
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
How could

234
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,020
such a petty thing stump me?

235
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,740
Don't worry. I escaped unscathed.

236
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,820
Nothing happened.

237
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,980
But it's a shame that

238
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,780
I can't go there to read anymore.

239
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,060
Where was the girl?

240
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,940
She had long gone.

241
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,140
Have you never seen her again?

242
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,380
You've never talked to her,

243
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,660
but you take a fancy to her?

244
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,580
You know what,

245
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,820
I don't have to talk to her.

246
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,460
Seeing the books she read,

247
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,980
I know exactly what was on her mind.

248
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,420
So, find her.

249
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,420
How could I?

250
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,260
She must be looking for you, too.

251
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,700
She must know that you saved her.

252
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,900
Do you know what she looks like?

253
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,220
Of course.

254
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,620
A piece of cake.

255
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,460
Draw a picture.
Just like you drew the picture of me.

256
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,500
Right, Chunsheng.

257
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,620
Draw her portrait.

258
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,460
Yeah, draw her portrait.

259
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,740
Hang it over the rink.

260
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,060
Let everyone help you to look for her.

261
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,300
Maybe I know her.

262
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,020
If you can't draw her portrait,

263
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,500
there must be a problem.

264
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,500
What problem?

265
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,900
That means there wasn't such a girl.

266
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,500
He made up a story.

267
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,900
Sir, a portion of fried sausage.

268
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,060
Chunsheng,

269
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
was there really

270
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,380
such a girl?

271
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,940
Are you doubting me?

272
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,500
Have I ever lied to you?

273
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,700
Have some wonton.

274
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,020
Who wants chestnuts roasted with sugar?

275
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,900
Follow me.

276
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,700
Me.

277
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,900
Go.

278
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,020
Wait for me.

279
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,220
Xiaomei,

280
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,700
would you like fried sausage?

281
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,140
I'll get some for myself.

282
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
What's on your mind?

283
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,900
Fang,

284
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,820
what's wrong with you guys today?

285
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,300
Why are you so concerned about me?

286
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,700
I want to warn you.

287
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,260
OK.

288
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,540
Go ahead.

289
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,100
Don't do my brother harm.

290
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,900
What did I do?

291
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,860
You're going to
give up He Hongling to him.

292
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,980
How do you know?

293
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,580
Is it in the newspaper

294
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,940
or announced in the military?

295
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,460
Don't talk glibly to me.

296
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,500
I was there and I saw everything.

297
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,140
Everyone with discerning eyes can tell.

298
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,500
Do you think we can't tell?

299
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,660
Nobody is stupid
unless they pretend to be.

300
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,380
I don't know if others are stupid.

301
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,100
But you are too smart.

302
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,220
If it weren't for my brother,

303
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,500
I wouldn't spare time
to meddle in your affairs.

304
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,220
Fang, let me tell you.

305
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,740
He's also my buddy,

306
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,500
the one who's closer to me
than my own brother.

307
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,460
As far as I know,

308
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Guohua likes He Hongling

309
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,220
and she didn't turn him down.

310
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,740
I just think that

311
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,580
she's the kind of girl

312
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
who knows exactly what she wants.

313
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,180
She doesn't like my brother.

314
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,260
If you were together,

315
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,340
my brother would be sad
for a few days at most.

316
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,700
But what you've done

317
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,260
will only make everyone unhappy.

318
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,940
You think you are a loyal friend
and are sacrificing for a buddy.

319
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,420
You're childish.

320
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,820
At this rate,

321
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,420
my brother will hate you
sooner or later.

322
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,580
Think about it.

323
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,220
I...

324
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,060
He Hongling and he...

325
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,620
Don't mind their business.

326
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,060
By the way,

327
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,220
did anything happen to you today?

328
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,140
Let's eat.

329
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,660
Eat.

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,420
You scared me.

336
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,460
You should stay in your room.

337
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
Why are you here?

338
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,780
Wait for you.

339
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,700
Why?

340
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,940
Let's chat.

341
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,620
No. I'm sleepy.

342
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,380
OK. OK.

343
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,100
What are you doing?

How come the English tape I gave you

346
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,580
became pop songs?

347
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,540
Mind your own business.

348
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,300
Tell me.

349
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,380
In the afternoon,

350
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,260
what did you and Chunsheng talk about?

351
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,940
Proper business.

352
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
What business?

353
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,420
He Hongling.

354
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,420
Isn't that proper enough?

355
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,570
Why did you talk about her?

356
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,220
When I gave you this,

357
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,780
what did you say?

358
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,860
What did I say?

359
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,420
You said we should be
with those we were fond of.

360
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,660
I like He Hongling.

361
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,980
I really like her.

362
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,940
But she doesn't like you.

363
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,860
Just come to the point.

364
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,420
Do you want to say

365
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,700
you think that
He Hongling likes Xiao Chunsheng?

366
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,860
I'm not the only one who thinks that.

367
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,180
Everyone thinks that.

368
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,180
And Xiao Chunsheng
likes He Hongling, too.

369
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,260
You should be able to tell.

370
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Guohua, you know it perfectly well.

371
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,420
Why do you do this?

372
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,860
What do I know perfectly well?

373
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,580
You know Xiao Chunsheng
gives her up to you.

374
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,260
You know He Hongling
has an ulterior motive.

375
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,540
What motive does she have?

376
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,980
She is using you
to upset Xiao Chunsheng.

377
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Moreover, she thinks you can help her,

378
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
or our family can,

379
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
or both.

380
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,460
People are complicated,

381
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,980
just like you.

382
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,540
What did I do?

383
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,100
On the one hand, you think
you're better than Xiao Chunsheng.

384
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,140
On the other hand,

385
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,140
you think you're not as good as him
almost in every way.

386
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,220
Ye Fang,

387
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,060
you've gone too far.

388
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,940
Cut the crap.

389
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,780
I'm going to sleep.

390
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,260
Get out.

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,380
Ye Fang.

392
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,900
Does He Hongling think

393
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,260
I'm not as good as Xiao Chunsheng,

394
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,420
or do you think so?

395
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,780
Close my door.

396
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,940
Sit here looking up at the sky
on such a cold night.

397
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,220
No kidding.

398
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,420
Can't you sleep?

399
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,580
Speaking of that, I do feel a bit sleepy.

400
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,580
Let's go back to sleep.

401
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,220
Wait.

402
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,500
Tell me.

403
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,700
Do you also like He Hongling?

404
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,300
Chunsheng,

405
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
we grew up together.

406
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,900
You've been better than me.

407
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,380
But no matter what,

408
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,180
you always relinquish what I want to me.

409
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,420
I know clearly that

410
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,260
if it weren't for you,

411
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,020
the guys wouldn't

412
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,140
listen to me.

413
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,620
I also know

414
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,980
Qi Tian and the guys
don't think much of me.

415
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,540
Even my own sister

416
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,820
may look down upon me.

417
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
But I don't want you
to look down upon me.

418
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,340
More importantly,

419
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,060
I don't want to be someone

420
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,940
who looks down upon himself.

421
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,940
So,

422
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,620
Chunsheng, just for once,

423
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,780
don't give her up to me.

424
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,820
Let's have a fair competition,

425
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,740
OK?

426
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,260
OK.

427
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,260
Let's go back to sleep.

428
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,940
Go.

429
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,060
Guohua,

430
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,380
sit down and take a break.

431
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,180
It's OK. I'm not tired.

432
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,300
Mom.

433
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,940
Mom, I'm home.

434
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,700
Hongling, you're back.

435
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,420
Let me do it. Go home.

436
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,900
OK.

437
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Mrs. He, I'm leaving, then.

438
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,500
By the way, Hongling,

439
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,220
I have two movie tickets.

440
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,380
On Sunday night,

441
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,900
(Shengli Cinema)
The Flower Girl will be shown again.

442
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,340
Would you like to see it with me?

443
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,060
The Flower Girl?

444
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,100
I hear that the ticket
for the North Korean movie

445
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,700
is hard to get.

446
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,700
The movie makes everyone cry.

447
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,580
Hongling,

448
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,540
Guohua is really considerate.

449
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,900
Go with him.

450
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Let's talk outside.

451
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,100
OK.

452
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,900
Mrs. He, see you.

453
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,500
(Shengli Cinema)

454
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,340
Will you go?

455
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,220
You keep the tickets.

456
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,220
Thank you for

457
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,740
taking care of my mom these days.

458
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,100
Here you are.

459
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,420
What's this?

460
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,740
I reckon the stuff you've brought to us

461
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,580
these days

462
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,780
worth this much probably.

463
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,860
Keep it.

464
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,620
Keep it.

465
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,820
My dad taught me not to
take advantage of people

466
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,220
since I was a child.

467
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,820
Check it.

468
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,340
No need.

469
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,300
These days,

470
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
thank you.

471
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,580
Is it because...

472
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,100
No.

473
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,660
Don't think too much.

474
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
I have to go.

475
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,220
Hongling,

476
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Sunday night,

477
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,980
at the entrance of the cinema,

478
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,380
I'll wait for you till I see you.

479
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,700
Mom has barely

480
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,780
lived a comfortable life.

481
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,900
I have no cares even if I die.

482
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,340
I only worry about you.

483
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,220
You are bold and stubborn.

484
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,660
You're as reckless as your dad.

485
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,820
Your dad had already paid for it.

486
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,780
Moreover, you're a girl.

487
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,340
Mom, could you stop?

488
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,300
Do you know

489
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,700
why Mom has suffered from a hard lot?

490
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,100
Why?

491
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,660
Because I married the wrong man.

492
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,900
Mom, how can you say that?

493
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,460
Did Dad do anything wrong to you?

494
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,260
No, he didn't.

495
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,980
But you don't understand

496
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,940
marriage and life.

497
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,820
Mom was more ignorant than you
back then.

498
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,180
But Guohua is a nice young man

499
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,060
from a good family.

500
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,250
His father is a deputy army commander.

501
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,230
His mother works for the propaganda department.

502
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,740
I'm a useless person

503
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,820
in poor health.

504
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,580
I can't help you with anything.

505
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,980
Don't worry about me.

506
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,740
In the end, things will mend.

507
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,140
And I'm still young.

508
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,980
Not that young.

509
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,420
You need to seriously consider
your future.

510
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,380
I did it for your own good
when I stopped you

511
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,980
from seeing Qi Tian.

512
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,740
Now, look.

513
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,500
There are two young men
who are both good to you.

514
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,700
You should be careful

515
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,420
choosing between them.

516
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,180
Do you hear me?

517
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,980
By the way,

518
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,260
do you know The Flower Girl?

519
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,380
Yeah. It's very popular.

520
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,420
Have you seen it?

521
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,820
No. I've heard of it.

522
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,740
Why do you suddenly bring it up?

523
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,900
Nothing. I just blurted it out.

524
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,780
I hear that it will be shown
in Shengli Cinema.

525
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,420
Do you know that?

526
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,620
Well, do you want to see it?

527
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,660
Yes.

528
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,420
But the tickets are hard to get.

529
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,380
I hear that the tickets have been
distributed in the military compound.

530
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,660
Have you got any?

531
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,580
Who told you that?

532
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,740
I overheard them talking about it.

533
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,820
Shall we go and have a look?

534
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,180
(The Flower Girl)
No tickets left.

535
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,940
(Tickets)
Let's go. Go.

536
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,820
No tickets.

537
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,180
No tickets.

538
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,100
No tickets.

539
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,700
(The tickets for The Flower Girl
are sold out)

540
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
No tickets.

541
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,220
No tickets.

542
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,300
(Parking Lot)

543
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,380
You're back.

544
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Cabbage with sweet and sour sauce.

545
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,220
Yanqiu,

546
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,460
do we have tickets for

547
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,860
The Flower Girl?

548
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,460
No. Why?

549
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,300
Nothing.

550
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,380
I hear that

551
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,380
they may leave some for the compound.

552
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,220
So I asked you.

553
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,140
Though we are

554
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,420
living in the compound now,

555
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,820
nobody will think of us.

556
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,060
Do you want to

557
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,060
see the movie with He Hongling?

558
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,380
Who told you that?

559
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,060
Gossips indeed have wings.

560
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,740
Eat.

561
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,060
Do you think I don't know anything?

562
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,380
I already knew what happened

563
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,460
on the ice rink.

564
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,220
Why don't you ask Guohua
if he has any?

565
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,900
Chunsheng.

566
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,500
I know

567
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,220
you're sensible

568
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,500
and I don't have to worry about you.

569
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,820
But still,

570
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,820
I have to remind you.

571
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,100
We may have to take off

572
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,420
our military uniform any time

573
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,540
and can never put it back on.

574
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,700
If she likes you
because of your current status,

575
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,940
- I advise you...
- Yanqiu,

576
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,180
stop.

577
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
I understand.

578
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,140
Good.

579
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,420
Come on.

580
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,700
Eat.

581
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,780
Later on,

582
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,180
you take this to Dad.

583
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,980
The last time I saw him,

584
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,460
he was confused

585
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,260
most of the time.

586
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,060
Don't call him

587
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,340
when you see him.

588
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,460
It may be good for him

589
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
if he stays confused.

590
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,580
(Quotations from Chairman Mao
The people are the motive force of world history.)

591
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,340
Chunsheng.

592
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,180
Do you have time?

593
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,580
I want to take you to a place.

594
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,300
(May 7th Cadre School)

595
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,300
This is...

596
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,220
My dad lives here.

597
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,140
Your dad?

598
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:24,940
Let's go.

599
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,820
This way.

600
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,900
Dad.

601
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,980
I'm Chunsheng.

602
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,660
Officer!

603
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,380
Yes!

604
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
What's this place?

605
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,900
Sir, this is your bedroom.

606
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,860
Nonsense!

607
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,900
Why do I have such a nice bedroom?

608
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,220
How many times have I stressed

609
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,740
the unity between officers and men?

610
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,900
We are now in wartime.
Everything must be simplified.

611
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,180
You just don't listen to me.

612
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,340
Sorry, sir. I made a mistake.

613
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,620
This isn't your bedroom.

614
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,380
It's the Battle Command Room.

615
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,460
I put a bed here

616
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
so that you can take a rest
when you get tired.

617
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,540
Replace it with a marching bed.

618
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,340
Yes!

619
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,820
Report the position of the troops.

620
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,700
40 kilometers northeast of Jinzhou,

621
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,820
Majiapuzi.

622
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,100
You.

623
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,380
Who is this?

624
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm...

625
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,900
Sir, she is He Hongling,

626
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,580
the new telephone operator,

627
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,020
also responsible for decoding telegrams.

628
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,700
She looks smart.

629
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,340
Is she good at her work?

630
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Rest assured, sir.

631
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,340
He Hongling is a talented student
from the original

632
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,700
Communication Training Squad
of the 115th Division.

633
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,780
Great.

634
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,540
Officer, work with Comrade He.

635
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,780
You must complete

636
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
the communication tasks
accurately and quickly.

637
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,820
Are you clear?

638
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,820
Yes, sir.

639
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
He is...

640
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,380
My dad.

641
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,140
He...

642
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,580
He was injured on the battlefield.

643
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,780
As he gets old,
his old disease comes back.

644
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,860
Sometimes he's sober
and sometimes he's muddled.

645
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,220
I see.

646
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,180
Let's go inside.

647
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,300
Take cover!

648
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,460
- Dad.
- Take cover.

649
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,500
- Dad.
- Take cover.

650
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,620
It's OK, Dad.

651
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,820
Dad, it's OK.

652
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,420
Dad.

653
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,260
It's OK.

654
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,220
Chunsheng?

655
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,620
Dad, are you awake?

656
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,420
What happened to me?

657
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,420
Why can't I remember anything?

658
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,540
Who is this girl?

659
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,220
Dad, this is He Hongling,

660
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,020
a friend of mine.

661
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,660
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

662
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,140
Did I scare you?

663
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,900
No. No.

664
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,700
Chunsheng,

665
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,900
why didn't you tell me

666
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,220
you would bring a girl here?

667
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,060
This place is too messy.

668
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Don't worry, Dad. It's OK.

669
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,380
Come on.

670
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,650
Magnifier.

671
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,690
Has the time of
the general offensive been fixed?

672
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,610
It was fixed at the last meeting.

673
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,380
(December 20th, Saturday, 1975)
2 a.m. on the 24th.

674
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,690
Let's proofread the time.

675
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,690
- Come on.
- Yes.

676
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,540
Your watch.

677
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:42,140
(May 7th Cadre School)

678
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,500
That's the situation.

679
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,540
There are ups and downs.

680
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,900
When he's sober,
we need to accompany him.

681
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,060
When he's confused,
we need to watch him.

682
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,340
How long has he been like this?

683
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,460
Almost a year.

684
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,860
It isn't easy for you.

685
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,140
I'm used to it.

686
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,020
I bring you here today

687
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,820
because I don't want to
keep it from you.

688
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,180
I'll try to

689
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,700
get you the movie tickets,

690
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,460
but I can't promise you.

691
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,900
It's been years, after all.

692
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,820
My dad has lost most of his connections.

693
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,340
He can no longer take care of his family

694
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,700
as Mr. Ye does.

695
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
You told me that

696
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,180
I would soon realize my dream
of joining the army.

697
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,580
Guohua interrupted us.

698
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,620
I didn't finish speaking.

699
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,540
Although my sister and I
live in the compound,

700
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,020
we are in a similar situation with you.

701
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,060
I don't know

702
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,060
if I can still join the army,

703
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,660
or when I can. I'm waiting.

704
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,380
Do you understand?

705
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,260
Yes.

706
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,540
Let's go.

707
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,620
(Shengli Cinema)

708
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,820
(The Flower Girl)

709
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,340
Although my sister and I
live in the compound,

710
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,620
we are in a similar situation with you.

711
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,340
I don't know

712
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,340
if I can still join the army,

713
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,100
or when I can. I'm waiting.

714
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,220
His father is a deputy army commander.

715
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,560
His mother works for the propaganda department.

716
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,940
Though from such a good family,

717
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,100
he couldn't exert his advantages.

718
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,500
(There are four young people in Beijing)

719
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,140
(who couldn't sleep this night.)

720
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,860
(He Hongling never thought that)

721
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,500
(Xiao Chunsheng, who looked vibrant,)

722
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,620
(would face the same difficulties as she.)

723
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,620
(After pouring his whole story out
to He Hongling,)

724
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,340
(Xiao Chunsheng is
waiting for her verdict.)

725
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,660
(He Hongling didn't show up
in the cinema.)

726
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,620
(Ye Guohua knows that)

727
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,900
(he seems to have lost
in this competition)

728
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,620
(with Xiao Chunsheng.)

729
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,180
(Tong Xiaomei has been dithering over)

730
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,340
(whether to tell Xiao Chunsheng)

731
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,140
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)
(she was the girl in the stack room.)

732
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,700
(And her mother makes her
even more distracted by urging her.)

733
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,060
Xiaomei,

734
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,020
it's late. Stop reading.

735
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,740
Tomorrow,

736
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,180
Mr. Ye will visit us

737
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,340
with his family.

738
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,340
Go to sleep.

739
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,940
Yes, Mom.

740
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,780
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

741
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,540
Xiaohui,

742
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,900
how were you doing today?

743
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,300
I was doing OK. What do you think?

744
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,180
You did great.

745
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,980
Practice ten times later on.

746
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,820
- OK.
- Moreover,

747
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,100
when you get into the catch,

748
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,060
don't straighten your fingers.

749
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,940
Curl them a little.

750
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,060
Also,

751
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,540
you're really pretty.

752
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,660
I'm embarrassed, coach.

753
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,540
Don't worry.
I'll practice hard when I get back.

754
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,860
OK. I have to go.

755
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,660
I have to go, too.

756
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,380
Bye.

757
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,900
Bye.

758
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,620
Bye, coach.

759
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,300
Bye.

760
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,540
What do you think?

761
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,500
Think what?

762
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,900
What do you think of
my swimming strokes?

763
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,980
I know nothing about it.

764
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,940
Why don't you ask your coach?

765
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,220
Nasty.

766
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,380
Well,

767
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,060
why didn't Tian come?

768
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,460
Why do you ask?

769
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,380
I think he may have

770
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,500
some problems recently.

771
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,020
When he was here,

772
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,540
he kept swimming
as if he never felt tired.

773
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,940
I see.

774
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,860
Is it because of her?

775
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,940
Who?

776
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,500
Don't you know?

777
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,300
The two guys almost
chased after her to her house.

778
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,660
He Hongling is clearly
more interested in Xiao Chunsheng.

779
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,540
Who do they think they are?

780
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,620
They are nothing without their families.

781
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,540
So what?

782
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,940
Does Tian know it?

783
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,940
Of course.

784
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,660
What did he say?

785
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,780
He told us to mind

786
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,820
our own business.

787
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,220
So, it seems that

788
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,620
He Hongling does know
how to play tricks.

789
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,060
She's got a way with men.

790
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,620
Zhao Xiaohui,

791
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,980
how could you say such awful words?

792
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,340
Seriously?

793
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,700
What awful words did I say?

794
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,660
What did I say?

795
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,820
Are you interested
in that nasty woman, too?

796
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,940
Why are you so protective of her?

797
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,260
You're unreasonable.

798
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,900
I don't want to talk to you.

799
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm going to ask the coach
to instruct me in swimming.

800
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,620
Bye.

801
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,540
Guohua, I'm going back to the military.

802
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,140
Mom agreed with Mr. Tong
to visit them today.

803
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,140
Don't forget.

804
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,860
(Unit One)

805
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,660
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

806
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,980
You dared to leave your name
but dare not step out?

807
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,020
Heizi, Xiao Chunsheng is out.

808
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,940
He went out early in the morning.

809
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,180
Where did he go?

810
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,700
I heard that he was going to
see Liang Dong.

811
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,540
He did find a good place to go.

812
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,300
Heizi,

813
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,460
if you want to fix Xiao Chunsheng,

814
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,740
I have an idea.

815
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,740
Is your information solid?

816
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
Absolutely.

817
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,140
Every other week, Sunday.

818
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,100
Never missed once.

819
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,980
Yeah. Tian said that.

820
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,780
