=Episode 36=

3
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,800
Come on.

4
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,040
Guohua, this is my daughter Beibei.

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,480
Beibei, this is Mr. Guohua

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
who grew up with your father.

7
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Call him Godfather.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,080
Nice to meet you, Godfather.

9
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
Nice to meet you, Beibei.

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,520
Where's Hongling?

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,120
She's too busy

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,280
to come.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,560
Who told you so?

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Beibei, happy birthday.

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,920
Do you remember
what I told you last time?

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,400
Hello, Ms. Hongling.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,360
Good girl, Beibei.

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Guohua, let's go take a seat.

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,200
I hear that you can skate, right?

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,880
I have a birthday gift for you.

21
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
Open it.

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
Ice skates.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,400
Yes, ice skates.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,120
Do you like them?

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank Ms. Hongling.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
I know you love skating,

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,160
so I bought ice skates for you.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,880
When I was young,

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
I used to wear such skates.

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
I skated as well as you.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Yeah, Beibei.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
When we were young,

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
we all wore such skates.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
But, Mom,

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
the skates...

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
They are great,

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,480
right, Beibei?

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,000
Accept them first.

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,520
But we don't wear such skates anymore.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Beibei,

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,640
the skates are very good.

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,200
You should try them
before deciding to like them or not.

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,680
We all wore such skates

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
to go skating before.

45
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,480
They are convenient and durable.

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,640
Hongling, thank you

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,080
for bringing the gift over.

48
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Come on. Take a seat.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Let's have dinner.

50
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,880
Hongling.

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Sit here.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Come on.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Let's sit down.

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
You must be hungry.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
- Yanqiu.
- Long time no see.

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Serve the dishes, please.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,160
Sit.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Come on, Beibei.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,370
I'll sit next to you.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,820
(Happy birthday to Xiao Beibei)

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Who would wear those skates now?

62
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
Did you think you went back
to Shichahai 20 years ago?

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Can you stop talking?

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
I want a moment's peace.

65
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't want to quarrel with you.

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,920
You didn't see the look
in Xiao Beibei's eyes.

67
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
She must think you were sick.

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,480
You were insane.

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
I feel so humiliated.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you think I want to talk to you?

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
Do you think I want to be with you?

72
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,120
You misunderstood me.

73
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,080
You can leave.

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,840
Pull over.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Go.

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,480
He Hongling!

77
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
Did you go to see Xiao Chunsheng?

78
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,000
You're drunk.

79
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Stop.

80
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,480
He Hongling.

81
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm so disappointed.

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
We've been married for years.

83
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,240
Did I do anything wrong?

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,160
How come you still think of him?

85
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm your husband!

86
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Guohua,

87
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,880
let's get divorced.

88
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Xiao Chunsheng is the reason,

89
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,680
right?

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
It has nothing to do with him.

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
(Give the order to Li Shangyou.)

92
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,360
Chunsheng.

93
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
This one has already...

94
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,720
Tian, how is it going?

95
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,440
Is everything fixed?

96
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Everything is all set.

97
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,280
Now we are ready to welcome
Guohua and the foreign clients.

98
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,240
Guohua is really
cautious about the business.

99
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,880
After checking repeatedly,

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,000
he still has to bring
the foreigners over to check again.

101
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
I assume it'll be a while
before they arrive.

102
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,640
Tian, could you wait outside

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
to welcome them?

104
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,320
OK.

105
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,160
I'll recheck the production line.

106
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,480
We can't let anything go wrong today.

107
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
Rest assured.

108
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,940
(Welcome the visit and examination
of foreign guests)

109
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
All of our factory buildings

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,200
are newly built.

111
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,560
The equipment we're using

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,120
is imported.

113
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,720
I am satisfied with your factory

114
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
and production line.

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Then let's sign the contract.

116
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,440
Wow, of course.

117
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,920
Nice working with you.

118
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,320
Tian,

119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
I was looking for you.

120
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
Ask someone to inquire about
Li Shangyou's situation secretly.

121
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,880
I did.

122
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Ye Guohua picked up
the foreigners at the airport

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
and took them straight
to Li Shangyou's factory.

124
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,080
Don't worry.

125
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
We have Li Shangyou's number.

126
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
They'll get nowhere.

127
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,360
Li Shangyou doesn't have
the core technology,

128
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,120
unless...

129
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.

130
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,920
Tian,

131
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,520
you find out what happened.

132
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm going to the R&D Center.

133
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,040
Zheng.

134
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,680
Mr. Xiao,

135
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,640
why are you here?

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
I thought the foreign clients

137
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
would visit our factory today.

138
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
Could you

139
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,400
show me the latest

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
research data?

141
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,440
OK. Just a minute.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,000
Here you are.

143
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,280
This is our previous experimental data.

144
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,280
Mr. Xiao,

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
I have one more thing

147
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,960
to report to you.

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,680
There was a deviation in the data

149
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,400
of the high-frequency
oscillation ventilator (HFOV)

150
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
we obtained last time.

151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,760
My team worked overtime last night

152
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,560
to make corrections.

153
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Here is the final

154
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
corrected data.

155
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,840
OK.

156
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,040
By the way,

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
did anyone else come

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
to the R&D Center lately?

159
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,720
No.

160
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
We're the only staff here.

161
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,040
Others don't have permission.

162
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
OK. I see.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,720
What's wrong, Mr. Xiao?

164
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,200
What happened?

165
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,280
Nothing.

166
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,240
I'll let you get on.

167
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,040
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

168
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,520
Mr. Guo came a few days ago

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
to get you some data.

170
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Have you got it?

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,120
OK. I see.

172
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,200
I'll leave you to your work.

173
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,640
OK.

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,200
See you.

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,920
Guohua,

176
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,480
you don't seem to be in a good mood.

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,880
It's OK.

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,920
Did you have a fight with your wife?

179
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,040
Guohua, after so many years,

180
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
you are still devoted to her.

181
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Li, you don't understand.

182
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,040
To Guohua,

183
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,800
no water's wide enough
when he has crossed the sea.

184
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
I do understand.

185
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,040
Isn't that love?

186
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,200
Guohua is in grand and spectacular love.

187
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,200
It explains "love a beauty
more than power".

188
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,080
No hero chooses to be lonely.

189
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,680
Mr. Li, don't make fun of me.

190
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,080
How could I?

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm trying to look out for you.

192
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,640
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,840
Why do you have to clutch at one?

194
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,120
What do you think, dude?

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,000
Guohua just feels sorry

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,880
for Chunsheng.

197
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,200
It has just started.

198
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,920
Hongjun,

199
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
don't go too far.

200
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
We've been best buddies
for years, after all.

201
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,320
You don't need to go this far, do you?

202
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,400
Guohua,

203
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,720
we know you are kindhearted.

204
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,440
But it's to your disadvantage

205
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,400
to be kindhearted
and hesitant in action.

206
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
You know Xiao Chunsheng's

207
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
nasty temper

208
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,320
and ugly features.

209
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,320
How did Hongjun treat him?

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
Impeccably.

211
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,760
He did what was possible to help him.

212
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
But the rascal is arrogant.

213
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
I must warn you,

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,560
if you don't eradicate the evil,

215
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
you'll be consumed by it.

216
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
If you don't make him yield...

217
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,480
Mr. Li,

218
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,560
he won't yield.

219
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
Really?

220
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,000
Guohua,

221
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,800
I know what you're thinking.

222
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm not happy

223
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,640
about my current relationship

224
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
with Chunsheng, either.

225
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
Let's wait and see.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,400
Come on.

227
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,120
Cheers.

228
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,040
Hello.

229
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,080
Hello.

230
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,080
Mr. Li.

231
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
Are you still up?

232
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,080
Did I bother you?

233
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
What's on your mind?

234
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
Nothing.

235
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes, there is.

236
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,720
I can tell.

237
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,160
What happened exactly?

238
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,160
Business thing.

239
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
Guohua gave his order to Li Shangyou.

240
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,520
Li Shangyou?

241
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
How could he produce anything
without the technology?

242
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,920
I know Li Shangyou.

243
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,840
He wouldn't take the order

244
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
if he wasn't sure.

245
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,360
You suspect

246
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,480
that someone gave away

247
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,400
Chunxiao's core technology?

248
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm having Tian
investigate it privately.

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,680
We should get the results tomorrow.

250
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you suspect anyone?

251
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm not sure.

252
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,480
But I wish I was wrong.

253
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,960
No matter
who gave away our technology,

254
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,920
I'll hold them accountable.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,120
I just don't want

256
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,000
a brother who used to fight with me

257
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
to become my enemy.

258
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,880
Don't think too much.

259
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,720
Be patient.

260
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Let's wait and see.

261
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,350
Wait for Tian's investigation results

262
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
and see what he says.

263
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,590
OK.

264
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,400
Will do.

265
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,920
Mr. Qi.

266
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,960
Mr. Qi.

267
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,680
Mr. Qi.

268
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,440
Where is Mr. Guo?

269
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Mr. Guo hasn't come today.

270
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,120
No?

271
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,600
Chunsheng.

272
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,640
Chunsheng.

273
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
Heizi

274
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
has defected to Li Shangyou.

275
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,600
Tian, sit down.

276
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,800
I heard that

277
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,360
he suffered a huge loss
in an investment.

278
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,480
Why didn't he tell me?

279
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,680
How could he do this?

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,120
I dropped by
the R&D Center just now.

281
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,720
They told me

282
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,640
they hadn't applied for a patent
on the technology yet.

283
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,760
If he gave away the technology

284
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,800
to Li Shangyou,

285
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,160
our years of hard work will be in vain.

286
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,440
Chunsheng, did you hear me?

287
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Tian, look at this.

288
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,560
What is it?

289
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
The latest technology data I got

290
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,920
from Zheng of the R&D Center.

291
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,760
Tian,

292
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,400
we must continue
to surmount the technical difficulty.

293
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,000
Remember to keep it confidential.

294
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
I can only relax

295
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,200
when you are in charge.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
OK.

297
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
So Heizi...

298
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,720
Though he betrayed me,

299
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,720
if one day he repents his error,

300
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,080
I'll still regard him as a brother.

301
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,560
But he committed a crime this time.

302
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,040
Chunsheng,

303
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,200
you...

304
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,920
You don't have to mind me.

305
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:02,920
OK.

306
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,440
Tian, get back to work.

307
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm going to see Guohua later.

308
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,600
Does he have the guts to see you?

309
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,880
OK.

310
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm going to work.

311
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,200
Go ahead.

312
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,280
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

313
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,600
Chunsheng.

314
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Guohua, can you tell me

315
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,240
why you

316
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
gave the order to Li Shangyou?

317
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
This is our business secret.

318
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't need to explain to you.

319
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,840
But I want to know

320
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,160
in what capacity

321
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
you asked me the question.

322
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,320
Did you ask it as president
of Chunxiao Health Care

323
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
or as my former buddy?

324
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
If the former,

325
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,480
Mr. Xiao, we're only business partners.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,880
I don't care if it's you or Li Shangyou.

327
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Whoever has the better product

328
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
gets my order.

329
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,800
If the latter,

330
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,120
Chunsheng,

331
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,560
you shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

332
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,480
Mr. Ye,

333
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,400
business is business.

334
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm here

335
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
on behalf of Chunxiao Health Care

336
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,640
to ask for your feedback

337
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
on our cooperation.

338
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,080
OK, let me tell you.

339
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,680
Li Shangyou knows

340
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,320
where his position is.

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,720
He knows how far to go and when to stop.

342
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,400
He was appreciated by David.

343
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,640
Easy peasy.

344
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,040
How much do you know
about Li Shangyou's company?

345
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,800
He doesn't have

346
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,240
an independent R&D team.

347
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,880
Even his production line
has just been established.

348
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,160
The medical devices they produce
can't reach the standards.

349
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,040
How do you know that?

350
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,000
I went to examine
Li Shangyou's company.

351
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,480
They're absolutely capable
of producing qualified devices.

352
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
Are you sure?

353
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,080
Xiao Chunsheng,

354
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
why are you always opinionated?

355
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Do you think

356
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,520
your company is the best

357
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,160
and no one else can compete with you?

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I don't think

359
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,880
you came for the order today.

360
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,120
You're reluctant to admit defeat.

361
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,600
But I'm telling you,

362
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,640
you're defeated this time,

363
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,400
by the one you used to despise the most.

364
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,560
Guohua,

365
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm not here

366
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
to fight it out.

367
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,560
Health care isn't a simple business.

368
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,640
The product quality

369
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
will affect numerous lives.

370
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Don't give me the grandiose speech.

371
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,040
Just tell me,

372
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,760
why do you despise Li Shangyou?

373
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,160
On what base do you conclude
that their product quality

374
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
can't compare to yours?

375
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,320
Winning or losing
depends on the strength.

376
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,760
If my company is really worse than his,

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,360
I won't say anything.

378
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
Xiao Chunsheng,

379
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,640
do you think

380
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,000
you're always the best
and the most successful

381
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,120
and others are always inferior to you?

382
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,720
You're noble.

383
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
You didn't start the business
to make money.

384
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,000
You did it for your dreams
and the toiling masses.

385
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
Others only
concentrate on making profits

386
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
and they don't deserve
to talk about quality.

387
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm telling you, you're wrong!

388
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Li Shangyou

389
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
also has his core technical team.

390
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
His HFOV production line

391
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
has been recognized by David.

392
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,360
Guohua,

393
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm really looking out for you.

394
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
Anything wrong

395
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,280
with Li Shangyou's devices

396
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,520
will ruin your career.

397
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,200
Hold on.

398
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
Looking out for me?

399
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,400
I don't need you to do that.

400
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Do you remember

401
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
when we saw He Hongling

402
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
for the first time in Shichahai?

403
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,200
Heizi asked who was Ye Guohua.

404
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,800
You said it was you.

405
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,080
Are you Ye Guohua?

406
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,800
Who are you to make a decision for him?

407
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,560
And did you ask him

408
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,920
if he needed you to do that?

409
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
I've kept this to myself for years.

410
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
I must tell you today.

411
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't need you
to make any decisions for me.

412
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
The reason why you lost this time

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,080
is because you

414
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,360
are too arrogant and proud!

415
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
You deserve everything you get.

416
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I must tell you,

417
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,960
if you trust Li Shangyou so easily,

418
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
you'll ruin your company.

419
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,160
Tian.

420
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
In the past,

421
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,520
you said Ye Guohua
was Xiao Chunsheng's lackey.

422
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,400
Look at yourself now.

423
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,160
Look what you've become.

424
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,000
You've never thought much of me.

425
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,800
You go your way.

426
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll go mine.

427
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,040
You're heading for your doom!

428
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Li Shangyou

429
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,080
has Chen Hongjun as his backer.

430
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,840
Didn't I tell you that?

431
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
We couldn't compete with him.

432
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,240
Did you listen to me?

433
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,080
Then what happened?

434
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,080
Li Shangyou took the order, right?

435
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,200
I was right.

436
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,280
If you didn't help the tyrant to do evil,

437
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,200
could he take the order?

438
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,080
Remember,

439
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,720
from now on,

440
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,040
you're no longer my brother.

Clinical application.

447
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,440
And when newborns...

448
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,960
Our technology

449
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,000
is the most advanced in the world.

450
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,040
Yeah.

451
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,600
Look at this.

452
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,960
And the decompression technology...

453
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,840
Two types.

454
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,240
And look at this.

455
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,640
This data and that gradually...

456
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,400
Mr. Xiao, I have to go.

457
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,200
OK. Go ahead.

458
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll stay for a while.

459
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,080
Don't stay too late.

460
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,460
(Relevant Controls)

461
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,200
Chunsheng,

462
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
got it.

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,700
(Patent Certificate for Invention)

464
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,340
(Patent Certificate for Utility Model)

465
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,240
Mr. Ye,

466
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,840
the foreign client requests
to return our devices

467
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,800
on the ground of their failure
to meet the standards.

468
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,680
What?

469
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,840
This is the test report
they faxed to us.

470
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,360
(Test Report)
The report shows that Mr. Li's devices

471
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,680
only meet domestic standards,

472
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
not international standards.

473
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,920
So David requires a return

474
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,600
and compensation.

475
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,680
And also, they won't give

476
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,600
their future orders to our corporation.

477
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,500
(Test Report)

478
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
Guo Heizi, you jerk!

479
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,720
OK. OK.

480
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,200
Yes.

481
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
I see.

482
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
We'll solve it as soon as possible.

483
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,800
OK.

484
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,280
Thanks for your understanding.

485
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,480
- OK. Please don't worry.
- OK. Thank you.

486
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,160
Hold on.

487
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,920
Yes, it's us.

488
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,920
Thanks for your understanding.

489
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,280
Xiaohong, let me see this.

490
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,320
Can you check the date for me?

491
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,080
It's here.

492
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,120
Take a look.

493
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,680
Could you check the date

494
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,840
and the contract for me?

495
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,600
Hello.

496
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes.

497
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,320
We'll take care of it
as soon as possible.

498
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
But Mr. Ye communicated with you before.

499
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
We have to pay the balance later.

500
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,760
Could you extend
the deadline a few days?

501
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,240
No, I must receive the balance tomorrow,

502
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,400
or I'll see you in court.

503
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,920
Hello?

504
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,640
Hello?

505
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,320
Mr. Ye.

506
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,240
Calm down.

507
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,080
What's wrong?

508
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,800
Mr. Ye,

509
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,520
the Customs urged us again in the morning

510
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,840
to deal with the returned

511
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,920
exported goods quickly.

512
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,040
We've paid lots of

513
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,960
overdue fines.

514
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,360
And David's answer

515
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,480
is the same.

516
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,600
They won't accept unqualified goods.

517
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,520
I already knew that.

518
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,360
But, Mr. Ye...

519
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,600
What else?

520
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,520
Mr. Li...

521
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
What did Li Shangyou do again?

522
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,840
Their Finance Department
keeps pressing us to pay the balance.

523
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,440
They said if they didn't
receive it tomorrow,

524
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,680
they would see us in court.

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,960
In court?

526
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,720
He wants to see me in court?

527
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,480
Does he have the guts?

528
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,720
I'll see if he can win the lawsuit.

529
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,000
Guohua,

530
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,120
how did you make time

531
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
to visit me?

532
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
Come on. Sit down.

533
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,520
Don't play dumb with me.

534
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
Your devices are unqualified.

535
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,560
Haven't you got the news?

536
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,880
Unqualified? Impossible.

537
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,600
Li Shangyou,

538
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
our respective rights and obligations

539
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,320
are clearly written in the contract.

540
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,400
If there's any quality problem
with your devices,

541
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,920
you must take full responsibility.

542
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,960
And you must

543
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
pay all the compensation.

544
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Now David rejects the goods

545
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,560
and claims compensation.

546
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,560
I've already paid

547
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,400
the freight and demurrage to the port.

548
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,600
You must pay me back.

549
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Guohua, calm down.

550
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,760
And also,

551
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,600
you're held accountable
for the reputation damage

552
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,080
to our company.

553
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,600
The indemnity list
has been emailed to you.

554
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,640
Check it quickly.

555
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,160
Nevertheless,

556
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,560
I won't pay you a penny.

557
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,280
You won't pay, right?

558
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,800
It's OK.

559
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,800
You'll be

560
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,160
hearing from my attorney.

561
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,560
You can always go to jail, right?

562
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,880
Do we have to turn it nasty?

563
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,960
We can negotiate.

564
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,400
You said our products were unqualified.

565
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm telling you it's impossible.

566
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,480
Don't beat about the bush.

567
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
Cut to the chase.

568
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,800
Guohua,

569
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,840
you should read
the contract again carefully.

570
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,920
There's one term I remember clearly.

571
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
The revolving speed
of our core component

572
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,760
must meet the internationally accepted
CC standard.

573
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,120
The peak operating frequency
of our ventilator

574
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,800
should reach between 15 to 17 Hz.

575
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,400
We've met the requirements.

576
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,230
You examined

577
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,840
and picked up the goods yourself.

578
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,000
Am I right?

579
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
Li Shangyou, you bounder!

580
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,920
Did you juggle with words
in the contract?

581
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,280
The current international standard

582
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,190
is an average of 15 to 17 Hz.

583
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,080
But that's written in the contract.

584
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,080
They decline the goods

585
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,630
because EEC standards
are internationally applied

586
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,640
to invasive devices.

587
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,640
We've fulfilled
our contractual obligations.

588
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
We're bound by the contract, right?

589
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,120
You knew there was a problem
with your technology,

590
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,680
didn't you?

591
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
You set me up, didn't you?

592
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,640
How can you say that?

593
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,840
If you say so,

594
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
I must remind you, Mr. Ye,

595
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,760
I took you to the factory.

596
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,080
You examined the sample personally.

597
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
How could you come here

598
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,920
and give me problems now?

599
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
I was so blinded

600
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,440
that I believed you.

601
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,400
You have no conscience, and you don't
deserve to do health care business.

602
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,280
No, I don't.

603
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,920
But where did I get the technology?

604
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,720
You're well aware of it.

605
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,280
It couldn't just come to me

606
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
from Xiao Chunsheng

607
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
in the blink of an eye, right?

608
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,360
Mr. Ye,

609
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,760
you didn't go into it before.

610
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,640
I just don't understand.

611
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,360
You and Chen Hongjun wanted to
mess with Xiao Chunsheng.

612
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,960
Weren't you good brothers?

613
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,640
I kindly gave you a push.

614
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
How could you shamelessly

615
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,400
shift the blame to me now?

616
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,840
Mr. Ye,

617
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,080
you'd better calm down.

618
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,400
Cursing and fighting

619
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,840
won't solve the problem.

620
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,360
We live in a law-ruled society.

621
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,080
We should

622
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
know courtesy and the law.

623
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,760
I advise you

624
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,280
to go back and raise money,

625
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,320
otherwise...

626
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,260
(Incoming Call)

627
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,880
Is there any problem?

628
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Nothing. I'm tired.

629
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,640
We've been married for years.

630
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,440
I can tell if you have a problem.

631
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,880
What's wrong?

632
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Business thing?

633
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,960
Ye Guohua's goods

634
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,960
were rejected by the foreign company.

635
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,000
That's good.

636
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,800
The products purchased from Li Shangyou?

637
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,880
They deserve it.

638
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,720
It has nothing to do with us.

639
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,520
Why are you worried?

640
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,840
I'm not worried about them.

641
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
Do you know how did Li Shangyou

642
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,600
get Huasheng's order?

643
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,480
They bribed someone
to steal our technology.

644
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,400
The traitor is Heizi.

645
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,160
What are you going to do?

646
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,960
Chunsheng asked me to make the decision.

647
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
To be fair,

648
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,040
this isn't the first time
Heizi has got Chunsheng into trouble.

649
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,800
I shouldn't defend him.

650
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,320
But emotionally,

651
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,280
he's been my buddy for over 30 years.

652
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,760
When he came out of prison,

653
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,080
I begged Chunsheng.

654
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,840
I asked Chunsheng to give him the job.

655
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
But now he did this to Chunsheng.

656
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,400
There's no way out.

657
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,440
I should be blamed

658
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
for what he has done.

659
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,640
What does it have to do with you?

660
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,480
Don't take all the responsibilities.

661
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,800
I consulted with the attorney.

662
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,280
He'll be given

663
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,360
at least a five year sentence.

664
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,720
How did he go this far?

665
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,320
How many years do we have in a lifetime?

666
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,120
It's different now.

667
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
We've all changed.

668
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,560
You are no longer the big brother

669
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,480
who used to lead everyone

670
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,600
forward.

671
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,600
Heizi is no longer the younger brother
who knew nothing

672
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,640
but to follow your lead.

673
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,480
He has chosen his own path.

674
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,640
He should take responsibility
for what he did.

675
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,120
Hello.

676
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,120
I'm not going to the U.S.

677
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm going to Hong Kong, China.

678
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,040
Are you going to look for Xiaohui?

679
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,120
You're devoted.

680
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,160
Guo Heizi,

681
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
preliminary investigation shows

682
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,280
you are suspected of illegally obtaining

683
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,120
the business secrets
of Chunxiao Health Care,

684
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,120
causing significant economic losses
to the obligee.

685
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,160
Come with us.

686
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,920
Mr. Ye.

687
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,640
♪I planted a seed by the sea♪
