3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,880
Hongling,

4
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
it's late.

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,880
Why haven't you slept yet?

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Are you tired?

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
It's so late but you are still training.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm fine.

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,160
The qualification trials
are around the corner.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,720
I have applied for extra training
to our squad leader.

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
I heard

12
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,400
there is no five-kilometer yomp
in the trials.

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Guohua told you?

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
I don't need him to tell me.

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm experiencing life
in your recruit company now.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
I know everything about you guys.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,120
Hongling,

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,200
I must have the five-kilometer
yomp competition.

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Have you talked to Guohua about it?

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
Guohua doesn't understand
the stakes here.

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
I can't let others attack him with this.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,480
I think it's you who don't understand.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
Now everybody is happy,

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,080
why do you have to
make it hard for everyone?

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
We finally got here today.

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Now there's a shortcut to go,

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
why do you have to take that

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
longer road?

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,800
Why do you have to make it hard?

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,480
There is no shortcut in this world.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,800
There is a price to pay
for taking the shortcut.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,680
Chunsheng,

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
sometimes there's nothing wrong with

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
doing something against the rules.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
And everyone already agrees with

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
doing such a thing,

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
only you don't agree.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
People won't think you are a good person,

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
they only think you're stupid.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,520
Your old opinions

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
don't work anymore in this society.

42
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,960
I don't care about others,

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
but I, myself,

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,720
will only take the way I think is right.

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't want to have regrets.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,520
Stop!

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
Have you thought about me?

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Do you know that

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,560
someone told my superior

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,680
I was dating an ordinary soldier?

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
They speak with sarcasm everyday,

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
but I didn't care.

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
I work hard every day to improve.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
What am I doing this for?

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
I just want the both of us

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
to be promoted as soon as possible,

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,200
so we can be together without worries.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm working hard

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,920
for our future,

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,160
but what are you doing?

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,640
There is such a good opportunity

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,360
right in front of you,

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,280
why don't you just grab it?

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,680
Wait,

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,560
Hongling.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
You always only think about yourself.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,800
You never think about others!

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,200
Every day, you request

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,880
an extra yomp race.

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
You are training here

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
with a clear conscience,

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,840
but have you considered
what others would think of Guohua?

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
The contest content he announced

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,880
is opposed by his best friend.

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,480
You are ruining his prestige, you know?

76
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,780
(Elite Soldiers Selection Program)

77
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,780
(5 Five-kilometer yomp)

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,460
(5 Five-kilometer yomp)

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,360
Are you OK?

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm fine.

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm too tired to continue.

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,720
You go on, I'll take a break.

83
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
I don't want to hold you back.

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
You are a dragon
at the Shichahai Ice Rink.

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,600
Compared with you,

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm at most a worm.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,960
Let me tell you,

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,840
life is much more than Shichahai.

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,320
There is a wider world waiting for us.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
Maybe one day,

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
you will become the dragon.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
Let me ask you,

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,320
would you hate me for holding you back?

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
How is that possible?

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,880
Whenever you need me,

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
I'll help you without hesitation.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,840
That's what I'm talking about.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
So stop saying things like

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
you are holding me back.

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,520
OK.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
(This night)

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,960
(is completely different for the two of them.)

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
(In Xiao Chunsheng's view,)

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
(the relationship between the two
returned to the past,)

105
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,360
(and Ye Guohua was willing
to carry the load with him.)

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
(But in Ye Guohua's view,)

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,440
(their positions finally reversed.)

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
(He finally became)

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,760
(the person who can carry Xiao Chunsheng.)

110
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,380
Everyone!

111
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,260
At ease!

112
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,940
Attention!

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,140
Salute!

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,860
Down!

115
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,740
Comrades,

116
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,020
since your enlistment, today is the day

117
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,180
for you to face
strict examination for the first time.

118
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,660
You must

119
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,180
try your best

120
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,100
to become No.1 in every event!

121
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,580
You must be courageous

122
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,740
to challenge!

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,540
The elite soldier

124
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,660
qualification trials officially begin!

125
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,500
Good!

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,740
Grenade-throwing assessment!

127
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,220
For security considerations,

128
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
we use fake grenades.

129
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,980
Are you all ready?

130
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,140
Yes!

131
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,220
Let's start!

132
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,980
Ready!

133
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,580
Throw!

134
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,420
Xiao Chunsheng, step forward!

135
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,940
Yes, sir!

136
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,100
Ready!

137
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,100
Throw!

138
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:51,980
Throw!

139
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,140
You lost, Chunsheng.

140
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,860
Prone firing

141
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,660
with support,

142
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,540
nine rounds,

143
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
chest ring target!

144
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,140
Assessment begins!

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,620
Ready to shoot!

146
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,500
Start shooting!

147
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,900
No. 1, done!

148
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,580
No. 2, done!

149
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,940
No. 3, done!

150
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,820
No. 4, done!

151
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,500
Check your weapon!

152
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,780
Stand up!

153
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,580
No. 1, Duan Lei,

154
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,140
got 86 points with 9 shots.

155
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,780
No. 2, Xiao Chunsheng,

156
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,420
got 88 points with 9 shots.

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,300
- Bravo!
- Good job!

158
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,140
No. 3, Meng Jinzhu,

159
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,860
got 82 points with 9 shots.

160
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,660
No. 4, Qian Amao,

161
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,260
got 82 points with 9 shots.

162
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,860
Everyone! At ease!

163
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,340
Attention!

164
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,820
Comrades,

165
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,900
the results of this selection
of elite soldiers have come out.

166
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,180
Xiao Chunsheng and Duan Lei

167
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,580
tied for first place.

168
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,900
With the help of the platoon leader,

169
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,660
of course he would win the first place.

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,980
Qian Amao ranks second.

171
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,140
Meng Jinzhu ranks third.

172
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,020
Sir!

173
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
I once again solemnly request

174
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,180
an extra five-kilometer yomp race!

175
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:51,580
Grant it! Grant it!

176
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,460
Quiet!

177
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,100
This is the army,

178
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
not a place for you
to seek to prevail over others!

179
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,220
The superiors ordered us

180
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,780
to select elite soldiers.

181
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,940
They attach great importance
to the selection of this elite squad.

182
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,980
The elite squad has its own requirements.

183
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,140
I don't care

184
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,340
how you think of

185
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,740
or talk about me.

186
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,940
But remember,

187
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,500
soldiers must follow orders!

188
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,660
Will you also do this

189
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,340
on the battlefield?

190
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,380
Where I am is both the starting point

191
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,740
and the finishing point.

192
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,500
Are you sure you want
to compete like this?

193
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,100
Whatever he wants.

194
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,980
Yeah, we have to.

195
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,940
You also want to know the result.

196
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,980
You are trying really hard

197
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,660
to clear your friend's name.

198
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,340
The platoon leader was right.

199
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Soldiers must follow orders.

200
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,100
This elite soldier selection project

201
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
should go by rules, that's right.

202
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,500
But

203
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,380
a competition in private
is not a violation of discipline.

204
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,220
A victory should be undisputed.

205
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,580
That's right, it's late at night anyway,

206
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,940
whoever loses

207
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,260
will feel no shame.

208
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,620
Losing is not shameful,

209
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,460
but it's shameful to be afraid of losing.

210
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,060
I believe Meng Jinzhu

211
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,740
will record the time fairly.

212
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
No matter what the result is,

213
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,060
I will accept it.

214
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,780
Let's get started.

215
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,540
Let's go.

216
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,580
Ready!

217
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,020
Start!

218
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,340
Xiao Chunsheng.

219
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,340
I don't know how you did this.

220
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,460
But if the platoon leader trusted you

221
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,340
and didn't cancel the race,

222
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,460
he would win my respect for sure.

223
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,420
You improved so much

224
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,420
in such a short time.

225
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,780
My hard practice paid off.

226
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,900
The crescent moon has become a full moon.

227
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,780
Actually, I know

228
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
it wasn't you who asked the platoon leader

229
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,980
to cancel the five-kilometer yomp race.

230
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,740
How do you know that?

231
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,980
Although I don't know enough
about the platoon leader,

232
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,980
but I know

233
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,900
you wouldn't do that.

234
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,380
You are always

235
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,620
honest.

236
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,740
I appreciate that.

237
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,860
And don't forget,

238
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,420
we are

239
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,380
brothers.

240
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,980
Come on.

241
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,420
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

242
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,820
OK.

243
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,940
Xiao Yanqiu,

244
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,900
there's a letter from your brother.

245
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,620
Coming, Mr. Niu!

246
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,380
Mr. Niu.

247
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,660
Xiaomei.

248
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,860
A letter from Chunsheng.

249
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,340
Thanks.

250
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,660
Is it another letter

251
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,460
from that young soldier in Yunnan?

252
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,820
What does it say?

253
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
Dad, Yanqiu,

254
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,420
I'll tell you some good news.

255
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,660
My recruit company training is over.

256
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,820
I have been assigned to the field forces.

257
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,180
And I even entered the elite squad.

258
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,940
Mr. Xiao, Chunsheng
has entered the elite squad.

259
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,540
Who is Chunsheng?

260
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,100
It's your son.

261
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,660
I'm glad that

262
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,300
I left the military compound

263
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,780
and left Beijing.

264
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,740
I saw the wider world

265
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,980
and encountered stronger opponents,

266
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,460
which helped me inspire a better self.

267
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,820
Although there was frustration
of being defeated for the first time,

268
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,100
and loneliness of not being understood,

269
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,140
but I'm firmly walking

270
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,900
on the road I chose.

271
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,220
Like how you taught me,

272
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,620
I thank them for making me better.

273
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,580
(Tong Xiaomei's restless heart)

274
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,740
(was again instigated by Xiao Chunsheng.)

275
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,980
(She is also eager to leave
the compound and Beijing)

276
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,180
(for the wide world,)

277
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,980
(where she can realize her ideal.)

278
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,540
The next speechmaker

279
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,900
is Chen Hongjun
from the Chinese Language Department.

280
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,260
(Campaign Speeches for
Chairman of the Students' Union)

281
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,140
Teachers, fellow students,

282
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,980
hello, everyone.

283
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,380
The topic of my speech today is

284
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
The Historical Responsibilities
of Contemporary Youth and My Wishes.

285
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Youth is a new force to promote

286
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,340
social progress and
the development of the times,

287
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,260
representing the spiritual state
of the times

288
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,580
and the overall image of the nation.

289
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,420
As a young man,

290
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,460
we must...

291
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,060
I...

292
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,500
We must firmly...

293
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,260
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm a little excited

295
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,060
because

296
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
a very important person to me

297
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,620
is here today.

298
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,540
That is my fiancée.

299
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,820
He's got a fiancée already!

300
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,340
Who is it?

301
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,500
It's she who

302
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,660
stopped me from doing wrong things like

303
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,140
fighting and messing around,

304
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,180
and put me back onto the right path

305
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,100
of studying knowledge.

306
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,860
Of course,

307
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,860
she did something more important.

308
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,500
She was the one who guided me

309
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,740
to see the world

310
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,540
and the times we belong to.

311
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,620
She was also the one who taught me to

312
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,260
experience, feel,

313
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,340
and always firmly aim at the distance.

314
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,060
We are in an unprecedented era.

315
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
For our country that needs development,

316
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,180
progress

317
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,860
and change,

318
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,260
this is tantamount to a thunderbolt.

319
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,420
For us young people,

320
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,820
we should be ready for everything!

321
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,340
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

322
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,060
(The speech was a big success,)

323
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,900
(Chen Hongjun was successfully elected
as the chairman of the Students' Union.)

324
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,820
(Quiet)

325
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,620
Xiaomei, Director wants to see you.

326
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,780
Thanks.

327
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,580
You are welcome.

328
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,380
Come in.

329
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,780
Director, you wanted to see me?

330
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,380
Sit down.

331
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,900
Xiaomei, take a look at this.

332
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,420
This is a document
sent by the Health Bureau.

333
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,060
You are from a military family,

334
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,860
so you should know
the situation over there better than me.

335
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,100
The conditions are poor there

336
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,420
with a shortage of medical personnel.

337
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,700
So the military region organized
this special recruitment

338
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,140
to absorb medical talents.

339
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,260
You can read the last page first.

340
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,260
There is a specific training plan.

341
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,460
See if you are interested.

342
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
Xiaomei, you are 21 this year, right?

343
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,140
Yes, Director.

344
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,700
If you enter college this year
and study for five years,

345
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,260
you'll be 26 when you graduate.

346
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
For a surgeon, it's a relatively

347
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,260
late start.

348
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,180
I think

349
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,100
this is a great opportunity.

350
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,340
It's just that

351
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,020
you need to consider it carefully.

352
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,940
After all, there are risks and dangers.

353
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,220
I don't worry about that.

354
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,740
I am still young.

355
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,980
I just want to improve

356
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,180
my own medical skills

357
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,580
to save more people.

358
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,340
Then you should prepare for it

359
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,340
and grab this opportunity.

360
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,340
Thank you, Director.

361
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,060
Xiaomei.

362
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,620
(Beijing Chunhui Textile Factory)

363
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,460
What's the matter, Yanqiu?

364
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,380
I just want to ask for our group

365
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
when our last month's salary
will be settled.

366
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,100
Yanqiu.

367
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,580
If we had money,

368
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,540
of course we would settle it.

369
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,100
The factory met some difficulties.

370
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,220
Could you please make an exception

371
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,540
and settle mine first?

372
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,420
Yanqiu, how can you make such a request?

373
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
That is unreasonable.

374
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,140
So many veteran workers
didn't get their salary yet,

375
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,620
how can you ask me to settle your salary

376
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
first?

377
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,820
If my family hadn't had difficulty,

378
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,620
I wouldn't have made such a request.

379
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,460
Everybody has difficulties now.

380
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,940
You are not an exception.

381
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,860
It's not like you don't know
how difficult it is for the management.

382
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,580
We have to find a way
to overcome it, right?

383
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,260
Yanqiu, you asked for leave
too often recently.

384
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,020
I didn't want to bring it up,

385
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
but you have to be aware of that.

386
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,300
Before...

387
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,580
Yanqiu!

388
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,100
You still think of yourself
as the daughter of a cadre?

389
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,420
Yanqiu,

390
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,820
how did it go?

391
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,780
What did Director Liu say?

392
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,300
What could he say?

393
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,140
Nothing new.

394
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,340
He wants us to understand
the difficulties of the management.

395
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,340
Easy for him to say.

396
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,980
Why don't they

397
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,220
show consideration to the workers?

398
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,780
We all have families to support.

399
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,580
He's leaving.

400
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,700
Alright. Alright.

401
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,540
Excuse me. I saw a friend.

402
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,140
OK.

403
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,060
Director Liu is snobbish.

404
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
He dares not mess with

405
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,500
those vixenish workers.

406
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:52,860
That's right.

407
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,620
He would give them some money at least.

408
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,380
Yanqiu.

409
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,900
We are being too easy-going.

410
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,900
Qi Tian?

411
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Why are you here?

412
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,260
An old acquaintance
introduced me to a new job.

413
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,300
Today, I delivered

414
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,660
some goods to your factory.

415
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,500
I was wondering if I could meet you.

416
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,460
Have you eaten yet?

417
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,380
Nope.

418
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
I will eat with my coworkers

419
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,460
after we finish working.

420
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,660
I brought a lot. Let's eat together.

421
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,060
Enough. Enough for me.

422
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,340
You gave me too much. You should...

423
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,500
- I can't eat so much.
- Save some for yourself.

424
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,300
- Enough.
- Your job is tiring.

425
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,620
You should eat a lot,

426
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,780
otherwise,
you won't have enough strength.

427
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,980
Take this.

428
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,060
What are you doing?

429
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,260
I heard what you said.

430
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
Just take it.

431
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,780
I know you don't want Chunsheng

432
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
to worry about you.

433
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,860
Tell me if you have
any difficulties in the future.

434
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,580
I can't take it.

435
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,460
You earned it through hard work.

436
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,020
You should save it up.

437
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,660
I don't have a family to support.

438
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,660
Take it.

439
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,980
Just in case.

440
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
If you don't need it,

441
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,220
just save it up for me.

442
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,340
Hongling, look who's here.

443
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,420
Hongling.

444
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,380
Chunsheng?

445
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,700
Look what I brought you.

446
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,220
It's dried sweet potatoes from home.

447
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,020
I know you like it,
so I brought you some.

448
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,780
Come, share it with everyone.

449
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,540
You'll all get some.

450
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,380
Really?

451
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,300
Of course.

452
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,140
Hongling,

453
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,140
this is...

454
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,180
He is...

455
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,700
Ma'am,

456
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,180
I am Xiao Chunsheng,
a soldier of the elite squad

457
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,540
who is about to be
assigned to the 11th Army.

458
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,860
After the recruit company is disbanded,

459
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,740
our elite squad

460
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,940
will go to the military region
for final combat training.

461
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,820
So I'm taking this chance
to visit Hongling.

462
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,580
Hongling and I

463
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,940
grew up together.

464
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,420
You grew up together?

465
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,020
Yes.

466
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,740
Here, ma'am.

467
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,580
Try this.

468
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,900
I'm good. Thank you.

469
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,460
Ma'am, I have to ask you

470
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,940
to take care of Hongling,

471
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,780
otherwise, I wouldn't know

472
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,300
how to face her mother.

473
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,860
Come on, Hongling,
share it with everyone.

474
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,620
Ladies, thank you

475
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,060
for taking care of Hongling for me.

476
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,900
You take your time.

477
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,620
OK.

478
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,140
Chen Can, come with me.

479
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,700
You are really not Hongling's boyfriend?

480
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,940
Boyfriend?

481
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,340
Who spread that rumor?

482
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,060
There is only revolutionary friendship
between Hongling and me.

483
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,980
Revolutionary friendship?

484
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,620
Comrade Xiao, you came at the right time.

485
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,340
You don't know,

486
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,460
that girl just now

487
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,820
spread rumors everywhere
that Hongling is dating you.

488
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,820
I knew she was lying.

489
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,580
See? I am right.

490
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,660
You are so right!

491
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,140
Those chasing Hongling are lining up.

492
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,940
Even Secretary Li

493
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,780
took Hongling to take pictures

494
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
and said to put her on
Military Region Newspaper.

495
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,780
He did a lot of things like that,

496
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,860
but Hongling didn't even
give him a chance.

497
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,740
How could she be easily dating someone?

498
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,580
Am I right?

499
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,620
Yes!

500
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,580
Chunsheng, didn't you say
you would invite me to dinner?

501
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,140
Let's go.

502
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,980
Chunsheng,

503
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,780
the thing about Secretary Li
that girl mentioned...

504
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,380
What?

505
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,180
Are you afraid that
I'm gonna think too much?

506
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,980
How is that possible?

507
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,060
I, Xiao Chunsheng,
believe in my own charm.

508
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,980
Cut it out.

509
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,180
By the way,
when will you return to the army?

510
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,260
Tomorrow.

511
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,060
The field army
is not like the recruit company.

512
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,340
You have to develop a good relationship

513
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,700
with your comrades-in-arms
and your superiors.

514
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,180
Don't worry. I got it.

515
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,460
You came especially today
to refute the rumors for me?

516
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,780
You said someone told your superior
that you were dating someone.

517
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,060
Of course I'd come to help you.

518
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,220
You are really good at making up stories.

519
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,020
We grew up together?

520
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,260
Are you serious??

521
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,700
You grew up together with Ye Fang,
Xiaomei and the others.

522
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,700
I just made that up.

523
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,060
Chunsheng,

524
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,020
sooner or later,

525
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
I'll tell everyone

526
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,820
you are my boyfriend.

527
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,020
Let's go.

528
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,900
Shoot.

529
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,060
Director Liu, we are waiting for you.

530
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,220
What's taking you so long?

531
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,260
Listen,

532
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,500
I was being too merciful last time

533
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,380
by not winning all your money.

534
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,620
Today, I will win all your money over.

535
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,580
All right, my money is waiting for you.

536
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,660
Just hurry up.

537
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,020
We are all waiting for you.

538
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,100
Coming.

(Beijing Chunhui Textile Factory)

540
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,300
I can't believe you guys.

541
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
You couldn't wait to win my money, huh?

542
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,620
You called me again and again.

543
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,460
What's the hurry?

544
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
What took you so long?

545
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,420
We have waited for you for so long.

546
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,700
I came right after

547
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,980
I took your call.

548
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,380
Come on!

549
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,180
I will win today.

550
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,340
Last time, you owed me...

551
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,820
You got in the wrong door?

552
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,220
Why are you here?

553
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,580
The factory isn't profitable

554
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
and can't pay the workers,

555
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,380
but you do have a lot of

556
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,020
gamble fund, huh?

557
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,620
This is public money, right?

558
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,420
Wait, why are you...

559
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,900
What does it have to do with you?

560
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,820
I paid you already.

561
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,180
Dude,

562
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,420
please solve your grudges in private.

563
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,740
Don't disturb our game.

564
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,300
I have no grudges against him. Really!

565
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,460
I have...

566
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,780
Wait.

Director Liu,

568
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,260
who is he?

569
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,260
He is the one
who delivered goods to our factory.

570
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,820
What's wrong with you?

571
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,580
Why are you making trouble here?

572
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,580
Do not move.

573
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,820
Bro.

574
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,260
Calm down. Calm down.

575
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,100
- Sir!
- Calm down.

576
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,780
What's wrong?

577
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,060
He's attacking us!

578
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,700
Tian?

579
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,220
What are you doing here today?

580
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,060
Tian?

581
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,140
You... You are Qi Tian
who is famous in the whole city?

582
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,980
Let go, please. It's a misunderstanding.

583
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,940
It's a misunderstanding.

584
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,260
Didn't you say he was a deliverer?

585
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,940
He is...

586
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,540
He delivered goods to our factory.

587
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,540
But I didn't know you, sir.

588
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,820
Tomorrow,

589
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,220
pay the workers.

590
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
And tell your manager

591
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,140
that I quit your work.

592
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,260
No problem.

593
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,940
He owes you money, right?

594
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,220
I'll slap him for you.

595
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,020
See you around, bro.

596
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,700
Alright.

597
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,980
Goodbye, sir.

598
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,820
How could you offend him?

599
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,420
I didn't... I didn't offend him!

Come here.

You wanted to see me?

This is your salary.

It's all here. Count it.

606
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,380
I told you, Yanqiu,

607

that the factory is your home.

608

We are family.

609
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,020
So of course,

610
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,100
when you have trouble,

611
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,780
just tell the organization,

612
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,180
and the management,

613
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,860

Of course. He's a friend.

have any requests in the future.

- Unbelievable.

Isn't Qi Tian here?

He said that he wouldn't come today.

By the way,

No way.

646
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,780
How can he compare with you?

649
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,140
Tian was doing odd jobs.

650

Tell him next time you see him that

651

there will definitely be
new developments and chances

00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,180
It's me, Mr. Xiao.

Oh, it's you, Qi Tian.

657
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,820
Dad, you are treating Xiaomei
as your own daughter now.

658
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,100
She called to say

659
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,380
she was not coming today.

660
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,820
She is preparing for her exams.

Tian,

662
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,820
Chunsheng mentioned you in the letter.

663
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,660
Really? He mentioned me?

664
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,420
He also worries about you in the army.

665
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,700
He really worries too much.

666
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,140
Read it yourself.

667
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,220
Alright. OK.

668
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,020
Qi Tian.

669
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,180
Thank you.

670
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,340
What for?

671
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,420
Director Liu's matter.

672
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,260
I didn't expect him to tell you.

673
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,580
He's really scared by you.

674
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,980
He didn't say much,

675
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,220
but from the beginning to the end,

676
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,860
he dared not say your full name.

677
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,260
He kept calling you
Tian who is famous all over the city.

678
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,340
That's ridiculous.

679
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,100
That's all in the past now.

680
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,740
Sorry

681
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,980
for costing you another job.

682
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,140
That's not a job.

683
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,100
Not a good one at least.

684
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,220
I can work anywhere.

685
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,580
I went to the brick factory
to move bricks today.

686
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,420
I make more money there
than in the textile factory.

687
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,620
Qi Tian, I think these jobs
are unworthy of your talents.

688
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,340
I mean it.

689
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,300
I think my brother is right.

690
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,260
Times are different now,

691
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,700
you should look around

692
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,820
for more opportunities,

693
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,620
and a job right for you.

694
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,940
What did I say?

695
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,340
He is really worrying too much.

696
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,860
He always keeps nagging.

697
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,900
I can't believe him.

698
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,980
I'm serious.

699
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,580
I think

700
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,740
you should not be bound by the past.

701
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,540
Try to find more opportunities.

702
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,180
Do not give up.

703
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,420
OK.

704
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:05,140
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

705
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,460
(Be trained to be the best soldiers)

706
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,260
(After the Elite Squad was included
in the sequence of combat troops,)

707
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,660
(under Ye Guohua's rigorous training,)

708
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,540
(they soon mastered special combat skills.)

709
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,740
(Through the training,)

710
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,460
(they received both physical)

711
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,300
(and psychological tests,)

712
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,220
(and were forged into sharp blades
to defend the Republic.)

713
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,060
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

714
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,460
It's such an important thing,

715
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,180
but you didn't discuss it with us at all.

716
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,980
Luckily those in charge of
political appraisal called your dad.

717
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,420
Were you planning to tell us

718
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,940
right before the train leaves?

719
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,300
I just did that to avoid suspicion.

720
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,620
I should rely on myself

721
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,580
and not mention Director Qi

722
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,860
and Commander Tong too much.

723
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,740
Isn't this what you taught me
since childhood?

724
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,980
Moreover,

725
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,100
didn't you always want me
to be in the military too?

726
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,060
Now,

727
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,100
such a good chance
appeared right in front of me.

728
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,140
What is there to discuss about?

729
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,220
You are always right.

730
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,220
Mom, step aside.

731
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,700
Mrs. Tong.

732
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,380
Ye Fang.

733
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,860
I heard that Xiaomei is going to
participate in the special recruitment.

734
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,500
Yes.

735
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,220
She made the decision for herself.

736
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,020
What a bold girl.

737
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,860
She never

738
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,220
discusses anything with us.

739
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,500
Fang, persuade her for me.

740
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,500
(Medical Nursing)

741
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,780
(Physiatry)

742
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,300
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

743
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,780
I'll talk to her.

744
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,460
OK.

745
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,100
Xiaomei,

746
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,660
Ye Fang is here.

747
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,620
Xiaomei.

748
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,020
Mom,

749
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,420
the notice will arrive in a few days.

750
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,860
Please stop meddling in it.

751
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,340
Tong! Tong!

752
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,780
Did you hear what your daughter said?

753
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,140
As a friend,

754
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,820
I support you

755
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,860
no matter what choice you make.

756
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,100
But I also need to remind you

757
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,900
don't get carried away by love.

758
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,500
Xiao Chunsheng is with He Hongling now.

759
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,980
I am serious.

760
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,180
You have to be responsible for your

761
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,460
ideals, career, and life.

762
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,140
You shouldn't give up the college

763
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,860
and participate
in the special recruitment

764
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,940
just for a man.

765
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,300
You are risking your future by doing that.

766
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,580
Do you think it's worth it?

767
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,780
Fang,

768
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,060
thank you

769
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,180
for your support and your concern.

770
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,500
I admit that

771
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,460
Xiao Chunsheng is part of the reason
why I made this choice,

772
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,100
but it's not like what you think.

773
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,100
We've made it clear before he left

774
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,580
that we are just friends

775
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,060
who encourage each other

776
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,540
on the way to realizing our dreams.

777
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,660
Maybe it's not as simple as I said.

778
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,500
I don't know how to put it.

779
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,420
Sometimes, when I see him,

780
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,140
it's like seeing another self.

781
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,340
His free spirit,

782
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,780
frankness, kindness,

783
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,620
and persistence in realizing his dreams

784
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,620
remind me of that person I want to be.

785
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,860
He is not that good.

786
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,740
You can't fool me.

787
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,300
I know that

788
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
among our friends,

789
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,860
you value him the most.

790
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,260
That's because the others are worse.

791
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,980
Recently,

792
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,020
I've been reading letters for Mr. Xiao

793
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,540
and taking classes at college.

794
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,620
These things allowed me
to see a wilder world,

795
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,620
a world outside Beijing.

796
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,660
So when I heard about
this special recruitment,

797
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,620
I made the decision in my heart.

798
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,700
I have also considered
those practical issues,

799
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,620
but I can't resist my own heart.

800
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,940
She no longer wants to be an onlooker.

801
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,420
She wants to start a fiery-colored life.

802
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,980
She wants her youth

803
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,460
to be sparkling,

804
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,940
even if it can't be remarkable.
