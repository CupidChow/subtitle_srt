=Episode 20=

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,680
Throughout my father's life,

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,640
his only wish

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,320
was that I could be a soldier all my life.

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,920
But now,

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,040
I've failed him.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
After you went to the army,

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
I went to test Mr. Xiao's
blood pressure every week.

10
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
Sometimes he was sober,

11
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,520
sometimes he was not.

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,520
But as long as he was sober,

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,120
he would talk about you.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,720
He said you once fell on your head

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
when you tried to reach
a bird nest on a tree.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,880
And you once broke

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
your neighbor's window with a slingshot.

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,200
He chased you everywhere
with a stick in his hand.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
But what he talked about most

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,600
was how good your shooting was,

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
how you were good at running
when you were a child,

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
how good your performance was
in the recruit company

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
and how you entered the elite squad.

24
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
You never let him down.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,200
On the contrary,

26
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
you had always been his pride.

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,480
Chunsheng,

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
did I tell you that

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
this time on the battlefield,

30
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
I saw death for the first time?

31
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
That was a young soldier.

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,120
He stepped on a landmine
while clearing mines.

33
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
When he was sent to the hospital,

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
one of his legs had been broken.

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,440
We performed an emergency
amputation and debridement on him.

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,640
He lost so much blood

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,680
and suffered so much.

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040
He finally survived the surgery,

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
and his wounds started to heal.

40
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
But at last,

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,400
he died of infection.

42
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,510
In his last moments,

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,830
he kept his eyes open.

44
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,480
I will never forget those eyes.

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,960
That's a pair of eyes

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,520
longing to live.

47
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,400
It's not easy for me to be alive.

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,480
I have to carry the hope of my comrades

49
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
and continue to live.

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
I'll live for them.

51
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,800
My colleague helped me
contact a surgical specialist.

52
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,280
They can do such an operation.

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Xiaomei.

54
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Thank you.

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
No matter what happens,

56
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,360
as long as we're alive,

57
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,160
there is still hope.

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Hongling.

59
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,040
Xiaomei, you can go back to work.

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,080
I'll take care of Chunsheng.

61
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
Alright.

62
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Thank you, Xiaomei.

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,280
Thank you.

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
I've been busy performing recently,

65
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,880
so I didn't come to see you very often.

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Have you had Mr. Xiao's funeral?

67
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,440
Yes.

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,640
I know you are busy.

69
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,080
That's fine.

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't worry about me.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm great here.

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
The conditions are good,

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,520
and everyone takes special care of me.

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,400
And I know that

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,520
it's a critical period for you.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,320
Hongling,

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,560
how is your tour doing?

78
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Is it going well?

79
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
Hongling,

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
about my legs,

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
I didn't tell you the truth.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
I guaranteed you that

83
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
when you come to perform for us,

84
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
I would walk there.

85
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm afraid I'm going to break my promise.

86
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
That's it?

87
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,360
I just said that casually last time.

88
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
How could you recover so fast?

89
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,800
There are two shrapnel in my spine

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,600
which are compressing my nerves.

91
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
My legs

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,000
can't even move

93
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
now.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
Hongling, don't worry.

95
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
I will take a surgery in Beijing.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
There are senior experts there.

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
If the operation is successful

98
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
I can still stand up again.

99
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
But nobody can promise anything.

100
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,120
Have you thought about
the future, Chunsheng?

101
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
In the future,

102
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,200
I will still be a soldier.

103
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,160
But you know that's impossible.

104
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Xiaomei told me

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
about your condition last time.

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
She said that

107
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
even if you take the surgery,

108
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,200
you can barely walk at the best.

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,880
Chunsheng,

110
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
I understand your ideal,

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,480
your ambition

112
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,880
and your dedication to being a soldier,

113
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
but we also have to consider the reality.

114
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Regimental Commander Tao
talked to me not long ago.

115
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,800
He said that

116
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,240
after this tour is over,

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,120
he would apply

118
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,280
to make me head of the band.

119
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,600
Congratulations.

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,640
Congratulations, Hongling.

121
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
Chunsheng,

122
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Guohua told me that

123
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,320
the Organization intends to
offer you a clerical position.

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I think this is a great opportunity.

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
By that time,

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
you will also be a cadre.

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,520
Then we can report to the Organization
about our situation

128
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
and get married.

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,160
Hongling,

130
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,040
I don't want to do clerical work.

131
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
Why not?

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
You know why.

133
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
You know my childhood dream

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
was to be a real soldier.

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
But you know

136
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
that is no longer possible.

137
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,680
Can we...

138
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
Can we

139
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,200
talk about this another time?

140
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,880
Since I can remember,

141
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,320
my dream has always been

142
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,160
to serve as a soldier
and defend our country.

143
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,960
Although I couldn't realize it

144
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,200
for some external factors,

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,640
I never thought about giving up.

146
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,800
I never thought about

147
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,200
finding another way in my life.

148
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,280
Hongling,

149
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm really confused now.

150
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,400
I really don't know what to do.

151
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
You can accept the clerical work.

152
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,160
You will still stay in the army

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
and serve the country.

154
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,560
You will just be in another post.

155
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
I can't promise you anything.

156
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
There are certain risks with any surgery.

157
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,560
I don't know if I can stand up.

158
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
I don't want to choose clerical job

159
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,920
even if it means I can stay in the army.

160
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm not saying clerical jobs are bad.

161
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
I just don't think they are right for me.

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't want the army to give me a job

163
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
because of my injury.

164
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't want to be their burden.

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
I will retire

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,160
at the worst.

167
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,600
Chunsheng,

168
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
think about it.

169
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
Times have changed.

170
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,840
You should change too.

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
And I'm about to be promoted,

172
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,240
I don't want to be separated from you.

173
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,140
(Outpatient)

174
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,040
Tell me why you want to be a soldier.

175
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Sir,

176
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
I want to serve the people!

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,440
Good, you remind me of myself
when I was young.

178
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
I promise I won't let you down.

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,960
I am not guilty.

180
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,920
You are pretty arrogant.

181
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
What

182
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,240
are your plans for your future then?

183
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,760
I have no plan.

184
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,440
I'll work if they let me work,

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,360
I'll go home if they let me go home.

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
If I'm not allowed to do anything,

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll just stay here.

188
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Dad, do you know
what I admire most about you?

189
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It's

190
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,440
your spirit.

191
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,120
One should never be corrupted by wealth,

192
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
changed by poverty

193
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
and bent by force.

194
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Remember this.

195
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,360
Since you have put this uniform on,

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,680
you can't take it off!

197
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,680
Your responsibility is great,

198
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,840
because behind you is the motherland.

199
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,860
(Serve the People)

200
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,720
Hongling.

201
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
Mengmeng, why are you here?

202
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
You obviously have something
on your mind, let's talk about it.

203
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm fine.

204
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,600
You're really fine?

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,760
Hongling, we have been comrades-in-arms
for so many years.

206
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
I can't say

207
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,160
I know completely what you are thinking,

208
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,000
but I can guess part of it.

209
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you thinking about

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Ye Guohua and Xiao Chunsheng?

211
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
When I first met them,

212
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
I didn't expect that

213
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,120
they would become like this.

214
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
One became a combat hero,

215
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,920
but the other...

216
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,880
Yeah.

217
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
Who would have thought this?

218
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,240
Ye Guohua has a good family background
and a higher status,

219
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
and he's a good man.

220
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,440
Xiao Chunsheng is also not bad,

221
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,760
but now he's hurt.

222
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,280
You don't know how he
will be like in the future.

223
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Mengmeng, I...

224
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,720
So...

225
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
I'm definitely not saying

226
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,000
it's wrong to choose him.

227
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,320
It's just that,

228
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
I think, Hongling,

229
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,920
sometimes when
you are faced with choices,

230
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
should you also think about

231
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,200
some factors besides love?

232
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Everyone is not just

233
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
about himself or herself.

234
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,680
Our family

235
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
have a lot to do with our choices.

236
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,600
Anyway, I'm just a normal person.

237
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
If there were two outstanding young men

238
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,960
for me to choose,

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
I think

240
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
I would pick an easier way to go.

241
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,760
We are about to graduate.

242
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
What are your plans next?

243
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm about to find a job,

244
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
it's just not finalized yet.

245
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,520
- Hello, Chairman Chen.
- Hello, Chairman Chen.

246
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Hello.

247
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,120
Look how proud you are.

248
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,560
Of course I am proud.

249
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,800
Now the whole college knows

250
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,480
that the combat hero

251
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,680
is our childhood friend.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
They will have to count on me

253
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,000
to see his heroic image.

254
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,800
How do you want me

255
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,880
not to be proud?

256
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
Good for you.

257
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,760
You are always

258
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
like this.

259
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,040
By the way,

260
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,560
this time your brother
did such a great deed,

261
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
your parents must be very proud.

262
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,440
As his little sister,

263
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
you are not proud

264
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,000
at all?

265
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,640
Cut it out.

266
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,320
I am serious.

267
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,280
Of course I'm proud.

268
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
I just don't like to say it out.

269
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,350
You are so indifferent.

270
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
It's just vanity.

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,310
Guohua is your brother.

272
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,000
How can you say that about him?

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm not talking about him.

274
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,110
Who are you talking about then?

275
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm saying that

276
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,760
today you can be embraced because

277
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
you are a combat hero,

278
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,920
then tomorrow,
you can be despised by all

279
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,080
because of something else.

280
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
I don't like the feeling that

281
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,120
my fate is in someone else's hands.

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,800
That's why

283
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,200
when you are already at a high place,

284
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,920
you should be careful not to fall.

285
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,760
You are really not going?

286
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,960
Alright.

287
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,000
What? Don't pull the long face.

288
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
By the way, how is Chunsheng now?

289
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
He's hurt.

290
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
He's still in the hospital now.

291
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,640
It is said that

292
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,360
he was wounded in the battle

293
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,160
where my brother made military exploits.

294
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
I feel it's a little strange.

295
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
What do you mean?

296
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,640
Hard to say.

297
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,760
Between

298
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,200
my brother and Xiao Chunsheng,

299
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,160
who is more likely to

300
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,600
disregard personal safety
and organizational orders

301
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,040
to obtain information?

302
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,560
Who is more likely to

303
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,880
rescue his comrade-in-arms at all costs?

304
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,000
Ye Fang.

305
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,920
People can change.

306
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
You can't judge people with old views.

307
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
And you should trust the Organization.

308
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,140
(The core force leading our cause
is the Communist Party of China)

309
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,100
(The motherland is proud of the heroes
Honor belongs to the motherland)

310
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
(The motherland is proud of the heroes
and the people)

311
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,240
Come on, let's get in.

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Comrades, please give me a hand.

313
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,440
Thanks.

314
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,240
Thanks.

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,040
Thank you.

316
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,140
(August First)

317
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,120
After entering the army,

318
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,280
my comrades and I

319
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
have been training for war.

320
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,520
We stuck to the posts

321
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
and never dared
to slack off for a moment.

322
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,640
We hoped that one day we would
be able to serve the country

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,480
and contribute to the nation.

324
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
I am not capable enough

325
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,240
to bring all my comrades home.

326
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I don't deserve

327
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,520
to be called a combat hero.

328
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320
They

329
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,240
are more deserving of the title than me.

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,200
Today,

331
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,200
I came here with their beliefs

332
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
to salute them.

333
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,840
I was looking for you everywhere.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,840
What's on your mind?

335
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm thinking

336
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,640
what decision Chunsheng would make

337
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,960
if he were

338
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,120
in our positions.

339
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Chunsheng

340
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
would definitely
tell the truth without hesitation,

341
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
even if he would be punished.

342
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,280
He would give up everything

343
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,880
and go back to Beijing with me.

344
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
He would never give up on me

345
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
even if I would be in the wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

346
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,880
But now,

347
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,120
I don't even have the courage
to make this decision.

348
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,600
I saw what happened to my mother.

349
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,320
Back then,

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
she and my dad were deeply in love.

351
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
But later,

352
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,640
my dad passed away.

353
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,760
It was so difficult for her at that time.

354
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,560
She had to support the family and me.

355
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,600
She could only
go to the vegetable market

356
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
to do some

357
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,840
physical work.

358
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,240
She was the only woman
in the whole vegetable market.

359
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,360
She competed with those guys for a job.

360
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,960
In order to make money,

361
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
she had to

362
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,760
wash clothes for people in winter.

363
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
The water was so cold

364
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,920
that she had chilblains
all over her hands.

365
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,840
They were itching so bad
that she couldn't sleep at night,

366
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,600
but she never scratched.

367
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,400
I asked,

368
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,160
“Why are you not scratching?”

369
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,080
She said

370
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,320
she was afraid that
if she scratched it open,

371
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,120
she would stain the clients' clothes.

372
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
I know

373
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I am selfish

374
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,640
and cowardly.

375
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,960
I also despise myself like this.

376
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,680
But I really don't have the courage
to put a person's life

377
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,960
on my shoulders.

378
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
It's too heavy.

379
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,520
I'm afraid that
if I can't bear it in the future,

380
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,080
I will regret it,

381
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,520
and Chunsheng will, too.

382
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,240
Hongling,

383
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,520
I also figured something out recently.

384
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,680
You were right.

385
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
Chunsheng is a good person.

386
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
We all know that

387
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,880
he is good.

388
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,880
But I can't be him.

389
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,120
I'm just Ye Guohua.

390
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,640
I can only make choices as Ye Guohua,

391
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,960
and then

392
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
bear the consequences of it.

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,200
There is no right or wrong choice,

394
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,800
as long as we are willing
to bear the consequences.

395
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,120
Hongling,

396
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,680
as long as this report is handed in,

397
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,600
you will be head of the band.

398
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,660
(Registration Form for the Inspection of
Excellent Soldiers Training Objects)

399
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,680
You are talented.

400
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,840
And your future will be bright.

401
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,960
You have to think clearly.

402
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
Some people can't have

403
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,960
such an opportunity in a lifetime.

404
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,400
Young people are always

405
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
carried away by love.

406
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,360
But when it's over,

407
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,240
you will understand

408
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,120
that those strong feelings

409
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,000
are just an emotion.

410
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
In this world,

411
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,280
no one can't live without anyone.

412
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,200
Report!

413
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,560
Come in.

414
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,160
Is there anything else?

415
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,040
Ma'am, I want to take a leave.

416
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,040
Chunsheng!

417
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,560
Hongling.

418
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,160
Chunsheng.

419
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,000
Chunsheng, I have some good news.

420
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm head of the band now.

421
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Hongling, congratulations

422
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
on realizing your wish.

423
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,800
Hongling,

424
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,880
I know.

425
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,120
I know your love for music,

426
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,040
and that it's been your dream
since childhood.

427
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,640
I also know

428
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,120
how painful it is

429
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
to give up your ideal.

430
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
I don't want you to become another me

431
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,000
because of me.

432
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,680
But what should we do?

433
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
Mrs. Huang told me that

434
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,960
the strong feelings you feel
when you are young

435
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
are just an emotion.

436
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,040
In this world,

437
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
no one can't live without anyone.

438
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,400
But whenever the thought of

439
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,800
separating from you comes to my mind,

440
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,520
I just can't stand it.

441
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,280
Chunsheng,

442
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,960
I don't think I can be able to

443
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
like a man so much again.

444
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,680
Hongling,

445
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,160
even if I can't stand up again,

446
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,440
I will still work hard
to achieve something.

447
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,560
Will you wait for me?

448
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,000
Hongling.

449
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
Chunsheng,

450
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
I'm really scared.

451
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,120
Chunsheng,

452
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,800
you will stand up again,

453
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,440
right?

454
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,200
Promise me, okay?

455
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,200
What if I can't?

456
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,760
No!

457
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,400
Even doctors don't know what will happen.

458
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
I can't promise you.

459
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,200
If you are willing to wait for me...

460
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,280
If you are willing to wait for me, Hongling...

461
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,960
It's getting late.

462
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,200
I have a performance to attend tomorrow.

463
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,360
I will come again

464
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,200
sometime later.

I'm going back to Beijing tomorrow.

you had experienced a lot,

00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,760
maybe you had better ones.

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,660
The train will leave in an hour.

517
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,380
If you

518
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,700
want to see him,

519
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,700
you can still make it.

520
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,740
Hongling,

521
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,460
when you get this letter,

522
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,180
I have returned to Beijing.

523
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,820
I didn't tell you in advance

524
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,740
because I don't want you

525
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,220
to be in a dilemma

526
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,900
because of me.

527
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,100
Right from the beginning at Shichahai,

528
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,460
we've been stuck in this cycle.

529
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,860
Ideal or reality?

530
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,020
Compromise with life

531
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,020
or stick to your heart?

532
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,740
We are like two parallel lines

533
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,900
trying to get closer to each other.

534
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,620
But it seems that there is
always a long distance in between.

535
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,020
We all gained too much

536
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,820
and also missed too much.

537
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,380
When I look back on those years,

538
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,900
it's like the outside world

539
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,420
has been pushing us to change.

540
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,740
But now

541
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,420
it's time for us

542
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,380
to choose the life we want to pursue.

543
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,140
Hongling.

544
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,980
It's about to start.

545
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,820
Where are you going?

546
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,140
Chunsheng is going back to Beijing.

547
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,900
So,

548
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,980
you are going to chase him?

549
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,020
Have you thought about the show?

550
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,620
Hongling,

551
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,220
everyone is waiting for you.

552
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,500
If you leave,

553
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,740
the show will be a disaster.

554
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,540
And are you sure

555
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,340
you can get Chunsheng back?

556
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,620
Hongling,

557
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,220
you worked so hard for this opportunity.

558
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,420
Leaving now

559
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,980
is like giving up your dreams.

560
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,220
This is the last show.

561
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,140
As long as you complete this task,

562
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,980
you will be head of the band.

563
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,300
Are you really going to

564
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,020
give up your hard-won opportunity?

565
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,820
I hope you choose me,

566
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,100
but I also hope you choose

567
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,620
the life you want.

568
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
I hope you can realize your dream.

569
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,460
I support your choice

570
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,500
and wish you good luck,

571
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,660
no matter where

572
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,420
this choice will take us.

573
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,580
Hongling,

574
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,980
I will have my own path in the future,

575
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,380
but whatever happens,

576
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,780
I hope

577
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,740
we can both march firmly

578
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,340
on the paths we choose.
