3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
To make some money,

4
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,160
I can sell my charms

5
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
and commit myself to her.

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,200
It's a sacrifice but I'm fine.

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,360
You? Commit yourself?

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
You don't even know if she wants you.

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,640
There it is. It's open.

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
Leave me alone!

11
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Go!

12
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,860
(Trade Fair Month of
Winter Clothing, Shoes and Hats)

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
Come and see!

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
- Come and have a look.
- Woolen scarves.

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,360
Madam, do you want a scarf?

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,520
Come on.

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Have a look.

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,800
Newly arrived woolen scarves.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,240
This one.

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,280
Excuse me,

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,880
how much is your scarf?

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,030
Not expensive, only ten yuan each.

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,800
Ten yuan?

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,440
Ten yuan each.

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,000
It'd only cost
six or seven yuan in the store.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,240
It's cheaper in the store indeed,

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,360
but it's hard to get one there.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
What he said is right.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
It's hard to get
woolen scarves like this.

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
It's out of stock in the store.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
Look, what she said makes perfect sense.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,080
Wise lady.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
We have gone

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
through a lot

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
to find these scarves.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
Okay, I'll buy one.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,960
Sure!

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,400
I want two scarves.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,840
- Sure.
- Thank you, madam.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,960
I want one.

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,200
Sure.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Have a look. Our scarves will
make you youthful and happy,

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,400
and bring you good luck
in your friendship and career.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,920
Come on.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Come on. This one.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,840
Look at this one.

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,360
Xiaohui, how much money have we made?

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,840
Think about it.

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,720
We went to the Department Store

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,920
and bought 40 scarves.

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
The profit per scarf is three yuan.

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,280
So we have earned 120 yuan.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,880
120 yuan in only a few hours?

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,920
It's worth it to queue up at night.

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
We should keep doing this.

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Heizi,

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,320
this is a lucrative business.

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,920
For sure.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Unfortunately,

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,960
we don't have this chance every day.

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,000
That's already good enough.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
120 yuan

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
is about two months' wages of my father.

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,440
You should be happy.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Heizi, how do we divide the money?

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,720
Darling,

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,680
give it to me.

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Cap-opener,

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
here's ten yuan for you.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Buy a small gift

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,680
for your classmate,

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,520
I mean, that chubby girl.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,040
Why should I buy a gift for her?

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,880
Boy, how ungrateful you are.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,280
Do you still remember that
she did us a favor?

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,680
This classmate of yours

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,640
provided us with information

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
and saved some scarves for us.

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,320
You have to thank her.

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
As long as we remain friends,
we can get another chance like this again.

82
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,320
We can't make it a one-time deal.

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,360
Take it.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,200
That makes sense.

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
- Take it.
- Hurry up.

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,920
Okay then.

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll go to the store in Xidan

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,160
to buy her a brooch.

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
She likes brooches.

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,520
That's right.

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,640
Heizi, then what should we do
with the rest of the money?

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
We have 110 yuan left.

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,640
Well,

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,510
take ten yuan out of it first,

95
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,950
then the rest 100 yuan will be
divided equally among us four.

96
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,240
However,

97
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,040
we can't spend the money now.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,440
Why?

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,880
We're short of funds now.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
We could only buy these 40 scarves

101
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,880
after saving money

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
in every possible way.

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,120
If we have more money,

104
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,200
then we can buy more

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
and earn more.

106
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
Heizi is right.

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,320
I agree.

108
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,040
Then

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
what about the ten yuan you took out?

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
The ten yuan I took out...

111
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
Let's eat out.

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,120
Okay.

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,880
How about that?

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
What should we eat?

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,800
What do you want to eat?

116
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,440
We haven't had
roasted duck for a long time.

117
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,080
Let's have roasted duck
near Hepingmen.

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,680
Okay.

119
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,200
Let's go.

120
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,800
- Get on the tricycle.
- Let's go.

121
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Go.

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Come on.

123
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
Let's go!

124
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
Ouch...

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,920
Bean sprouts and peanuts

126
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,160
taste worse than roasted duck indeed.

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
Of course they taste worse.

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
If you want to eat good food,
work hard.

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
Earn more money so you can
have roasted duck every day.

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
Okay.

131
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,160
Listen,

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,680
if you really want to
have roasted duck every day,

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
apart from working hard,

134
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,120
you have to figure out
ways to make money.

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,640
We have few ways to make money now.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah.

137
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,760
Apart from woolen scarves,

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
we have to figure out

139
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
other profitable items we can sell.

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
By the way, Cap-opener left to see

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,040
that girl a long time ago

142
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
and he still hasn't returned.

143
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,960
Listen,

144
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,760
they're quite close now.

145
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
Maybe he treated her to a big dinner.

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm back!

147
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,240
Speak of the devil.

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,200
Come on, sit down.

149
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,680
How's it going?

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,480
Did you have fun with that chubby girl?

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
Heizi,

152
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,400
you're awesome.

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,840
Your idea is brilliant.

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
When I gave her the brooch,

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
her eyes lit up.

156
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,520
Then I treated her

157
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,080
to steamed stuffed buns and liver fry.

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Guess what?

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,640
She told me
another chance to make money.

160
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,680
What chance?

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,720
Say it now.

162
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,880
She told me

163
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,320
that military boots from Tianjin
are highly sought after now.

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,760
They often go to Tianjin

165
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,400
to purchase

166
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
and the boots

167
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
will be sold out in a minute.

168
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,640
Military boots.

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,120
I've seen them.

170
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,120
Those warm

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,080
ankle boots

172
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,840
made of calfskin. Right?

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,440
Yes.

174
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,640
Then ask her

175
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
when the store
will start selling the boots.

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,200
Save some for us.

177
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
She told me

178
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,400
not to purchase from the store.

179
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
The price there is higher.

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
If we want to purchase the boots,
we should go to Tianjin.

181
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
If we make a purchase in Tianjin

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,120
other than from the store,

183
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
then we can earn 5% more.

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,280
Tianjin?

185
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,560
Then we have to get there by train.

186
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,120
It's too far.

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Don't worry.

188
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Let's calculate it.

189
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,400
Now, a pair of military boots

190
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
will sell for about 26 or 27 yuan

191
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,200
in the store.

192
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
We're not asking for too much profit.

193
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,480
Let's raise the price
by five yuan per pair.

194
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
If we purchase them in Tianjin,

195
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,680
then we can earn two or three yuan more.

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
So the profit will be eight yuan.

197
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
It takes about 20 yuan

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,360
for us four

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,040
to make a round trip

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,320
between Beijing and Tianjin.

201
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,680
This is profitable.

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Yes, yes, it's profitable.

203
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,880
Then how about

204
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
you go there without me?

205
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
It saves one train ticket.

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
Why do you have to save money now?

207
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you know how heavy
a pair of military boots is?

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,760
If you go with us,
then we can carry more boots.

209
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,200
The profit of one pair of boots

210
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,240
will be enough
to cover your train ticket cost.

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Also,

212
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,120
we can visit Tianjin.

213
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
Let's try

214
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
that Goubuli steamed stuffed buns

215
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,440
and see what makes them

216
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,360
different from our ones.

217
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,440
The fried dough twists there
are also tasty.

218
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,040
And the ear-hole fried cakes too.

219
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Yes!

220
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,280
Okay.

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
High-quality military boots.

222
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,040
Made of shiny calfskin.

223
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,800
Size 37.

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
Size 37. Let me have a look.

225
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
Sir, what size do you wear?

226
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,880
Come on, this way!

227
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,080
Okay.

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Come on.

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Come and have a look!

230
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Military boots!

231
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,910
These are all size 43 ones!

232
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,670
Yes, we have all sizes.

233
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,030
Choose the size you wear.

234
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
High-quality military boots!

235
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
It's so early.

236
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000
Why did you ask me to go outside?

237
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,600
The weather is good

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,520
and you're having a day off.

239
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,360
I just wanted to take you outside.

240
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,880
Where do you want to go?

241
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,040
Nowhere special. I'm just cycling around.

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
I just want to take you outside to relax.

243
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,720
Heizi, we're getting
fewer and fewer customers.

244
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,760
Of course.

245
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Do you know what time it is?

246
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,040
It's not the time people get off work,

247
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
of course there won't be
many customers here.

248
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,880
Anyway,

249
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,640
we sold one third
of the boots in the morning.

250
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,240
That's good enough.

251
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,400
Then should we stay here?

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
I don't think we can sell more.

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,360
Let's go home.

254
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,400
Go home?

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,200
Do you have anything else planned?

256
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,720
Even if we go home,
we won't have much to do.

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Let's just stay here.

258
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
More people will come here

259
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,400
when they get off work.

260
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Maybe we can sell seven or eight pairs.

261
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
Okay, hang in there.

262
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,520
Hello, Xiaohui!

263
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
Hello, Yanqiu.

264
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,360
Tian!

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Hello, Tian.

266
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
Tian, I haven't seen you for a long time.

267
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
I mean,

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
what brought you here today?

269
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,760
Nothing brought me here.

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
I cycled here.

271
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
Tian, so you're not busy today.

272
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Right. You're not busy today either.

273
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm here to visit you.

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,320
Good.

275
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Xiaohui,

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
you're getting prettier and prettier now.

277
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,640
Look at your rosy cheeks.

278
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Yanqiu, I'm afraid
I'm not getting prettier.

279
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
My face is red because of the cold.

280
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Where did you get so many military boots?

281
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
We took an overnight train

282
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
to carry them back
from Tianjin Quanye Bazaar.

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
Why did you have to buy so many of them?

284
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,040
To earn money, of course.

285
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Earn money?

286
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,320
How can you make money with them?

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Tian, we haven't seen you for a while
and you're already behind the times.

288
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,080
What you don't know is

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
that we have started a stand to sell things

290
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
for some time.

291
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,920
You haven't seen it

292
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
so you don't know it.

293
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
Now I see.

294
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,360
So you're just

295
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
profiteers.

296
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
Tian, you despise us, don't you?

297
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
That doesn't sound nice.

298
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
But I'm telling the truth.

299
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,320
What you're doing

300
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,760
is precisely buying
and selling speculatively, isn't it?

301
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
Tian is right.

302
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Buying and selling, indeed.

303
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Buying and selling.

304
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,880
We buy them,
and sell them at a higher price.

305
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Simple as that.

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
Tian, don't underestimate

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,080
us small business owners.

308
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
Do you know how much money we can earn

309
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
with these boots?

310
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,080
I don't know.

311
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,560
I'd love to know it though.

312
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Tian,

313
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,480
please stand straight.

314
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Come on, help me.

315
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
We purchased these boots

316
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,440
from Tianjin Quanye Bazaar

317
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
at the price of 23 yuan per pair.

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,760
In Beijing,

319
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I raised the price

320
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,040
to 32 yuan per pair.

321
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,480
Nine yuan for one pair?

322
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,240
Lower your voice, please.

323
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Tian, each of us
carried ten pairs this time,

324
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
so there are 40 pairs in total.

325
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,360
Calculate it.

326
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
How much money can we make
if we sell them all?

327
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,040
360 yuan.

328
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
That's fast.

329
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
Also, Yanqiu,

330
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
I guarantee you

331
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,280
that we can sell all of these

332
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,440
in two days.

333
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
360 yuan in two days?

334
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
You're getting rich!

335
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,200
Far from that, Tian.

336
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,320
Honestly,

337
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
we've been doing this

338
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
for about one month,

339
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,000
right?

340
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah.

341
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,880
And we've earned

342
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,720
nearly 2,000 yuan in total.

343
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
Two thousand in a month?

344
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,360
Even high-rank officials
can't earn this much.

345
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,720
That's not much, Yanqiu.

346
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,920
People you call

347
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,840
profiteers and pedicab drivers

348
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
can all earn over 10,000 yuan now.

349
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,760
Ten thousand?

350
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
Hurry up.

351
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
Tell me about it.

352
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,800
You're anxious.

353
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Cap-opener, Tian is anxious.

354
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Do you want to know about it?

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,640
Now!

356
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,400
I have nothing to do now.

357
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,440
I understand.

358
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,200
Well,

359
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
since you're here now,

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
that's all for our business today.

361
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,920
Yanji cold noodles.

362
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,120
I'll treat you to cold noodles
and draft beer.

363
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,160
You've earned this much

364
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,720
yet you only want to
treat me to cold noodles?

365
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Exactly.

366
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,400
Tian and Yanqiu

367
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,240
finally came to visit us

368
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,840
yet you only want to
treat them to cold noodles.

369
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,800
You're so stingy.

370
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Why are you against me?

371
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Stop it.

372
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
I'm the one in charge here.

373
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,040
Let's go to a Western restaurant.

374
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,240
One month?

375
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
You've bought and sold these many things

376
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
in only one month?

377
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
Tian,

378
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,400
things are in shortage now,

379
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
especially those popular items.

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
After the store starts

381
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
to sell them,

382
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,320
they will be sold in a second.

383
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,440
So we're looking

384
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
for information every day.

385
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Once we know

386
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,760
that there are popular items in a store,

387
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,680
we will queue up at night to buy

388
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,960
as many as we can.

389
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,160
Then we will sell them at a higher price.

390
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Simple as that.

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,480
So your business requires hard work too.

392
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Exactly.

393
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
Tian, Yanqiu,

394
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,240
I want to tell you

395
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
that

396
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,160
this month,

397
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,080
I have yet to have a good sleep.

398
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,200
Every midnight,

399
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,400
we have to queue up

400
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,960
outside the store.

401
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,640
Then we will take the goods
to the station to sell them.

402
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,320
We have to stay there all day.

403
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
Actually, as long as I can earn money,

404
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
I don't mind working hard.

405
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,080
However, there are
so few popular items out there.

406
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,600
We have to ask around

407
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
to find out which store has them.

408
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,120
Yeah.

409
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,800
Sometimes, we can't get the goods

410
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,280
in a week.

411
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
I see.

412
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,400
Buying and selling.

413
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,400
Interesting.

414
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
That's right, Tian.

415
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,640
It's just buying and selling.

416
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,840
Nothing complicated.

417
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,200
Just work with us.

418
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,520
Right.

419
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
Well, forget about it.

420
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,480
You four work so hard every day

421
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
yet you still don't make much money.

422
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
How can I take your profit?

423
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,520
Well...

424
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,600
Tian, that's not true.

425
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,080
You're not taking our profit.

426
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,520
We're friends.

427
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,040
Also,

428
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,880
everyone in Beijing
has heard of your name.

429
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
You're smart, you know a lot of people

430
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
and you have lots of connections.

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,640
Tian, if you want to work with us

432
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
and teach us,

433
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,360
then we can make money easily.

434
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,920
Actually, I agree with Xiaohui.

435
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,640
Qi Tian is full of ideas

436
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,480
and petty tricks.

437
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
What are you talking about?

438
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm praising you.

439
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
You call this praise?

440
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,680
I'm serious, Tian.

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,480
Xiaohui,

442
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,680
Cap, Cap-opener and I

443
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,080
are sincerely hoping

444
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,920
that you can join us.

445
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's forget the profit for a second.

446
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,280
If we work together,

447
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,200
at least we will be happy. Right?

448
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,680
Yes.

449
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,360
We will be happy.

450
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,800
So, please

451
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
think about it carefully.

452
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,400
Then I'll think about it.

453
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Please do.

454
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Come on, Tian.

455
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,960
Cheers.

456
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,920
What are you thinking about?

457
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,720
About you.

458
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,640
About...

459
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,440
About what you told me.

460
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
What did I say?

461
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,120
Actually, I've been wondering

462
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,120
what I should do

463
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,120
in the future these days.

464
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,240
I can earn money

465
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,480
by doing odd jobs,

466
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
but that won't work in the long term.

467
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
There will be a day
when I'm unable to do physical labor.

468
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
And I don't have the skills

469
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
to do other jobs.

470
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Then what do you think?

471
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,680
What Heizi said

472
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,040
truly inspired me a lot.

473
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,280
Those who grew up in hutongs like us

474
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,400
do not have much knowledge

475
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
and didn't receive much education either.

476
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Despite this,

477
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
they managed to earn 2,000 yuan
in such a short time.

478
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,320
Two thousand!

479
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
Even the workers in factories

480
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,120
can only earn about
40 to 50 yuan a month.

481
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,560
That's 500 yuan a year at most.

482
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Four years' salary earned in a month.

483
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,000
And they managed to do this

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,640
when they had no information,
channels or popular goods.

485
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,160
If they have the channel

486
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,310
to get popular goods every day,

487
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,520
then it won't be hard for them

488
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,160
to earn about 10,000 yuan a month.

489
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
Well,

490
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
when I was young,

491
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
I wanted to become a soldier.

492
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,720
I wanted to work
in state-owned enterprises

493
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,840
or big factories.

494
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,080
I thought that'd be
the most honorable thing.

495
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,560
I'd never thought about making money.

496
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,000
In the past, they caught me

497
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,000
and called me a profiteer.

498
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,520
But look,

499
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,160
the profiteers now are all rich.

500
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't complain.

501
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,920
It's a different time now.

502
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
But I think

503
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,840
you have the capability.

504
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I think you can succeed

505
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,360
no matter what.

506
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,480
I've figured it out too.

507
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
I'll pick myself up

508
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,960
from where I fell.

509
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,160
I'll figure out

510
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,840
buying and selling.

511
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,720
Okay.

512
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,280
Then I'll help you

513
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,120
if there's anything I can do.

514
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,840
I don't need your help.

515
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,160
I mean...

516
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,400
You'll be my business partner.

517
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,680
Isn't that okay?

518
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Really?

519
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
Why are you here so early?

520
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,960
Didn't I tell you yesterday

521
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
to ask for a leave

522
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
and get up early this morning?

523
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,640
Then let's go.

524
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,520
Go to see Heizi.

525
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,720
Why should we see him?

526
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
You want to be a profiteer, don't you?

527
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,520
We have to join them
to sell military boots.

528
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,280
You're so forgetful.

529
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,360
What did I say yesterday?

530
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,120
They worked so hard to get these boots.

531
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,000
If I joined them,

532
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,560
I'd take their profit.

533
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,160
I can't do this.

534
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,800
Then what are we going to do?

535
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Let's

536
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
have a look in the stores

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
to see what items are popular.

538
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,920
That is,

539
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
to see what people need.

540
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,440
To find the goods?

541
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,800
More or less so.

542
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,200
Field survey.

543
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Go.

544
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's go.

545
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
One, two, three.

546
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,760
Go.

547
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
Military boots!

548
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,400
- Nice boots!
- Newest military boots!

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,160
Military boots!

550
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
Come and have a look!

551
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Military boots! Military boots!

552
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,440
Don't miss it!

553
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,960
Come and have a look!

554
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,920
What are you looking for?

555
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
Who looked at you?

556
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,040
What's wrong with you?

557
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
I wonder

558
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
if Tian and Yanqiu will come today.

559
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,440
Why do you want to know this?

560
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Tian was clearly
interested in it yesterday.

561
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
Maybe they will come

562
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,600
and join us today.

563
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,240
Correct.

564
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,760
When we said

565
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
we'd earned 2,000 yuan in a month,

566
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
Tian's eyes lit up.

567
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,800
No doubt.

568
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,160
They will join us for sure.

569
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
Listen,

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
Qi Tian won't show up today.

571
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,920
Why?

572
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,960
You really don't know him, do you?

573
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,720
Do you know
what kind of person Qi Tian is?

574
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
If he came to join us now

575
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
and sell the boots together with us,

576
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,000
then he'd take our profit.

577
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,280
Of course Qi Tian

578
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,840
won't profit himself

579
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,840
at the expense of his friends.

580
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Well,

581
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,320
that makes sense too.

582
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,160
Tian isn't that kind of person indeed.

583
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,560
Heizi, so you mean

584
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,120
he won't join us?

585
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,360
No, he will join us.

586
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,560
But not now.

587
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,600
If one day

588
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
Tian finds a new way

589
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,840
to make money,

590
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,560
then he will ask us

591
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
to follow him.

592
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
This is Qi Tian,

593
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,400
our big brother.

594
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
True.

595
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,800
Tian knows a lot of people

596
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
and he's smart too.

597
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,840
Maybe he can really
find ways to make money

598
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
that are beyond our imagination.

599
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,200
Folks,

600
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960
hang in there.

601
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
Just wait.

602
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,960
When Tian

603
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,960
gets the knack

604
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,520
of doing business,

605
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,280
we're not far away from getting rich.

606
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,400
Military boots!

607
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,920
You scared me.

608
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,960
- What's wrong with you?
- Military boots!

609
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,960
- Military boots!
- Military boots!

610
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,080
Madam, have a look at our military boots!

611
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,440
- Come and have a look!
- Military boots!

612
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
Lower your head
or you may hit it on the branches.

613
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay.

614
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
We've looked around for a day

615
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,880
and I don't see any ways to make money.

616
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,680
That's enough.

617
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,080
I mean, it has only been one day.

618
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,440
If the ways to make money

619
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
could be learned in one day,

620
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,800
then everyone would be rich.

621
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Then what?

622
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,160
Should I ask for another leave tomorrow

623
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,640
to accompany you again?

624
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
The ancients said,

625
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,200
victory is ensured when you
know both yourself and the enemy.

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,560
Our ancestors couldn't lie to us.

627
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
This is also the rule of business.

628
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
You have to understand the market,

629
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
know what is easy to buy and easy to sell,

630
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,360
and what is lucrative

631
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,280
before taking actions.

632
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
It's so complicated.
I can't understand it anyway.

633
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,320
Then I'll just listen to you.

634
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,560
Actually,

635
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm not that sure

636
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,800
either.

637
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Well,

638
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
let me think about it further

639
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,160
then we can discuss it.

640
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,800
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

641
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Time for you to go home now.

642
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
I'll also go to bed.

643
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Take care on your way back.

644
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,840
He Hongling! There's a call for you!

645
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,720
Hongling, a call for you.

646
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,880
A call for me?

647
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,680
You're the only one
who has numerous calls.

648
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,320
Is this the platoon leader

649
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,240
or that childhood friend?

650
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
Okay, stop it.

651
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,080
Go, Hongling.

652
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,160
Hello,

653
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,000
this is He Hongling.

654
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,480
Hongling, this is Uncle Dong.

655
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,040
Your mother had another heart attack,

656
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,840
and she's in 301 Hospital.

657
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,600
Guohua, my mom had another heart attack.

658
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,360
The doctor said
she had to have surgery right now.

659
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,480
Can you please contact

660
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,800
that Professor Su
you mentioned last time for me?

661
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,800
I'll make a call now!

662
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay, thank you.

663
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,980
(Work Notes)

664
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,320
Guohua, last time we were in the queue

665
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,040
for about two weeks
before seeing Professor Su.

666
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
However, this time my mom is
in urgent need for treatment,

667
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,280
we can't wait this long.
What should we do?

668
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,040
Don't worry.
Even if Professor Su is unavailable,

669
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
there will be other doctors for sure.

670
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,080
Now we're in a much better place,

671
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,680
there will be better doctors
to treat your mom for sure.

672
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,360
Don't worry.

673
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,000
I regret it so much.

674
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,200
I shouldn't have refused your help then.

675
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
When you're in Beijing,

676
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,440
contact me anytime if you need help.

677
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,440
I'm always here.

678
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,900
(In use Silent Operating Room)

679
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,640
Uncle Dong!

680
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,200
You're back.

681
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,280
How's my mom?

682
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
She's inside.

683
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,280
How long will it take?

684
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,720
It should be fast.

685
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,560
Don't worry, she will be okay.

686
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
Thank you, Uncle.

687
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,640
Isn't this Comrade Xiao?

688
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,840
Are you here to see Hongling?

689
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,800
Right. Today we have a day off,

690
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
so I asked Hongling

691
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,520
to go to the bookstore
in the city together.

692
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,440
Go to the bookstore?

693
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,800
Today?

694
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,080
You don't know it yet?

695
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,480
What happened?

696
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
Hongling left for home yesterday,

697
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,720
she's not here now.

698
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,320
What do you mean?

699
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
So you really don't know it?

700
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,080
I heard that her mom suddenly fell ill

701
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
and had to have surgery immediately.

702
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
So she went back to Beijing in a hurry.

703
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,640
Wait!

704
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,400
Report!

705
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,840
Come in!

706
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,360
Guohua, I heard
Hongling returned to Beijing yesterday.

707
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,160
Her mom was hospitalized
and had to have surgery.

708
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Do you know that?

709
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Chunsheng, sit down.

710
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
After contacting the doctor for her,

711
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,480
I took Hongling directly to the airport.

712
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,080
I was in such a hurry

713
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,040
that I forgot to tell you.

714
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
Don't worry,

715
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
her mom's surgery was a success.

716
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,960
No worries.

717
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,840
The surgery was a success?

718
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,920
You arranged this?

719
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
Last time her mom was ill,

720
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,600
I contacted Professor Su for Hongling.

721
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,760
So this time, she came straight to me,

722
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
asking me if I could call Professor Su.

723
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,160
Professor Su happened to be attending
a meeting in Guangzhou,

724
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,880
so I found

725
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,840
another good doctor for her.

726
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,400
Chunsheng,

727
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
are you angry with me?

728
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,400
How can I be angry with you?

729
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
If not for you,

730
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Hongling's mom couldn't have
got the surgery this quickly.

731
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,680
This is cardiac surgery

732
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,320
and is highly difficult.

733
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,600
I understand.

734
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,160
Guess you've stayed up all night too.

735
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,760
Have a rest.

736
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,840
I'll leave now.

737
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,720
Okay.

738
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,320
Guohua,

739
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,800
can you tell me
the phone number of the hospital?

740
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,160
I'll write it down for you.

741
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,360
Okay. Have a good rest.

742
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,640
Goodbye.

743
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,460
(Nurse Station)

744
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,040
Hello?

745
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,440
Hello, is this Hongling?

746
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
This is Chunsheng speaking.

747
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,160
Chunsheng, how did you know this number?

748
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,560
I just went to your dormitory to see you,

749
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,520
and your comrade-in-arms told me
that you returned to Beijing yesterday.

750
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,320
So I went to see Guohua in a hurry.

751
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,760
I'm sorry.

752
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,480
I was too anxious yesterday

753
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,400
and forgot to tell you this.

754
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,920
It's okay.

755
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,720
Oh,

756
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
how's your mom?

757
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
She's doing well.

758
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,200
The doctor Guohua found is excellent.

759
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
The nurses here told me

760
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,440
that in Beijing, he and
Professor Su are the only ones

761
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
who can perform
valve replacement surgery.

762
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,680
At first, my mom's surgery could
only be scheduled for next month,

763
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,120
however, another patient

764
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,600
failed the preoperative
evaluation yesterday

765
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,360
and had to wait further,

766
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,800
so my mom got the place instead.

767
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,920
We really have to thank Guohua for this.

768
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
Oh, and Uncle Dong too.

769
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,760
My mom hasn't been
feeling well these days

770
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,240
and she complained to Uncle Dong.

771
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,040
Fortunately, he remembered it.

772
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,480
He went to my home to check on her,

773
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,800
and after knocking for a while,
nobody answered.

774
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,280
He was afraid that something
might go wrong, so he forced his way in

775
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,040
and found that my mom
had fainted on the ground.

776
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,960
He took her to the hospital immediately.

777
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,280
Fortunately, your mom is doing well now.

778
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,280
Well,

779
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
I'll thank Uncle Dong later.

780
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,520
Hongling,

781
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
how much

782
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,560
did the surgery cost?

783
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,440
1,500 yuan.

784
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,280
The follow-up treatment in hospital

785
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,760
will cost about
one or two thousand at least.

786
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,280
Guohua said he'd pay it for me,
but I declined.

787
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
It's okay, Hongling.

788
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,040
Take it easy.

789
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,960
Take good care of your mom

790
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,720
and I'll take care of the rest.

791
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,800
In a word,

792
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,200
trust me.

793
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,440
We can overcome any problems.

794
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay. I'll wait for your call.

795
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,320
By the way, Hongling,

796
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,720
you...

797
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,560
Look after yourself.

798
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,760
Don't get exhausted.

799
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,900
(Reception Office)

800
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,720
Hello, Yanqiu.

801
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
It's me, Chunsheng.

802
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,520
Yanqiu, I wonder

803
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,160
how much money we have now.

804
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,560
What happened?

805
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,520
Um...

806
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,040
It's...

807
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,200
It's Hongling.

808
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,320
Her mom is hospitalized

809
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,200
and had surgery.

810
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm afraid it will cost

811
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,960
nearly 4,000 yuan in total.

812
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
That's too much.

813
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,160
How can we afford it?

814
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,400
Yanqiu, calm down, please.

815
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,640
Just tell me
how much money we have now.

816
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,320
I'll find a way to get the rest.

817
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,200
The rest of your salary

818
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,240
plus the money
you sent home from the army

819
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,040
are about 400 yuan.

820
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,040
A while ago, Dad received
800 yuan in back pay.

821
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,880
We don't have much money other than that.

822
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
My factory is not doing well now

823
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,800
and I gave the money
I received in back pay a while ago

824
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,560
to Qi Tian for his business.

825
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
I see.

826
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,040
Yanqiu,

827
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,040
can you lump the money

828
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
you have now together?

829
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,760
I'll find a way

830
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
to get the rest,

831
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,080
okay?

832
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,840
Oh, by the way,

833
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,800
her mom is in 301 Hospital.

834
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,520
Bed No. 34.

835
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,960
Yes, I see.

836
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,340
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

837
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Nice skills.

838
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,880
No need

839
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,280
to pretend.

840
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,640
We know you need money.

841
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,040
Exactly.

842
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,600
No need to be this upset.

843
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,240
No, I can't accept this.

844
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,240
Amao has a whole family

845
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
to support.

846
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,600
And Lei's elderly mother lives alone.

847
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
I know it well.

848
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
As for Jinzhu...

849
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Enough.

850
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
You weren't this sentimental before.

851
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,080
We send money home regularly,

852
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,800
it won't hurt much.

853
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,120
Focus on your own business.

854
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,240
Count it.

855
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,160
If it's not enough,
we will try to get more.

856
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,240
Quick.

857
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,840
Come on.

858
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,960
- Count it.
- Now.

859
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,760
Plus mine, there's 249 yuan in total.

860
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,920
I should have saved more money.

861
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
Look how stingy you are.

862
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,150
Are you going to starve yourself?

863
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,320
It should be enough for the surgery

864
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,190
and I don't need to
pay for the rest at the moment.

865
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,190
I'll think of other ways.

866
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,190
Don't worry.

867
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,320
We will try to borrow more money too.

868
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

869
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,360
Brothers, thank you.

870
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,840
I'll never forget your kindness.

871
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
Don't be corny.

872
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,710
Listen,

873
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,920
ask the Company Commander
for a leave now

874
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,040
and go to the city
to transfer the money tomorrow.

875
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,480
Right. Use wire transfer,

876
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,230
it's quicker.

877
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,150
Use a few cents to send a telegram.

878
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,600
Yes.

879
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,150
Yes.

880
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,840
Then I...

881
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,150
- Hurry up.
- Go.

882
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,760
Go.

883
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,280
Thank you!

884
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,640
Stenosis is caused by aging

885
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,280
and calcification of her aortic valve.

886
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,720
As a result, blood flow from the heart

887
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,880
to the body is reduced.

888
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,560
Your mother had a severe case then,

889
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,680
that's why she suffered from shock.

890
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Now,

891
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,960
I think the surgery

892
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
has fixed the aortic valve problem

893
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,160
quite nicely.

894
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,920
The artificial valve fits well

895
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,840
and is working without problems now.

896
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,080
That's all.

897
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,080
In a word, her condition

898
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,760
is much more stable now.

899
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,440
Her diet in the future
should be low in salt and fat.

900
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,080
When her scar heals to some extent,

901
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
she can get out of bed and walk.

902
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
But she can't be tired or catch a cold.

903
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,640
Okay.

904
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
Prevent respiratory infections.

905
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,560
I know the cost
of the anticoagulant medication

906
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,160
will be a big burden on your family,

907
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,600
however, it is a must
for postoperative treatment.

908
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
She has to keep taking the medication

909
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,480
and have her blood clotting
function checked regularly.

910
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,960
Okay, I see.

911
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,960
Thank you.

912
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,780
(Nurse Station)

913
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,120
Are you the family
of the patient in Bed No. 34?

914
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,040
Yes.

915
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,920
When will you pay for the surgery?

916
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,320
Well,

917
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,200
can you please give me more time?

918
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,840
We've given you two extra days.

919
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Other patients paid first
before undergoing surgery.

920
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
We're just abiding by the rules,

921
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,000
please don't make things difficult for us.

922
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,200
Then

923
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
can I make a call?

924
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,200
Okay, go ahead.

925
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,680
Hello, may I ask who is calling?

926
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,800
Hello,

927
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,920
my name is He Hongling

928
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,800
and I want to speak to Platoon Leader Ye.

929
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,520
Hello, Comrade He Hongling.

930
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,000
Platoon Leader Ye has told me

931
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,160
that if you call him,

932
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,120
I should let him know.

933
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
Please wait for a while.

934
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,720
Thank you.

935
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
You're welcome.

936
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,960
I'll tell him now.

937
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
Sir, there's a call for you.

938
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,320
Eat your food.

939
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,200
Why are you in a daze now?

940
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,480
Okay. I'll eat.

941
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,080
Chunsheng, don't worry.

942
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,960
They told you that it should
arrive by noon, didn't they?

943
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
She can pay the hospital today for sure.

944
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,160
Yeah, don't worry.

945
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,440
Anyway, we've done everything we can.

946
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:46,960
Yes.

947
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
We will be paid in a few days

948
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,880
and we will transfer this money then.

949
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't worry.

950
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,600
Come on, eat.

951
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,880
Eat.

952
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,800
Hello, Hongling, it's me.

953
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,840
Guohua, I'm very sorry.

954
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,560
The hospital is pressing me
to pay for the surgery.

955
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,600
Yes, I understand.

956
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,360
How much do you need?

957
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,280
The surgery

958
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,520
costs 1,500 yuan.

959
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,880
What about the follow-up treatment?

960
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
The hospitalization costs 30 yuan a day

961
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,920
and it's about 40 yuan for the treatment.

962
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,720
It will be about 2,000 yuan

963
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,000
for a month.

964
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,400
Well,

965
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,560
I'll ask Ye Fang
to bring you 5,000 yuan first.

966
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,360
If you need more, call me later.

967
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
Thank you, Guohua.

968
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,640
You're welcome.

969
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,440
Guohua, you've really helped me so much.

970
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,840
I'll return the money to you in the future.

971
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,480
Hongling, I truly want to help you.

972
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,320
Don't think too much.

973
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
By the way, have you had your meal?

974
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,320
Not yet.

975
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,360
Go eat then,

976
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,760
call me again if you need help.

977
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,880
Okay.

978
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,760
Chunsheng.

979
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,820
(Training to be the best soldiers)

980
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,120
(Nurse Station)
I've paid for the surgery.

981
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,320
Here is the remaining 3,500 yuan,

982
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,320
it should be able to last
for one month and a half.

983
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,840
Thank you.

984
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,120
I will return the money to you
in the future.

985
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,200
You don't need to tell me this.

986
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,200
It's really not my business.

987
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,400
However, my brother is a fool.

988
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,280
Don't say this.

989
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,080
Okay.

990
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,560
Anyway, I came here
to ask you a question.

991
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,080
Go ahead.

992
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,360
Do you regret choosing Xiao Chunsheng?

993
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm sure now you know

994
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,560
that life is more than
the Shichahai Ice Rink.

995
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,720
And Xiao Chunsheng, that outstanding

996
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,880
and glittering hero on the ice,

997
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,840
is merely someone
who doesn't even have 1,500 yuan

998
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,720
in real life.

999
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,720
Ye Fang, I know you look down on me.

1000
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,080
However, am I not worthy of pure love

1001
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,960
simply because of my humble background

1002
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,320
and the hardships I suffered in the past?

1003
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,200
Or, do you think

1004
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,320
that people like me

1005
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
only deserve to be pragmatic
and surrender to reality?

1006
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,240
I'm simply stating the facts.

1007
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,520
Neither choice is necessarily
better than the other.

1008
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,760
The problem is you.

1009
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,200
I've said it before

1010
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,160
that there's a contradiction inside you.

1011
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,040
There are actually
two characters inside you.

1012
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,200
They're both strong characters,

1013
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,080
but very different.

1014
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,440
The idealistic you

1015
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,000
was attracted by Xiao Chunsheng,

1016
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,200
and the fascinating love

1017
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,240
he represents.

1018
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,880
However, in life,
there are more things than love

1019
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,440
and sometimes you need bread more.

1020
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,400
So my brother appeared.

1021
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,760
He was the bread you need in an emergency

1022
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,600
and the realistic you was attracted by him.

1023
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,720
Now, both characters inside you
have been awakened.

1024
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,040
What will you choose, love or bread?

1025
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,440
In other words,

1026
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,800
no one knows who will win eventually,

1027
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,000
the idealistic you

1028
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,040
or the realistic you.

1029
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,480
Has anyone told you that
you sound patronizing?

1030
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,200
This isn't your life

1031
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,920
and has nothing to do with you at all.

1032
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,920
How can you be so judgmental?

1033
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,960
Do you really think you understand it
better than us involved?

1034
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,240
Because I'm his sister.

1035
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,560
I just want to make sure he won't be hurt.

1036
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,640
Being loved by me will hurt him?

1037
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,160
Being loved by you won't hurt him.

1038
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,000
However, I fear that you may choose him

1039
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,800
because you want the bread

1040
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,120
and a simpler and more practical future

1041
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,000
even though you don't love him.

1042
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,720
In this way, you will hurt not only him,

1043
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,680
but yourself as well.

1044
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,080
When you look back
while enjoying a comfortable life,

1045
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,400
you will only blame him

1046
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
for attracting the realistic you

1047
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,720
and therefore killing the idealistic you

1048
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,000
who longed for love.

1049
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,160
You will never be satisfied.

1050
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,440
I know the life I want

1051
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,320
and who I am

1052
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,520
very well.

1053
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,800
Please don't bother.

1054
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,560
Thank you for this money.
