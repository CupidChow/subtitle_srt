Wait.

Listen. Just this sound, you know?

45

Ghosts walk with this little sound.

It's no use hiding, you know?

Over here.

59
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,660
There. He's over there.

Come on, girl,

65
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,020
you'd better get to the rear.

66
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,180
Or he might have an accident.

67
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,940
Yeah.

68
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,940
Look, he's quite clumsy.

69
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,420
Come out!

70
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,340
Come out!

71
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,420
I don't believe you can hide forever.

72
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,740
I will catch you!

73
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,540
Where are you? Come out!

74
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,500

I didn't expect to find it here.

Who are you?

78
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,260
Why are you here? What's your job?

79
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
And how did you get in?

80
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,460
He...

81
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,140
Do you know what place this is?

82
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,380
You asked five questions

83
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,780
in one breath.

84
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,500
Which one shall I answer first?

85
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,620
Who am I?

86
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
A civilian.

87
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,220
One of the people.

88
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,540
What's my job?

89
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,700
I don't have a job.

90
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,060
What?

91
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,140
How did I get in?

92
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,580
Through the skylight.

93
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,940
The door is barred
and I had to take the skylight.

94
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,980
Why am I here?

95
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,020
I wouldn't be watching a movie here.

96
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,540
I...

97
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,060
I read books and study.

98
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,540
Do I know what place this is?

99
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,500
It's a stack room

100
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,460
where all confiscated
banned books are stored.

101
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,140
Extremely harmful.

102
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,260
If these books are taken out,
what would happen?

103
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,020
Horrible things, gentlemen.

104
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,780
You guys

105
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,740
must be either librarians
or security officers.

106
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,900
You know what?

107
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,100
I've been reading here
for over six months,

108
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,580
but you didn't notice me until today.

109
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,860
This is a terrible neglect of work.

110
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,060
You failed in your duty.

111
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,500
You not only betrayed

112
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,220
the great trust of our people,

113
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,540
but also remained irresponsible with me.

114
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,140
But don't worry.

115
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,020
I only harm myself with these books.

116
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,500
I've never taken out even a single one.

117
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,660
Well, that's easy enough to fix.

118
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,420
As long as you let it go,

119
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,140
this secret will be safe with me.

120
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,940
I promise.

121
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,940
After I get out,

122
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,580
I won't come back here ever again.

123
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,020
And unless I get in trouble,

124
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,900
you wouldn't have any trouble.

125
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,220
In this way,

126
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,380
no one else would be aware.

127
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,340
And of course,

128
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,380
you can turn me over
to the police station.

129

130

132
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,940
it's up to you to decide.

Yes, for a while.

If I held you guys up,

146
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,700
you would smash my stall.

Fine.

153

I'll then tell Chunsheng

Why hasn't he come yet?

157

He's with the Neighborhood Committee

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,900
you didn't repair his blades too much.

175
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,940
Comrades, listen.

176
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
When the ice rink opens,

177
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,180
we'll see.

178
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,300
Dandies and loafers of this city

179
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
will all come.

180
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,700
So,

181
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,940
stay alert today.

182
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,940
(Entrance and Exit)

183
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,740
Hi.

184
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,820
Where's Tian?

185
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,540
Oh, him.

186
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,020
He's snuggling up to a woman.

187
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,820
I heard a few days ago,

188
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,420
He Hongling tantalized another man

189
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,980
and Tian beat him up.

190
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,780
Is that true?

191
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,420
You know what?

192
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,540
In love affairs,

193
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,900
it always takes two.

194
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,660
Gorgeous!

195
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,180
- Hi, Xiaohui.
- Hi, Xiaohui.

196
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,700
Hi!

197
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,100
Go away. Go away.

198
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,620
Hi, Xiaohui!

199
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,700
Pretty girl!

200
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,980
Why did you pull me so hard?

201
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,380
My hand hurts.

202
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,660
Zhao Xiaohui, what are you doing?

203
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,060
What are you talking about?

204
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,420
What do you think?

205
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,140
Your pants nearly burst.

206
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,900
Don't you find them too tight?

207
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,700
I feel good, anyway.

208
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,100
The pants demonstrate my good shape.

209
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,540
What? You don't like them?

210
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,660
Come on.

211
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,860
I do like such pants.

212
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,020
But if you want to wear them,

213
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,820
do it at home for me.

214
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,180
Why do you wear them in public?

215
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,340
You would look like a bad girl.

216
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,500
Bad girl?

217
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,700
Heizi, don't be so ashamed.

218
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,940
Bad girl?

219
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm far from being bad yet.

220
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,020
And I decide if I'm like a bad girl.

221
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Do I look great?

222
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,540
Yes.

223
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,980
It's about time.

224
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,140
(Shichahai Ice Rink)
Why has no one arrived yet?

225
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,940
Yeah.

226
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,700
It's normal that Chunsheng is late.

227
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,860
But why hasn't Guohua come yet?

228
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
I'm curious, too.

229
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,860
(Bike Parking)

230
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,740
There he comes.

231
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,180
Guohua.

232
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,260
What happened to your face?

233
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
Who did it?

234
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,810
Who beat you?

235
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,570
Don't mention it.

236
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,620
I just fell off my bike.

237
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,500
How?

238
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,290
Don't ask.

239
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,090
Where's Chunsheng?

240
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,090
Hasn't come yet.

241
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
Hasn't come?

242
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,290
He's quite late.

243
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,900
Here. Your ice skates.

244
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,090
Chunsheng's ice skates.

245
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,020
Thanks.

246
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,020
How much?

247
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,380
It's OK.

248
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,260
Here.

249
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,540
No, it's OK.

250
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,620
You're not rich after all.

251
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,940
I can't have you pay the money.

252
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,860
Take it.

253
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,180
In the past six months,

254
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,700
I've been taking money
from you and Chunsheng.

255
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,420
My mother is sick

256
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,420
and my uncle asks for grain coupons.

257
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,260
Oh, come on.

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,580
We're best buddies.

259
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,300
Don't talk like an outsider.

260
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,180
Fine. I'll take it.

261
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,700
Come on.

262
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,060
Let's go ice skating.

263
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,380
I'll take a breath and catch up.

264
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,140
- Be quick.
- See you in a minute.

265
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,700
OK.

266
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,340
Go.

267
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,900

Heizi.

269
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,340
Go away. Go.

270
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,100
Hey, look.

271
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,860
I'm looking.

272
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,460
What are you looking at?

273
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Look over there.

274
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,820
Look.

275
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,940
He's obviously from a military compound.

276
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
How dare he skate here!

277
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,140
Right here in Shichahai.

278
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,020
He's got balls.

280

teach him a lesson.

281
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,260
- OK.
- OK.

282
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,100
There you go.

283
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,620
How dare you rip off my hat!

284
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Come on. Come on.

285
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,500
Catch.

286
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,500
Look.

287
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,500
Go.

288
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,380
Good. It looks new.

289
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,780
Hongjun, what happened?

290
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,300
He ripped off my hat.

291
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,620
Guohua, there are too many of them.

292
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,300
Wait. I'll go get helpers.

294

Sir.

295

Oh, Chunsheng.

296
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,660
Guohua put your ice skates here.

297
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,060
OK. Thank you.

298
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,740
You're welcome.

299
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,220
Chunsheng, you're just in time.

300
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,300
What happened to your face?

301
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
Nothing. Just fell off my bike.

302
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,220
Someone bullied Hongjun.

303
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,260
Give my hat back to me.

304
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,460
Be louder. Don't whisper.

305
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,340
Give my hat back to me.

306
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,980
It's your hat?

307

Fine. Call it.

308
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,020
If it replies, take it back.

309
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,020
Playing innocent, huh?

310
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,300
Who do you think you're scaring?

316

Here in public,
your man ripped off my friend's hat.

317
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Wasn't it too much?

318
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,940
Who's this guy

319
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,420
to meddle with my business?

320
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,700
Yeah.

Just listen.

326
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,540
Today is the first day of ice skating

327
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,700
and I don't want to be a spoilsport.

328
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,500
Give my friend's hat back to him

329
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,740
and this is over.

330

Listen.

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,620
I muddle along in this district.

Want a fight, huh?

337
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,380
Look how short they are.

338
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,460
Mind your attitude!

339
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,260
What?

340
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,940
The police.

You guys, break up!

Come on, let's go.

344
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,980
Young man,

345
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,060
this is a lucky day for you.

I usually stay around.

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,700
Come to me if you dare.

348
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,580
And if you don't, stay home!

349
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,660
You think I'm scared of you?

350
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
Let me tell you what.

351
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,580
I will get back my friend's hat.

352
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,300
Go!

353
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,260
Chunsheng,

354
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,860
do we just let them go?

355
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,340
Don't you see the policemen

356
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,580
and picketers everywhere?

357
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,900
If we had a fight,

358
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,380
we would all be arrested.

359
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,580
The day is still young.

360
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,780
He can't get away with this.

361
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,300
Let's bail.

362
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,340
Go.

363
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,980
Everyone, break up!

364
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Chunsheng, what do we do
about what happened today?

365
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,660
You don't need to ask.

366
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,860
Hongjun's hat was ripped off

367
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,180
and he got bullied like that.

368
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,980
If I don't make Guo Heizi

369
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,660
return the hat to Hongjun,

370
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,100
I won't even deserve my name.

371
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,900
But Chunsheng,

372
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,980
Heizi and his men are tough.

373
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,620
His boss Qi Tian

374
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,260
is really somebody in this city.

375
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,060
He is no pushover.

376
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,940
We may not stand a chance against him.

377
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,780
I don't care what he is,
a dandy or a loafer.

378
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,020
Whatever.

379
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,460
You know what?

380
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,740
Without the policemen

381
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,860
or the picketers,

382
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,140
I would have thrown those guys down.

383
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,780
For this,

384
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,660
we need a careful plan.

385
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,300
But rest assured, Hongjun.

386
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,700
I will avenge your humiliation.

387
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,820
In a couple of days,

388
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,420
let's go find Heizi in Shichahai.

389
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,260
Chunsheng, in my opinion,

390
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,180
that Shichahai Ice Rink

391
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,140
has been the territory
of dandies and loafers.

392
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,700
Military descendants like us

393
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,260
are usually bullied there.

394
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,900
Shichahai Ice Rink belongs
to everyone in Beijing.

395
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,780
However many
dandies or loafers there are,

396
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,220
I'm gonna screw them.

397
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,460
Awesome!

398
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,900
Chunsheng, we all listen to you.

399
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,500
We'll do whatever you tell us to.

400
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,420
Yes, Chunsheng.

401
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,420
Anyway, we'll take orders from you.

402
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,460
OK. Let's call it a day.

403
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,220
I'll summon you later.

404
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,460
Fine. We should go, then.

405
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,180
Go.

406
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,780
Bye, Chunsheng.

407
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,820
What about you?

408
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,420
It's not very late yet.

409
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,860
How about we go for some training?

410
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,180
Go.

411
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,700
OK.

412
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,500
I can't hold on.

413
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,740
Do some more.

414
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,740
No. I need a rest.

415
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,770
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

416
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,380
Chunsheng,

417
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,580
may I have dinner at your place?

418
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,340
I can't go home with the bruises.

419
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,140
You know my mother. She nags.

420
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,780
Tell me about it.

421
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,020
What happened?

422
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,620
I met my dream girl today.

423
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Had a daydream?

424
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm serious. I met her on Gulou Street.

425
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,420
She's gorgeous.

426
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,900
She even smiled at me.

427
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Fell in love at first sight?

428
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,220
Let me put it this way.

429
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,980
Just like how Pavel met Tonia.

430
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
The moment I saw her,
my heartbeat quickened.

431
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,660
Understand?

432
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,260
Come on.

433
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,260
Try more pull-ups.

434
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:32,900
A few more?

435
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,380
Hurry.

436
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:33,900
OK.

437
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,140
Why isn't he back yet?

438
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,540
Well done, Ye.

439
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
You're breaking your own record.

440
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,740
Oh, no. I really can't continue.

441
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,420
Oh, my God.

442
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,020
Let's take a rest.

443
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,980
Just a minute.

444
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,340
What's on your mind?

445
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,260
Nothing.

446
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,940
When I visited my father the other day,

447
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,860
I met Mr. Li from the Political Section.

448
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,500
We talked about my father's case.

449
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,500
What did he say?

450
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,540
My father's case

451
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,020
would not be handled very soon.

452
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,220
Would it?

453
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
Who knows how long it may drag on?

454
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,420
I don't want you to be held up.

455
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,580
What are you talking about?

456
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,460
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

457
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,660
Guohua,

458
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,740
go tell your mother

459
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
that you'll join the next conscription.

460
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,140
I won't.

461
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,420
I can't hold you up.

462
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,020
Don't you remember your childhood dream?

463
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,900
What did you say
when your father beat you?

464
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,700
I would be a general,

465
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,700
a commander, or a marshal.

466
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,860
Then do it.

467
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,500
Let alone your father,

468
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,340
even Ye Fang has been
in the army for a year.

469
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,540
As her brother, you still loaf at home.

470
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,460
I can't join the army now.

471
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,140
But you're not in the same case.

472
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,820
Stop.

473
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,100
We made a promise.

474
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,420
We would go to school, have fights,

475
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,460
join the army, and go to war together.

476
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,740
Whatever we do,

477
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,020
we must always stay together.

478
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,700
But that's our promise in childhood.

479
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,620
Does it not count now?

480
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,060
We'll always be best buddies.

481
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,580
Of course.

482
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,660
So,

483
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,260
listen to me.

484
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,060
All right. Let's go.

485
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,540
May I stay at your home tonight?

486
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,780
What do you think?

487
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,860
At least apply some ointment for me, OK?

488
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,460
Come on. Get in.

489
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,100
Sister, I'm back.

490
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,140
Hi, Yanqiu.

491
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,540
There you are, Guohua.

492
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,060
Your mother just called,
asking about you.

493
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,580
She did?

494
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,820
We get it, Yanqiu.

495
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,460
What amuses you?

496
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,860
See a doctor if necessary.

497
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,340
Or shall I take you to the hospital
for an X-ray?

498
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,380
Be gentle. Gentle.

499
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,700
You just don't understand.

500
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,860
Here, see?

501
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,420
My heart is hollowed out.

502
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,580
Indeed. And I haven't got it back yet.

503
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,780
I guess I can never get it back.

504
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,420
I don't even know that girl's name.

505
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,660
How can I find her?

506
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,220
Look at you.

507
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,660
Your birthday is in a couple of days.

508
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,860
I didn't know what gift I could prepare.

509
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,940
But now I know.

510
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,220
What is it?

511
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,860
I'll find her for you

512
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,500
and help you pursue her.

513
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,540
You will?

514
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Have I ever failed my promise?

515
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,980
No.

516
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,060
That's right.

517
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,300
What does that girl look like?

518
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Tell me about her.

519
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,180
Oval face.

520
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,460
Oval face.

521
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,140
Not this round.

522
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,020
Smaller. Smaller.

523
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,940
Fine.

524
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,260
Smaller.

525
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,340
How about this?

526
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,260
Yes, yes, almost.

527
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,420
She wore a wide-brimmed woolen hat.

528
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,220
A thin nose.

529
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,780
The nose is upturned.

530
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,740
A sharp nose.

531
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,420
Wait. Wait.

532
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,020
A sharp nose.

533
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,340
Like this?

534
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,180
Yes.

535
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,940
And then?

536
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,460
When she smiles,
she shows two shallow dimples.

537
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,620
Gorgeous.

538
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,020
Dimples.

539
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Her eyes

540
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,460
look as if she wanted to be angry

541
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,020
but she wasn't actually angry.

542
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,460
Wanted but wasn't actually angry.

543
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,420
Yeah. It's hard to describe that.

544
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,900
Fine. I get it.

545
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,100
Always beautiful.

546
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,580
What does it mean?

547
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,460
It means this girl

548
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,220
looks beautiful when she's happy.

549
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,220
And when she's angry, she looks better.

550
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,820
Yes, yes, that's it.

551
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,220
Kind of fun.

552
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,780
What do you think? Satisfied?

553
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,060
It's her.

554
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,980
It's just her, exactly!

555
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,780
Glad to hear that.

556
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,860
You know what?

557
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,980
After we put up

558
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,580
this sketch in Shichahai Ice Rink,

559
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,140
in less than three days,

560
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,500
we will know who she is.

561
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,020
Think about it.

562
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,540
All the young girls in this city

563
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,220
go to Shichahai Ice Rink.

564
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
We'll go to the ice rink?

565
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,660
Yes. Anyway, we'll go there for Heizi

566
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,340
and get Hongjun's hat back.

567
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,060
We'll also find her for you.

568
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,580
Have two things done in one place.

569
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,300
Put this up in the ice rink.

570
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,900
Will this work?

571
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,060
Let's just do it.

572
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,060
Maybe,

573
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,540
we'll have some dumb luck.

574
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,980
OK. I'll do anything you say.

575
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,340
Stop.

576
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,220
Mom, still awake?

577
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,180
I was waiting for you.

578
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,180
Come and sit.

579
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,500
Liu of the admission office told me

580
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,540
you got back the application I submitted.

581
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,620
I don't want to join the army now.

582
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,340
What happened to your face?

583
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,140
Nothing, Mom.

584
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,100
When I was riding my bike,

585
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,020
I accidentally fell off.

586
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,900
I'm fine.

587
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,940
This is hardly convincing.

588
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,580
You naughty boy.

589
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,340
It's not like you don't know

590
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,980
I, all alone, have been taking care

591
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
of you and your sister

592
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,180
in life and education.

593
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,820
Make a good showing, will you?

594
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,380
Mom,

595
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,860
thanks for your hard work.

596
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,220
You're just honey-lipped.

597
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,140
You know what?

598
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,340
Especially you.

599
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,220
If you don't succeed,

600
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,340
I'll be the one who people make fun of.

601
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,220
We're a military family.

602
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,820
Our members must join the army,

603
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,100
strive for the best
and serve our country.

604
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,940
But you keep putting it off.

605
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,820
Your sister has been
in the army for a year.

606
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,580
When will you join it?

607
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,020
You're her elder brother, but you...

608
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,660
Mom,

609
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,180
I understand your points.

610
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,660
But I can't leave Chunsheng alone.

611
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,260
I'm his best buddy.

612
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,900
If I don't wait for him, who else would?

613
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,060
You're a real man, huh?

614
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,820
Care about brotherhood, right?

615
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
I have no objection.

616
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,860
But your own future can't be disturbed.

617
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,580
You missed the recruitment twice.

618
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,940
You can wait for him.

619
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,180
However,

620
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,660
you have only six months.

621
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,060
Within six months,

622
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,300
if his father's problem
still fails to be solved,

623
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,820
you'll have to join the army.

624
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,580
I get it.

625
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,380
I get it.

626
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,220
Whose birthday is it
the day after tomorrow?

627
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,820
You don't want to celebrate it

628
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,980
with old guys like me, do you?

629
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,380
That'd be boring.

630
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,020
All right.

631
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,780
Your father will be occupied.

632
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,820
So will I.

633
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,820
Let's do this.

634
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,620
You celebrate it with your friends.

635
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,340
It's a deal.

636
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,620
You want more?

637
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,720
Rules for you, don't get drunk.

638
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,840
Don't make trouble.

639
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,780
Got it.

640
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,820
Thank you, Mom.

641
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,460
(Looking for This Girl)
Pretty girl,

642
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,820
who are you?

643
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,260
Since I lost you on Gulou Street,

644
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,300
I've been thinking of you.

645
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
(Shichahai Ice Rink)
At three tomorrow afternoon,

646
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,620
I'd meet you here.

647
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,580
A big reward for information.

648
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,820
Ye Guohua.

649
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,020
What? Nice trick, isn't it?

650
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,820
Not bad.

651
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,060
Don't worry.

652
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,060
You have me.

653
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,020
Chunsheng.

654
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,940
What have you got?

655
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,980
Did you see Heizi?

656
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,740
No.

657
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,020
They haven't come today.

658
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,260
Fine.

659
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,500
He's just lucky.

660
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,580
Let's come some other day.

661
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,580
OK.

662
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,980
Fang?

663
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,580
Having a holiday?

664
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,900
Yes. So, I'm back home.

665
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,740
Put Wang on the phone.

666
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Yes, it's me.

667
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,380
I just want to tell you

668
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,580
our meeting will have...

669
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,860
Mom, I'm back.

670
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,340
Not only our members

671
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,300
of the Municipal Women's Federation,

672
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,980
but also chairwomen
of grassroots Women's Federation,

673
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,420
some executive committee members,
and representatives from all walks of life.

674
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,020
As well as some related comrades
of the Municipal Party Committee and Corps.

675
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,580
So, the preparation work
must be done properly

676
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,180
and carefully.

677
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,700
Have everything implemented!

678
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,300
OK.

679
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,300
How about this?

680
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,540
At three tomorrow afternoon,
report to me in my office.

681
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,340
OK?

682
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,940
All right. All right.

683
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
To call Chen Tao?

684
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,980
Fang,

685
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,060
you're back?

686
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,420
Yes, Xiaomei.

687
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,540
Last time, you lent me

688
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,500
Cao Xueqin's A Dream of Red Mansions.

689
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,340
I finished reading it.

690
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,860
You told me about Jane Eyre,

691
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,650
Gone with the Wind,

692
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
and Wuthering Heights.

693
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,420
I found them for you.

694
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,300
You did? Great.

695
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,610
You always know what I want.

696
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,500
I'll bring them to you in a day or two.

697
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,460
By the way,

698
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,500
how's everything going
between you and Chen Tao?

699
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,460
Oh, don't mention it.

700
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,780
Just horrible.

701
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,300
I'll tell you about it when we meet.

702
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,180
OK.

703
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,260
I have something to tell you, too.

704
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,460
How about we go ice skating
in Shichahai this weekend?

705
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,420
Good idea.

706
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,940
Deal, then.

707
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,420
Was that Xiaomei,
Commander Tong's daughter?

708
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,980
Why don't you invite her over?

709
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,900
Since you were little,

710
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,220
you haven't got too many friends.

711
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,780
If you want more fun,

712
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,220
ask your brother to invite some friends

713
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,180
and you young guys can enjoy yourselves.

714
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,260
Mom,

715
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,180
don't have designs on her.

716
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,780
My brother isn't good enough for her.

717
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,740
Besides,

718
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,940
my sacrifice of marriage
for this family is quite enough.

719
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,820
What are you talking about?

720
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,180
Chen Tao is a good husband.

721
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,980
And you agreed to marry him.

722
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,340
Oh,

723
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,660
what's my brother been up to lately?

724
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,420
No idea.

725
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,820
The day before yesterday,
he had bruises on his face,

726
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,740
saying he fell off his bike.

727
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Who would believe that?

728
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,380
All right.

729
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,580
Do something when you're home.

730
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,900
Try to persuade your brother.

731
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,020
He doesn't listen to me now.

732
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,780
Persuade him

733
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,700
to join the army and leave.

734
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,420
He can't always lay around.

735
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,540
How are you getting along with Chen Tao?

736
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,980
As usual.

737
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,020
What else do you expect?

738
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
You're on holiday

739
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,100
and why isn't he back with you?

740
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,300
He's too busy to leave work.

741
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,060
Work comes first.

742
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,740
Isn't this your motto?

743
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,060
Come on.

744
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,620
Then why did you rush back?

745
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,340
You could have stayed with him

746
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,740
and taken care of him.

747
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,660
Mom,

748
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,660
today is my brother's birthday.

749
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,780
Those who don't know you

750
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,380
may think the fish is your real son.

751
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,460
She's jealous, huh?

752
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,420
(Qianhai Beiyan)

753
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,940
- Happy birthday!
- Cheers!

754
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,780
What did Chunsheng say that day?

755
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,460
I don't care who you are.

756
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,540
A duel or a group fight,

757
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,260
just name a place.

758
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,660
If the policemen hadn't come,

759
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,780
we would have thrown those guys down.

760
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,820
You must give them a lesson.

761
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,660
Right.

762
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,540
Hongjun,

763
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,940
I remember Fang loves

764
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Baked Assorted Meat with Cream Sauce.

765
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,700
Get some for her.

766
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,260
Come on, cheers.

767
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,300
You remember it wrong.

768
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,780
It has too much cream.

769
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,620
Terribly creamy.

770
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,380
Who pissed you off again?

771
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,700
Hongjun, put it there.

772
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,700
She loves that.

773
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,700
Fang,

774
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,980
I know you have a problem with me.

775
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,460
But today is your brother's birthday.

776
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,180
Give face to him.

777
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,540
It's been days since we last ate together.

778
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,620
So, I remembered that wrong.

779
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,580
I love creamy food, actually.

780
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,660
Come on,

781
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,380
don't you have table manners?

782
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,500
How could you take food
from someone else's plate?

783
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,260
We're laboring people

784
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,300
and I don't mind.

785
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,780
But I do.

786
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,980
Don't push it.

787
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,180
Fine.

788
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,500
Sorry, then.

789
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,900
You...

790
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,220
Fang,

791
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,380
if you feel bad about something, say it.

792
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,340
Or the grievances would kill you.

793
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,900
Then tell me.

794
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,420
How did my brother
get the bruises on his face?

795
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,740
Did he have a fight with you?

796
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,780
How many times have I told you?

797
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,020
I fell off my bike.

798
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,300
Why do you not believe me?

799
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,700
How could I believe you?

800
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,300
Over the years,

801
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,820
you've stayed with him, laying around.

802
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,300
Have you done anything serious?

803
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,260
And you.

804
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,620
You promised me

805
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,580
you wouldn't see him get hurt.

806
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,260
What do you say now?

807
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,620
Fine. Come on.

808
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,580
Here.

809
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,340
I failed to take care of him.

810
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,980
Let me apologize to you.

811
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,660
Chunsheng, don't indulge her.

812
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,820
Remember your promise.

813
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
My brother is dumb and slow-witted.

814
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,460
But he's really loyal to you.

815
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,980
Why hasn't he joined the army yet?

816
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
You know it better than me.

817
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,940
It's the last delay.

818
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,300
I promise you.

819
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,900
Times are about to change.

820
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,660
Without knowledge, you'll be eliminated.

821
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,660
If the college entrance examination
could be resumed,

822
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,290
without enough education,

823
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,020
how would you take it?

824
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,280
Am I right,

825
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,900
Hongjun?

826
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,540
No, no, no.

827
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,340
Hongjun.

828
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,180
Hongjun.

829
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,740
In my opinion,

830
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,820
when we went to school,

831
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,220
you were the best student.

832
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,460
Get prepared

833
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,580
and maybe you can be the top scorer.

834
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,380
Hongjun.

835
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,820
When you have time, learn from Fang.

836
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,660
I won't.

837
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,660
Why not?

838
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,660
You spoke ill of Chunsheng

839
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,660
and I don't like that.

840
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,380
I won't hurt you, anyway.

841
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,340
But if a man had said that,

842
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,540
I would have skinned him!

843
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,740
Right.

844
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,780
Come on, cheers.

845
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,180
How childish you are!

846
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,860
How about

847
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,300
we propose a toast to our birthday man?

848
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,340
Hope he'll manage to find his Tonia.

850
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,380
That's right.

851
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:06,860
Guohua.

852
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,740
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

853
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,860
(Be united for greater victories)

854
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,600
(Long live our great Party)
Here we go.

855
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,740
(Long live the great unity of the world)
Go ice skating.

856
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,700
(Train hard
Defend the motherland)

857
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,300
Guohua?

858
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,260
It's really unheard-of for you

859
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,380
to have come to the ice rink.

860
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,420
If you fall, don't snivel.

861
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,540
You're Tong Xiaomei, aren't you?

862
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,340
We live in the same compound.

863
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,220
But I remember

864
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,820
you never set eyes on us.

865
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,180
So, what brings you here, my lady?

866
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:16,940
Guohua,

867
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,140
don't make fun of my best friend.

868
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,260
Besides,

869
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,700
Xiaomei is a good girl.

870
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,460
She wouldn't fool around with you guys.

871
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,420
Who's this girl?

872
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
Why does she look so familiar?

873
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,940
She's Commander Tong's daughter

874
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,900
and younger than us.

875
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,020
Not one of our kind.

876
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,660
I met her several times in our compound

877
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,980
but never said hello.

878
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,260
She's a progressive young girl

879
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,140
and wouldn't play with laggards like us.

880
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,260
Nice to meet you.

881
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,460
I'm Xiao Chunsheng.

882
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,260
Nice to meet you.

883
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,740
I'm Tong Xiaomei.

884
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,260
We lived in the same compound

885
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,780
and met several times.

886
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,180
But we never greeted each other.

887
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,140
Today, we knew each other.

888
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,780
Nice meeting you,

889
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,900
Comrade Tong Xiaomei.

890
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,660
Enough.

891
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,060
Let go of her hand, or we'll charge.

892
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,900
Don't stand here.

893
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,700
Let's go ice skating.

894
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,980
Go.

895
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,420
That's a beautiful girl for you.

896
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,660
What are you talking about?

897
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,060
Mr. Qi,

898
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,220
there they come.
