3
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,420
(Closed in Three Days
Clearance Sale)

4
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,660
(Day and Night Shop)

5
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,560
I don't dare to get involved
in illegal operation.

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
It's all your money.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Take it back.

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,880
Go, go.

9
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,280
Hongjun,

10
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
I just heard

11
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
Qi Tian's shop was closed down.

12
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,520
What can he do, then?

13
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
He could have sold anything else.

14
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
But he sold smuggled tobacco.

15
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
Now in China, smuggled tobacco

16
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
is officially illegal.

17
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,080
His shop had to be closed down.

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,600
When Chunsheng knows it
after he comes back from Yunnan,

19
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,160
he'll be pissed off.

20
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,320
Qi Tian never likes
to take the right path.

21
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
It's just like a lesson for him.

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
Listen, you guys.

23
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
You have to behave yourselves.

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,840
Don't go illegal ways.

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
If you're in trouble,

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
I won't get you out.

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,080
What are you talking about, Hongjun?

28
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,200
We do small businesses
and we won't have trouble.

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,960
- Yeah.
- Right?

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
Come on.

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
- Come on.
- Cheers, Hongjun.

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Cheers.

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,800
But I don't think Qi Tian

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
will be defeated like this.

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Chunsheng is his brother-in-law.

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,440
When he's back, he'll help more or less.

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
He's faithful, after all.

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,000
Chunsheng is not only faithful

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,920
but also strong-willed.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
The most upstanding guys in the world.

41
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,160
Hongjun, don't think about him.

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's drink.

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,800
Yeah. Come on.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,400
Hongjun,

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,840
let's drink together.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:00,960
Cheers.

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,080
Bottoms up.

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Chunsheng just hasn't called for days

49
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,200
and look at her.

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,360
I think

51
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,280
we should

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,440
tie her to Chunsheng's belt.

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,960
Wherever he goes, he can take you.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,480
She's a grown-up

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,880
and we can't interfere.

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,960
It's not what you think it is.

57
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,040
What?

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,480
Did you miss me?

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,960
Chunsheng.

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,240
My parents are home.

61
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,800
I...

62
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm just back from Yunnan.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,760
And I brought some local food

64
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,120
to Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,040
I... I rushed over
after getting off the train.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,920
I didn't even go home.

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Why are you such a poseur?

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
Who am I doing this for?

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,680
Stop laughing.

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,080
Get me in.

71
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,040
Hurry. What are you waiting for?

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,840
Come on in.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

74
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
There you are, Chunsheng.

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm just back from Yunnan

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,920
and I brought you some local food.

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Look at him.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,960
He's good.

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Chunsheng,

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
do you have any plans?

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Dad.

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,240
See?

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Xiaomei

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
defends Chunsheng all the time

85
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,000
in case I talk harshly.

86
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,200
Yes, she does.

87
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,360
Let's eat.

88
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,760
Mr. Tong.

89
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
You're right.

90
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,880
Xiaomei cares really a lot about me.

91
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Thank you, Mrs. Tong.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Mr. Tong, I still decide
to start a business.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
I used to think

94
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
joining the army was the only way

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
to serve the people.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
But times have changed.

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,240
I had a trip to the South

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,400
and I've broadened my horizon.

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,400
The government also says

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
more power is needed
to develop the national economy.

101
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,320
Starting a business will be supported.

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,760
Sounds like you've made up your mind.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,960
In this case,

104
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
so much for the Anti-smuggling Squad.

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,360
Let's not bring it up again.

106
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240
We're getting old

107
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,800
and we can offer little help.

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
But

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,760
we sincerely hope

110
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,480
whatever industry you work in,

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
you'll try to be the best.

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,800
Mr. and Mrs. Tong,

113
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,840
don't worry.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,320
Now, I have no money.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
But I'm aggressive.

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,160
I'll work hard to achieve something

117
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
and make myself good enough for Xiaomei.

118
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Come on.

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
Drink with me.

120
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,960
Mr. Tong, a toast to you.

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Cheers.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,800
Cheers.

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Come on, Xiaomei.

124
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,280
Cheers, Mrs. Tong.

125
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,080
Come on.

126
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,000
Wake up.

127
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,080
Time for breakfast.

128
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm going to work.

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,030
Yanqiu.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,720
You're back?

131
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
Yes, for a couple of days.

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,240
Yanqiu, Xiaomei told me

133
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
about your shop.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,800
Yanqiu,

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,360
what's this?

136
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
My neighbor got a job
of paper-box making.

137
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm doing this for some little money.

138
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,120
What about Qi Tian?

139
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Sleeping.

140
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,880
Don't bully him!

141
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
Leave it to me.

142
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,040
Get up.

143
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,000
I said, get up! Do you hear?

144
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,960
Is this how you take care of my sister?

145
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,760
I've just been...

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,440
So, it's the reason

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
you sleep till noon?

148
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,480
It's the reason you make your wife

149
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
do paper-box making?

150
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,760
Qi Tian, listen.

151
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,320
My sister isn't a finicky woman.

152
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
But she's now your wife.

153
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
If you make her suffer and bully her,

154
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
I won't even care about our friendship.

155
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,600
Chief Xiong.

156
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
You're Jiefang's comrade-in-arms.

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
Then you're my comrade-in-arms.

158
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,840
Soldiers like us are a family.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
And don't get me wrong.

160
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
I invite you to dinner

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,320
just to make friendly contacts.

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I don't mean anything else.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
(Draft beer)
What are you talking about?

164
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,680
You know what, Chunsheng?

165
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You're from a compound. So am I.

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,720
You're from a military compound

167
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
and I'm from a foreign trade compound.

168
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,440
And you know what?

169
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Xiao Chunsheng's name

170
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,040
has got very popular among my buddies

171
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
in my compound.

172
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,720
Today, I can drink beer with Chunsheng.

173
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,960
And I'm really happy.

174
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,800
Come on.

175
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,720
Let's drink together, OK?

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Come on.

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Cheers.

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,840
Feels great.

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,520
Xiong, let me tell you this.

180
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
Chunsheng is my best buddy.

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,080
He invited you to dinner here

182
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,720
and it means he's taking you
as a friend, got it?

183
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,840
Comrades-in-arms and good friends.

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
Chunsheng, listen.

185
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
If you need help, tell him.

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,840
Don't hesitate.

187
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,120
Jiefang is right.

188
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,640
If you need anything, let me know.

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,000
Friends like us don't need
to be punctilious, OK?

190
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,040
Fine. I'll get to the point, then.

191
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
My friend in Kunming and I

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,680
want to do business in jade jewelry.

193
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
My friend is Xiang Nan.

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,280
He has his stores in Kunming

195
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,440
and a hand-me-down traditional workshop.

196
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Now, we have

197
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,960
a large stash of jade jewelry.

198
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,200
I wonder

199
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,680
if we can do this business

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,080
here in Beijing.

201
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,400
I get you.

202
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,720
So, you want to cooperate

203
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,560
with us, BACC Service.
[*Beijing Arts and Crafts Corporation]

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,920
Am I right?

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes, that's what I mean.

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,080
I'd like to know

207
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
if we can cooperate.

208
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,680
Yes.

209
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
Of course.

210
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Let me tell you this, Chunsheng.

211
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,920
BACC is

212
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,200
China's biggest company

213
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,720
in arts and crafts.

214
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,040
Jade jewelry also belongs

215
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
to arts and crafts.

216
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,440
And you know what?

217
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
The biggest jade processing plant in Beijing

218
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,640
is also affiliated to BACC.

219
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,440
Every year, we produce vast amounts

220
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
of jade jewelry and jade ornaments.

221
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
Some of them are sold overseas

222
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,920
to get export earnings for our country.

223
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
The rest of them

224
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,960
are sold in local BACC Services.

225
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
You're saying

226
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,680
you produce what you sell.

227
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,040
Then what about our jade jewelry?

228
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,200
Hear me out.

229
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
BACC Service

230
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,960
has points of sale

231
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,400
in some big foreign-related hotels.

232
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
A large supply is needed, then.

233
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
We not only produce our own jewels,

234
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,960
but also cooperate with many jewelers

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,280
on a commission basis.

236
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Do you understand?

237
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Yes.

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,280
How do you cooperate then?

239
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
We do this.

240
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,160
You give us your jewels

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,120
and we fix a price.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,160
Then,

243
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
based on this price,

244
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,840
BACC Service

245
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
will give a floating price.

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,200
After the jewels are sold,

247
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,520
we'll give you the money

248
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
according to the fixed price.

249
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,280
In this way,

250
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
you get profit.

251
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
So do we.

252
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,800
Got it?

253
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes.

254
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,480
How is the price fixed then?

255
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh, this.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
We have

257
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
hired some old experts

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,160
in jade jewelry

259
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
and craftsmen of jade carving.

260
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,360
They check the jewels and price them.

261
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,520
There's a Master Jin

262
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
whose ancestors

263
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,520
made jewels for the emperor

264
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,040
and Empress Dowager Cixi.

265
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,240
You know what?

266
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,720
Master Jin is in his sixties

267
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,280
and he retired.

268
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,520
But we especially

269
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,760
reemployed him.

270
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,880
He checks the jewels, prices them,

271
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
and meanwhile,

272
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,920
he teaches young craftsmen

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,400
to do some jade carving.

274
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
Master Jin is

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,320
a national treasure.

276
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
The real master.

277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,120
There's a saying in BACC Service

278
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,240
that an old master counts on nothing,

279
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,520
but his experience and skills.

280
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Don't worry, Chunsheng.

281
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,520
For all jewels you supply,

282
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,360
I'll have Master Jin
check them personally.

283
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,360
And the price will be good.

284
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,040
I won't make you lose money,

285
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,640
right?

286
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,280
Then I get nothing else to ask.

287
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,520
Let's do the business, OK?

288
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,640
OK!

289
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,440
Come on.

290
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,920
Chief Xiong, cheers.

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
- Drink like this.
- Cheers.

292
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes, Nan.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,560
Umm...

294
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760
That's what I talked about

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,080
with Chief Xiong of BACC.

296
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,440
What do you think?

297
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
That's great.

298
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,280
Chunsheng,

299
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,800
how about this?

300
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,080
Give me two days to prepare the jewels.

301
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
Then I'll fly to Beijing.

302
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,520
OK.

303
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll be waiting for you here.

304
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,920
See you in Beijing.

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,280
OK. See you in Beijing.

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
Xiaomei, Xiang Nan is

307
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,320
really a straightforward man.

308
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,880
And he's no-nonsense.

309
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,200
You've made up your mind?

310
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,800
Yes.

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,440
Chunsheng, you know what?

312
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
Over all these days,

313
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
you look the happiest now.

314
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm delighted, too.

315
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
Whatever decision you make,

316
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,560
I'll support you.

317
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,480
Roll up your sleeve.

318
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,920
OK.

319
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
Dad, Mom,

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,720
thank you for taking care of me lately.

321
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,400
I've almost recovered.

322
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,880
I want to go back
to the orchestra tomorrow.

323
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm about to tell you this.

324
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,240
We discussed it several times

325
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
and we think

326
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,480
Guohua is at this critical time
of his business.

327
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
In the past few months,

328
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,600
you tried so hard
just to be the concertmaster.

329
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,840
You and Guohua could seldom meet

330
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
in a month.

331
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,680
You can't live like that forever.

332
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
So, we think

333
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,040
you should quit your job

334
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,280
and focus more on family life.

335
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
Mom,

336
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,120
except playing the violin,

337
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,800
I never thought of doing anything else.

338
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
And I'm valued in my orchestra.

339
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
I know the condition of your orchestra.

340
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,600
There are very limited positions.

341
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,120
You've been resting for days.

342
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,960
And someone

343
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,560
has taken your place.

344
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
They have no reason

345
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,560
to wait for you.

346
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,350
Mom, are you saying

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,350
I've lost my position in the orchestra?

348
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll go ask my leader.

349
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't bother to go.

350
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,040
We visited him

351
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,960
and talked about it.

352
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
If you go ask him,

353
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,310
he'll be awkward.

354
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,040
You'll be embarrassed, too.

355
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,400
Mom, does the orchestra not want me back

356
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
or do you not want me to return?

357
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
Any difference?

358
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,720
Yes, of course.

359
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,280
Do know how hard it was

360
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,760
to work in a strange orchestra

361
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
after I left the army?

362
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,800
Do you know how hard I tried

363
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
to have come this far?

364
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,480
Look at the calluses

365
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
and wounds on my hands.

366
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,720
They witnessed my hard work and honor.

367
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm the concertmaster

368
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
and no one can replace me.

369
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
How could I not be wanted anymore?

370
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Fine.

371
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,280
I don't want you to return, OK?

372
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
I allowed Guohua to marry you.

373
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,680
You're Guohua's wife

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,480
and you should behave like it.

375
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,440
You two were young

376
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
and lived casually.

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Thinking you were still childish,

378
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,160
we didn't mind.

379
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,600
But now, you're old enough

380
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,960
to be parents.

381
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,240
You should be responsible.

382
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
If you hadn't worked that hard,

383
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,960
would you have an abortion?

384
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,480
Mom!

385
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,840
Am I wrong?

386
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,080
Don't interrupt.

387
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,440
Guohua is my single son.

388
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
I worked hard to bring him up

389
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
but you lost our grandson.

390
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Don't you feel sorry for us?

391
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,680
Don't you feel sorry for Guohua?

392
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,200
All right.

393
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Come on, don't stop me.

394
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,600
The more I say, the angrier I get.

395
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,760
Unless she gives us a grandson,

396
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,640
I won't change my mind.

397
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,920
Mom,

398
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,080
don't you know why I'm so competitive?

399
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,800
If your son hadn't urged

400
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
to leave the army,

401
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,560
I needn't have come
to a strange orchestra

402
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,440
or competed with some teenagers

403
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,960
from all over again.

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,720
You only care about your son.
Have you cared about me?

405
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,240
Have you considered my life or career?

406
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,360
Be right there. Who's that?

407
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,320
- Nan?
- Chunsheng.

408
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,920
- Come in, please.
- Upon receiving your call,

409
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
I prepared the jewels without delay.

410
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,920
In business, every second counts, right?

411
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
Come on, why didn't you tell me?

412
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,400
I could have
picked you up at the airport.

413
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,320
It's convenient to take a taxi.

414
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,840
And this is?

415
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,560
Nan, let me introduce her to you.

416
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
This is Xiaomei.

417
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,240
Oh, your girlfriend.

418
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
Nice to meet you.

419
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,520
I've heard a lot about you.

420
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,680
Seeing you reminds me of a poem.

421
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,400
The best girl

422
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
would be looking great like this.

423
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,360
No wonder when he was in Kunming,

424
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
he talked about you every day.

425
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,280
Nan,

426
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,320
Chunsheng told me a lot about you, too.

427
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
We're sort of old acquaintances.

428
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,080
Right, right.

429
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,040
Come on, be seated.

430
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,040
OK, OK.

431
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,200
Be gentle.

432
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,560
All jewels are in it.

433
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,520
Don't break any.

434
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
I know. You don't need to remind me.

435
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,760
Rest assured.

436
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,200
Be gentle.

437
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,840
Thank you.

438
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
So many?

439
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,480
Look.

440
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
This case

441
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,640
contains quality jewels
made of good material.

442
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,280
Don't bother to check this bag.

443
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
It contains medium and low jewels

444
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,080
for common people.

445
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,400
I think

446
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,720
when we do business,

447
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,240
we can't only sell quality jewels.

448
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,600
We need average goods, too.

449
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,600
Nan, it's so considerate of you.

450
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,280
Xiaomei, he's an expert.

451
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Look.

452
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,680
Quality jewels can be sold to foreigners

453
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,480
and rich buyers.

454
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,320
Medium and low jewels

455
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,680
can be sold to common people

456
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,320
who love jade jewelry.

457
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,640
In this way,

458
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,680
we can sell goods

459
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
at all levels.

460
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,600
Yes, that's right.

461
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Chunsheng, here are the jewels.

462
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,160
When can we contact BACC Service?

463
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Master Jin,

464
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,960
what do you think of these jewels?

465
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,000
Xiong,

466
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,320
if I see correctly,

467
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,680
these jewels

468
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
are made of two pieces of raw jade.

469
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,400
One from Nuna

470
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
and the other from Mowanji.

471
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,320
Am I right?

472
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,800
Master Jin,

473
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,680
you have sharp eyes.

474
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,760
Exactly.

475
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
The material is from these two places.

476
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,280
Two pieces of raw jade.

477
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,800
Master Jin,

478
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,160
how could you just see it and tell

479
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,000
where the material is from?

480
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
Chunsheng, you don't need to ask.

481
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,120
Master Jin is the best expert
of this industry.

482
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Whatever jade product it is,

483
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,600
he can look at it

484
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,960
and tell you where its material is from,

485
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
how many steps it took,

486
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
and how it was polished.

487
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,080
Discussing, drafting,
carving, and polishing.

488
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
He knows a lot about every procedure.

489
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,280
You're impressive, Master Jin.

490
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
Don't bother to flatter me.

491
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,360
You do this business

492
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,440
to make money, huh?

493
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
To be honest,

494
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
many people in Yunnan do jade business.

495
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,560
In the beginning,

496
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,520
I only wanted money.

497
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
But I think this industry

498
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,800
has a deep cultural heritage
and inheritance.

499
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
I no longer had the old idea.

500
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,440
Tell me what you think now.

501
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,800
Now, I think

502
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,400
I want more people

503
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,320
to know about China's jade culture

504
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,840
and make more people

505
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,200
love our jade products.

506
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,640
Because

507
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
they're gorgeous.

508
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,440
They deserve to be appreciated and owned

509
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,680
by more people.

510
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,360
What about you?

511
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,520
We think the same way,

512
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,600
so we work together.

513
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,280
Young guys,

514
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,240
remember what you said today.

515
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,960
All right.

516
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,840
Let me price them.

517
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,680
OK.

518
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,480
OK.

519
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,040
Come on, Nan.

520
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,800
- A toast to you.
- Let's drink.

521
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,800
Just drink a little.

522
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,360
I'll enjoy the food, then.

523
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Here. Taste the dishes she made.

524
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,800
OK, OK.

525
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,960
Thanks.

526
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,640
Nan,

527
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,400
you took two cases of products.

528
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,120
And BACC Service bought them all?

529
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,120
That's right.

530
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
Products of all levels,

531
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,800
BACC bought all of them.

532
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,680
Even in this case,

533
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,440
Xiong Jun said we offered too few things.

534
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,560
Still too few things?

535
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,240
Xiaomei,

536
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,600
don't be surprised.

537
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
Xiong Jun told me

538
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
BACC Service had

539
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,080
several points of sale in Beijing.

540
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
And some in foreign-related hotels.

541
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,800
Our products are

542
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
far from enough.

543
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,400
Also,

544
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Master Jin gave us a very good price.

545
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,640
On our products,

546
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,160
even a tiny flaw

547
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,200
couldn't escape Master Jin.

548
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,000
He's indeed a master.

549
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,480
Now,

550
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,240
I completely admire him.

551
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,520
That's right.

552
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,160
Not to mention Nan,

553
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,320
even I was dumbfounded.

554
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,680
Advantages and disadvantages
of every piece,

555
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,880
about transparency class, and cracks,

556
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,040
he talked quite a lot.

557
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,000
He also said

558
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,520
our products were carved terribly.

559
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,160
Men and women wear
different kinds of pendants.

560
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Face carving matters most.

561
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
But our products were so badly craved

562
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
that not even a single piece

563
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,400
could satisfy Master Jin.

564
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,800
You didn't see that, Xiaomei.

565
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,320
Nan was very unconvinced at first.

566
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,240
Then Xiong Jun took out

567
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
an Avalokitesvara statue
Master Jin carved.

568
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,960
When we saw that,

569
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,240
we were stunned.

570
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,520
That statue is as vivid

571
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
as if it were alive.

572
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,360
Nan stopped arguing immediately.

573
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,440
What else did I dare to argue?

574
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Master Jin did

575
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
the best carving.

576
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
The face of the statue,

577
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,640
the hands and the clothes patterns,

578
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,480
made me dazzled.

579
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,400
That pendant,

580
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,840
it can sell at any price.

581
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
Nan, don't only care about money.

582
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,000
That's a work of art.

583
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,240
And art is priceless.

584
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,680
Yes, yes.

585
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,040
You make me

586
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,360
so eager to look at it.

587
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,240
I wonder if I have the luck.

588
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,480
We've got to know Master Jin

589
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
and there'll be chances.

590
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,840
That's right.

591
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,600
Go with us next time, OK?

592
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
- OK. Let's go together.
- Come on.

593
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,440
Cheers.

594
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,120
Cheers.

595
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Come on.

596
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,120
By the way,

597
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,400
Chunsheng, Xiaomei,

598
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm going back to Yunnan tomorrow.

599
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
Nan, why not stay a few more days?

600
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,480
BACC bought

601
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,600
all the jade jewels I brought here.

602
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
I have nothing to do, then.

603
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,760
My plan is

604
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I go back to Yunnan

605
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,320
and buy some raw jade
from Tengchong and Ruili.

606
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,280
Then I'll have some products
made for BACC.

607
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,640
You made sense.

608
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,040
If BACC Service sells

609
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,640
the products we supplied,

610
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,680
they'll soon be sold out.

611
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
Fine, Nan.

612
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll count on you for the supply.

613
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,800
Count on me.

614
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,680
But... Umm...

615
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
I wonder

616
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,160
if I should say something.

617
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,000
Come on, we're friends.

618
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,800
Just tell me.

619
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,640
To be honest,

620
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,160
I spent most of my money

621
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
on the goods

622
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
sold in my stores in Kunming

623
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,240
and the products for BACC.

624
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,240
I'll have to give a large supply

625
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,520
to BACC again.

626
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,680
I'm... I'm a little bit short of money.

627
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Yeah.

628
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,320
It's quite a large supply.

629
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,560
How much money do you need?

630
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,560
Nan, you should have told me earlier.

631
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,520
How much more do you need?
I'll take care of it.

632
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,120
Fine.

633
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,120
Chunsheng, now that we cooperate,

634
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
I won't play hard to get.

635
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,480
Give me as much money as you can.

636
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,920
And I'll take care of the rest.

637
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,440
OK. Let's do this.

638
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,760
You return to Kunming tomorrow.

639
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll get as much money as I can

640
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,480
and then transfer it to you.

641
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
OK. It's a deal, then.

642
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,680
OK.

643
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,160
Come on.

644
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,760
Cheers.

645
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,600
You have to drink it up.

646
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,200
Nan is really fun.

647
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,160
Chunsheng, you promised
to get some money for him.

648
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,000
Have you thought about how to get it?

649
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,000
Nan was telling the truth.

650
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,480
We can't get money
from BACC very quickly.

651
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,680
Think about it.

652
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,800
If I didn't help him, who else would?

653
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,120
Then how will you help him?

654
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,320
I have some demobilization compensation

655
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,080
and some savings from my previous job.

656
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,520
Not a lot.

657
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,160
But it's better than nothing.

658
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,680
I have some savings.

659
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,400
I'll give them to you tomorrow.

660
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,200
Xiaomei, how could I take your money?

661
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,240
But we're a couple.

662
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,600
Don't bother about this.

663
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Well,

664
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,360
tomorrow, I'll visit my sister and Tian

665
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
and ask them to think of a way.

666
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,840
OK.

667
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,160
You call the shots.

668
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,160
But Chunsheng,

669
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,880
you have only a little money.

670
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,880
Even if you get some from others,

671
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,560
you can't afford a piece of raw material.

672
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,800
Nan must be aware of that.

673
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
But he asked you for money.

674
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,480
Isn't it weird?

675
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,960
I know him very well.

676
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,560
It's not weird.

677
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,720
He asked me for it

678
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
and I promised him.

679
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,680
Then I have to do my best.

680
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
Don't worry.

681
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,360
You're playing with jade jewelry?

682
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,040
What are you talking about?

683
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Tian, do you remember?

684
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,600
Back in Kunming,

685
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,360
I once saved a jade jeweler,

686
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,080
Xiang Nan.

687
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,720
Yes, I remember.

688
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,120
When I went to Kunming, he came to me,

689
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,120
asking me to get his business to Beijing.

690
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
I then asked a friend of mine

691
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680
to contact someone

692
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,040
from BACC.

693
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,440
The first batch of products
are being sold already.

694
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
Well done, Chunsheng.

695
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,000
Jade jewelry is a great business.

696
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,120
You must have earned a lot.

697
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
I was just helping him

698
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,000
and it's not my business.

699
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
Why is it not?

700
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,000
Without you,

701
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,920
he couldn't have sold
his jewels in Beijing.

702
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,160
All right, Tian.

703
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,400
Let's drop this topic.

704
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Today, I came to you

705
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,880
just because Xiang Nan invested too much

706
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
and he's short of money now.

707
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,880
I want to help him.

708
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,600
Go ahead.

709
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
We should help him.

710
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
Tell me, Chunsheng. How much?

711
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,720
Any amount.

712
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,400
You're quite boasting.

713
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Do you have money?

714
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,840
Then why does my sister
do paper-box making?

715
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,160
Tian, I didn't come

716
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
to borrow money.

717
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,280
I just think you have many friends
and you're respected.

718
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,920
Could you help me

719
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,760
to borrow some money
from your rich friends?

720
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,800
Don't worry.

721
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
When we get the money from BACC,

722
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,800
I'll return the money immediately.

723
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
Who do you want to borrow from?

724
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,280
Who?

725
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,400
When you need money,

726
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
just tell your sister and me.

727
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,040
You?

728
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
Chunsheng, don't underestimate us.

729
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
You know what?

730
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,760
I lost my shop, but I'm not broke.

731
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,840
I've been doing business
for so many years.

732
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,160
And I have some savings.

733
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,480
Don't boast, Tian.

734
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,640
You have savings?

735
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
Then why does my sister
do paper-box making?

736
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,640
You have to ask her.

737
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
I quarreled with her
over this several times.

738
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,520
I said we had savings

739
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,680
and she didn't need to do that work.

740
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,680
Do you know what she said?

741
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,080
"Using the savings
will be depleting our resources

742
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,320
and then the money will be gone."

743
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,800
She doesn't allow me to use the savings.

744
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Well, she's right.

745
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,400
We need money for emergencies.

746
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,320
Right?

747
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,480
You know what?

748
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,280
It's the way my sister is.

749
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,840
She's hard-working.

750
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,280
Right. She loves to work hard.

751
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,200
But luckily, she keeps the money.

752
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,480
Otherwise, I would have used it up.

753
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,160
See?

754
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
Now, it's needed.

755
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,760
Well, Tian,

756
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
discuss it with my sister tonight.

757
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,720
If she approves,

758
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,280
give the money to me.

759
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,800
Don't worry.

760
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
I know Xiang Nan very well.

761
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,120
He won't borrow the money for nothing.

762
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
Just tell my sister this.

763
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,360
Tell her lending the money to us

764
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,400
will get a higher interest rate
than saving it in the bank.

765
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
What are you talking about?

766
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,200
Chunsheng,

767
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,080
since my shop was closed down,

768
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,040
I've been thinking

769
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,720
what else I can do.

770
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
See? It's a golden chance for me.

771
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,640
Jade jewelry. What a great business!

772
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,120
Mr. Xiang is experienced.

773
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
And you have the distribution channel.

774
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,360
We can make money
as easily as we can imagine.

775
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,800
Chunsheng,

776
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,840
how about you discuss it with Mr. Xiang?

777
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,480
Take my money for shareholding

778
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,560
and we can do business together.

779
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,320
What do you say?

780
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,520
Tian, nice try.

781
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,800
Share?

782
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,230
Let me tell you something.

783
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,320
Xiang Nan indeed asked me

784
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,190
to be his business partner.

785
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
But I didn't accept it.

786
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,520
For BACC, I just did him a favor.

787
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,190
And,

788
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,560
we only have this little money.

789
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,080
I'm too ashamed to ask for shareholding.

790
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,920
Chunsheng, this is your problem.

791
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,800
You stand too much in pride.

792
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,000
I know you don't want
to take advantage of him.

793
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,710
I won't push you.

794
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,710
Tonight, I'll discuss it with your sister.

795
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,630
If she approves,

796
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,800
I'll give you the money tomorrow.

797
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,800
And whether I lend it to you

798
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,710
or I give it for shareholding,

799
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,400
I'll listen to you.

800
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,480
You call the shots.

801
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
OK.

802
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,400
I received the money transfer.

803
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,780
(Remittance Notice of China Post)

804
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,760
You've really offered timely help.

805
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,320
Nan, don't tease me.

806
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,680
This little money I give you

807
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,320
can't help you a lot.

808
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,120
The amount doesn't matter.

809
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,480
Our friendship matters.

810
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Nan, I'm calling you

811
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,800
to tell you something.

812
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,800
Chief Xiong from BACC told me

813
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,480
your products sold very well

814
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,600
and he asked you to deliver some more.

815
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,960
The products are ready.

816
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,120
I'm going to Beijing tomorrow.

817
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,560
But Nan, I just transferred the money
a couple of days ago.

818
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,920
And the products are ready?

819
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,560
Don't bother about it.

820
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,760
Wait for me in Beijing.

821
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,960
OK. I'll be waiting.

822
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,280
This one is the best.

823
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,720
30,000 yuan.

824
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,840
What did I say?

825
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,040
Master Jin will give you a high price.

826
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
5,000 yuan.

827
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,560
This one is indeed poorly carved.

828
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,440
But the material is good.

829
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,920
Right.

830
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,560
It's good.

831
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,880
This one looks better.

832
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,800
25,000 yuan.

833
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,920
This one... Better than that one.

834
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
Here. Check this.

835
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,200
Money for the products.

836
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,260
(Commercial Acceptance Bill)

837
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,240
Thank you, thank you.

838
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,640
You're welcome.

839
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Thank you so much.

840
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,600
Not at all.

841
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,400
Come on, let's drink.

842
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,560
Cheers.

843
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,720
Come on.

844
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Cheers, Tian.

845
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,600
Qi Tian isn't an outsider.

846
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,920
We're a family, then.

847
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,240
In my toughest time,

848
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,440
you helped me.

849
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,880
I wouldn't say thank you.

850
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,120
Nan, returning the money so soon?

851
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,000
Not returning the money,

852
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,640
but giving you the dividends.

853
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,640
This is too much.

854
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,560
But...

855
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Nan, what do you mean?

856
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
It's half of the profit

857
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,240
from our first batch
of products to BACC.

858
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,120
You deserve the money.

859
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,320
I can't accept this. Take it back.

860
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,360
I knew you wouldn't accept it.

861
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,840
Chunsheng, back in Kunming,

862
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,320
I asked you to be my partner.

863
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,240
You haven't accepted my offer.

864
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
But you got me access

865
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
to BACC, didn't you?

866
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,120
It was nothing. Don't mention it.

867
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
To you, it was a little favor.

868
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,480
But to me, it was really hard.

869
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,760
This is your value.

870
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,480
And,

871
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,640
let me tell you the truth.

872
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,800
I know

873
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,840
if I only asked you

874
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,120
to contact BACC,

875
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,480
you wouldn't accept any money.

876
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
Then, I lied that I needed money

877
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
and asked you for some.

878
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,760
I got your money, anyway.

879
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
But to me,

880
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
I didn't borrow it.

881
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
It's your money for shareholding.

882
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,440
So,

883
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,360
since the moment you helped me,

884
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,600
you've been my partner.

885
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,120
You deserve the dividends.

886
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,520
Even if I gave some money and helped,

887
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,640
the jade jewel industry must be

888
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
a huge investment.

889
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Our money

890
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
could only be a fraction.

891
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,080
I can't take

892
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,000
half of the profit.

893
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,120
As an old saying goes,

894
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,880
it's easy to do business,
but it's hard to find a good partner.

895
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
It's great luck

896
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,920
for me to find you,

897
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,800
such a good partner.

898
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,240
Besides,

899
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,320
money can't measure everything.

900
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,120
And your value can be

901
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,600
far more

902
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,080
than half of the profit.

903
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,720
Nan, I know.

904
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,520
You want to thank me

905
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,680
and help me.

906
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,560
I appreciate it.

907
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,600
But I really can't...

908
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,720
No buts.

909
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,240
It's a deal.

910
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
You'll be my partner in Beijing.

911
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,600
For the profit here, we go fifty-fifty.

912
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,520
If you still play hard

913
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,920
and reject me all the time,

914
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,720
I will...

915
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,080
I will get back all my products

916
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,280
from BACC and go back to Yunnan.

917
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,680
I...

918
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,320
I'll pretend I didn't have this friend.

919
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,120
Nan, you're pushing me.

920
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,760
Come on.

921
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,000
You're pushing me, OK?

922
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,680
Over all these years,

923
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,800
this is the happiest thing I've done.

924
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,840
Let me do this, OK?

925
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,120
Fine.

926
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Nan, I won't nag.

927
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,600
From this day on, we're a family

928
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,400
and business partners in Beijing.

929
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,920
Good, Chunsheng.

930
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,840
This is the day I've been expecting.

931
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,840
Come on, Tian.

932
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,160
Cheers.

933
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,520
Wish you great wealth

934
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,520
and a blooming business!

935
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,200
To a blooming business.

936
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,080
- Cheers.
- To great wealth.

937
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,880
Harder. Harder.

938
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,680
Do it harder.

939
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,320
Still harder.

940
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,480
There you are, Chunsheng.

941
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,240
Mr. Chen, Mr. Li.

942
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,840
Practice walking?

943
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,640
Come on, Chunsheng.

944
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,160
Did you forget us?

945
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,960
How would I?

946
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,800
I've been thinking of you guys

947
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,920
and I missed you.

948
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,480
Chunsheng, did you see Xiaomei?

949
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,720
She's giving an injection
in the compartment.

950
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,440
Mr. Li, I didn't come for Xiaomei.

951
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,680
I came for you guys.

952
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
We haven't seen you for days.

953
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Without you, this center was boring.

954
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,400
You missed me, huh?

955
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,760
How about I also get a certificate

956
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,240
and then work here?

957
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,000
Good idea.

958
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,800
Forget it.

959
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,080
This center is too small

960
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,680
for a great man like you.

961
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,200
Don't tease me.

962
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,520
How's everything going here?

963
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,480
Many familiar people are gone.

964
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,960
Did they go home after the recovery?

965
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,400
That's impossible.

966
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
Now, I get it.

967
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,680
Rehabilitation is

968
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
a very long process.

969
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,280
We have to be confident,

970
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
patient,

971
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,400
and persistent.

972
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,840
Every day, we have to exercise.

973
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,520
It's not that living here for some days

974
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,960
can get us to recover.

975
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,640
And Chunsheng, you know what?

976
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,480
This rehab center

977
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,960
is really good.

978
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,480
But the instruments

979
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,720
are in short supply.

980
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,760
Look at this. Yes, that.

981
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,160
Since it cured you,

982
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,960
it has been left to us.

983
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,520
Everyone in this center

984
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,480
took turns to use it.

985
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,280
But it wasn't long

986
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
before it was broken

987
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,240
without permission!

988
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,960
Indeed.

989
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,160
Think about it.

990
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,160
If there had been some spare sets,

991
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,560
it wouldn't have been broken.

992
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,040
Broken?

993
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,520
The rehabilitation must be held up.

994
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,600
How many people do you think

995
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,200
can be as lucky as you

996
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,640
to have Tong Xiaomei?

997
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,720
She patiently gave you massages

998
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
and acupuncture.

999
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,240
And guess what?

1000
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,560
Most family members of the patients

1001
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,800
know nothing about rehabilitation.
