=Episode 11=

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,640
Comrade Ye Guohua is an ordinary soldier,

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
so the result is obvious.

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,920
But apart from
these external conditions,

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,960
as a soldier,

7
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,200
in terms of training results,
Guohua ranks first in his recruit class.

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,600
And Guohua treats his comrades-in-arms
with sincerity and enthusiasm.

9
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,960
Everyone likes him.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,520
Besides, Guohua is frank and upright.

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
What about you?

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
You are nothing compared to him.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,440
Most of all, I dislike you.

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,240
I dislike your hypocrisy

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
and your stupid arrogance.

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
In this respect, you will never win.

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Well said!

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,840
Bravo!

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,320
Yeah!

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,920
Well said!

21
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,640
What a speech!

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,070
Hongling, well said!

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Hongling!

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bravo!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,160
Hongling, you are right.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
Well said, Hongling.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
I admire you, Hongling.

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,280
- Hongling!
- Bravo!

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
Hongling, you are awesome!

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,480
What a speech!

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,340
(Unit One)

32
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,440
Yanqiu! Yanqiu!

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Dad!

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,880
- What's up?
- Yanqiu!

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,040
Good news!

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,320
What good news?

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,640
I can join the army now!

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Really?

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
Guess where I'm going.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,040
Just tell me!

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm going

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
to where Guohua is at.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,840
This is great!

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
You guys will be together again!

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,640
That calls for a celebration!

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Tell Xiaomei to come.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
Let's celebrate!

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
OK!

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,840
Silly boy.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,780
(Unit One)

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Eat some more.

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,360
After enlisting,

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
you won't be able to
have the dishes I cooked.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Dad, eat this.

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,320
This is the best.

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
I don't care about them.

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
You take this.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,560
Xiaomei, today is special.

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Just let my dad have a drink.

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Not even a single drop.

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
Xiaomei has the final say on this.

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,160
Come on, I'll fill your cups up.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,360
Yanqiu.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,840
This is yours.

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Dad,

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
I can finally join the army.

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
That's good.

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Tell me why you want to be a soldier.

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Sir,

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
I want to serve the people!

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,360
Good, you remind me of myself
when I was young.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
I promise I won't let you down.

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,560
Young comrade, go for it!

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
But remember,

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,360
now that you put on this uniform,

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
you can never take it off!

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,120
Dad.

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
You have a great responsibility,

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,400
because behind you is our motherland!

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,720
My son

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,120
should have been a soldier, too.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,160
But he couldn't, because of me.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Dad.

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Mr. Xiao, sit down.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Dad,

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
it's not your fault.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
If it weren't for you,

89
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
I wouldn't want to be a soldier.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao,

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
your son is better than him.

92
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,200
Really?

93
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
If my daughter-in-law says so,
it must be true.

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,000
Mr. Xiao.

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
That is not me.

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
You got the wrong person.

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,360
How is that possible?

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
Wasn't it you
who came to visit me yesterday?

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Wasn't it you last week?

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
You remember this very clearly.

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
Of course.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
I may not remember anything else,

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
but how can I not remember
my son and daughter-in-law?

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
How long can I stay with my son?

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Good.

106
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,480
Very good.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Now Chunsheng has you.

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
As long as Yanqiu finds a good husband,

109
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll proudly face their mother in heaven.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,640
Dad.

111
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Dad.

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
This is such a happy occasion,

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,440
why did you say that?

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
What happy occasion?

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,640
Whose birthday is it?

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,960
Mr. Xiao, eat well

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
and you'll live long.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Today, there is your favorite dish.

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,600
Braised pork.

120
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,320
Is it good?

121
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Chunsheng, I am so happy for you.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Xiaomei, pinch me.

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,120
Come on, pinch me.

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Harder.

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,920
This is real.

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
Xiaomei, I'm so happy

127
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
that I feel like I'm dreaming!

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,760
Let the dream continue then.

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,120
Xiaomei,

130
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,600
thank you for taking care of my dad
during this time.

131
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
His case is cleared now.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
And his follow-up treatment

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,440
will be taken care of
by the Organization.

134
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,640
I hope you can spend more time

135
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
on study.

136
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
It's not a drag for me.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,120
Mr. Xiao is a good person.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
And I like Yanqiu very much.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,280
Please don't get me wrong.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840
I just think,

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
it's only a few months
before the college entrance examination.

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
This is the dream
you have been chasing for so long.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
I hope you can study hard

144
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
and get ready for it.

145
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
After you are admitted to a university,

146
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,560
you can make some like-minded friends.

147
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Do you remember

148
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,480
those interesting things
Fang told us about their university?

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,720
I think

150
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,840
you are that kind of person.

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,640
Well,

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,400
I mean

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,120
I think you should join them.

154
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,120
You belong to their world.

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Bah.

156
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
What am I talking about?

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean

158
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,920
they are your true friends on your way

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,760
to realizing your dreams.

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
You should stand with them,

161
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,840
and have a vigorous youth.

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,800
Chunsheng.

163
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,320
You are also my friend
on the way to realizing my ideal.

164
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,160
You have reached the starting point
of realizing your dream.

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,800
I should also start to

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
work hard to reach that starting point.

167
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,480
Believe me.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
I can definitely be a doctor.

169
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
We are still friends, right?

170
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,400
Of course.

171
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,760
Chunsheng, I was sick some time ago,

172
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,760
and also encountered
some problems in life.

173
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,960
But don't worry, they were all solved.

174
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm looking forward to
meeting you at the barracks.

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,600
I'll wait for you.

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,360
Tian!

177
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,640
You improved a lot.

178
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Wait.

179
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,600
Aren't you supposed to
come out half a year later?

180
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,080
I thought I couldn't see you

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
before I leave.

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,960
I did something meritorious in there,

183
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
so they released me early.

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,400
Why didn't you come to me?

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,920
I...

186
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
I didn't want to affect you.

187
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
So I... You understand?

188
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,280
What are you saying?

189
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,320
You, Qi Tian,

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,680
will always be my big brother.

191
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm glad to hear that.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,560
Tian,

193
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
there's a favor

194
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
I was going to ask Dong.

195
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,240
Since you are out,

196
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I'll ask you this favor.

197
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
What's the matter?

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,280
My sister is stubborn and upright,

199
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,480
and my dad needs to be taken care of.

200
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm afraid she can't handle it alone.

201
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,840
Rest assured.

202
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,800
Consider it done.

203
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
With me around, no one dares to

204
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,120
do anything to your sister.

205
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,040
OK, thank you, Tian.

206
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,960
We are brothers.

207
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,320
Are you guys done?

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
You two had a good chat, huh?

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
Well,

210
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,240
since you are here,

211
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,360
why don't you join them?

212
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
Dong, I can't.

213
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,840
I just came

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,760
to say goodbye.

215
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,560
My train is leaving.

216
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
I have to go now.

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,760
All right.

218
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Chunsheng,

219
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
good for you.

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,920
This is a good chance.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
You must cherish it.

222
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,480
Don't worry.

223
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
I promise I won't let you down.

224
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,060
(Beijing Railway Station)

225
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
You have to behave.

226
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,800
Don't fight with others, OK?

227
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,960
I got it, Yanqiu.

228
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
Take care of yourself, do you hear me?

229
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,760
Don't worry about Dad, I'm with him.

230
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,040
Just take care of yourself.

231
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Do you hear me?

232
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,960
OK, Yanqiu.

233
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,160
Don't worry. I got it.

234
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
Come on.

235
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,440
The train is leaving.

236
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Fang, what's wrong with you?

237
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
Why are you so callous?

238
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
I am just being calm.

239
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
Do you know why
I am worried least about Hongjun?

240
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,640
Why?

241
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
Because of you.

242
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,280
Heizi,

243
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,960
don't make it hard
for Hongjun again after I leave.

244
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,720
You are both my brothers.

245
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,320
I am not interested

246
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,440
in that coward.

247
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
Now you are a soldier,

248
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
and he is a so-called intellectual.

249
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,080
We are all on different paths.

250
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,160
I am still looking for a way
to make a living.

251
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
I have no time to waste on him.

252
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,760
Talk properly.

253
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't worry, Chunsheng.

254
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,560
OK.

255
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,760
Hongjun.

256
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,480
Chunsheng.

257
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Write to me.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,040
Whenever you can't
make a decision about something,

259
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,480
discuss with Fang.

260
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,840
Chunsheng.

261
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,640
I got it.

262
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,240
You two,

263
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,600
don't be lax.

264
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,840
When you pass the political appraisal,

265
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll see you at the barracks.

266
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,480
I'll take care of our family.

267
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,760
Don't worry.

268
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
Time to board the train!
Board the train!

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,320
Don't worry about us.

270
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,320
Come on. Board the train.

271
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,760
Chunsheng.

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
- I'll definitely write to you.
- Board the train.

273
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,320
All right. Take care.

274
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,760
I have to go.

275
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,360
Take care.

276
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Take care, Chunsheng.

277
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,930
Goodbye.

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,320
Take good care of yourself.

279
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,720
That's it. Just go.

280
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,520
Goodbye, Yanqiu.

281
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,640
Go. Just go.

282
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
Go now.

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,360
Bye.

284
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,120
Left-right-left!

285
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,080
About face!

286
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,920
Left-right-left!

287
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
Left-right-left!

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,400
You are fast!

289
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,920
Left-right-left!

290
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,080
Starting exercise! One!

291
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,600
Change!

292
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,320
Two!

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,680
No. 2,

294
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,840
move your arm down a little bit.

295
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,280
Right.

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Dress right!

297
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Parade step, march!

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,720
Everyone!

299
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,600
Ready!

300
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,080
Run!

301
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
Not bad.

302
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
My name is Xiao Chunsheng.

303
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,240
And you?

304
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,960
You are arrogant.

305
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
The first place, Duan Lei.

306
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
Second, Xiao Chunsheng.

307
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
Third, Meng Jinzhu.

308
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,520
Fourth, Wang Hui.

309
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,320
Fifth, Su Hua.

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,740
(Unity & Tension
Seriousness & Liveliness)

311
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,600
Qian Amao,

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,400
can you wash your socks?

313
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
They are making me choke.

314
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Can't you

315
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
pay attention to personal hygiene?

316
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,800
Are you blind?

317
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,150
Say that again!

318
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,080
Dust off your shirt outside!

319
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,320
Are you being a bully?

320
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
I despise people like you the most!

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,240
Let's see if you are

322
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,400
qualified to get past me!

323
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,120
Wait a minute!

324
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,080
Let go!

325
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,080
Let go!

326
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
Come on!

327
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,040
We are all new recruits,

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,120
don't make it hard for each other.

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,560
Qian Amao,

330
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
he was right.

331
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,240
Your socks really stink.

332
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,960
Not only Meng Jinzhu,

333
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
we all can't stand it

334
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
in our dormitory.

335
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
And it's affecting the image
of us soldiers.

336
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
You should wash them now.

337
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Duan Lei, right?

338
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Meng Jinzhu did that
for collective honor.

339
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
In a few days, there will be
military bearing and discipline appraisal.

340
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,080
Listen, guys,

341
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,360
save your energy for the training ground.

342
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,560
I despise you bunch of laggards.

343
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,920
So what if
your personal performance is good?

344
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,280
Your bad military discipline
will harm the whole team.

345
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
Neither of us will make it
to the elite squad.

346
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,800
What elite squad?

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,480
I will get rid of you sooner or later!

348
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
Ready!

349
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,000
Go!

350
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Beat him!

351
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,800
Chunsheng, get up!

352
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
Take him down!

353
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,320
Bravo!

354
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,120
That does not count!

355
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,600
Duan Lei,

356
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
do you dare to
compete with me on the bars?

357
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,560
No problem.

358
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,080
Xiao Chunsheng, listen,

359
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm better than you at everything.

360
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
Stop bragging!

361
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Let's go!

362
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
Sir!

363
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,760
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng

364
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,120
wants another competition.

365
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,120
Please advise!

366
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,840
Approved.

367
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
All rise!

368
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,520
Xiao Chunsheng, Duan Lei, fall in.

369
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
About face!

370
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,760
Everyone!

371
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,360
Left face!

372
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,560
Forward, march.

373
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,480
The regimental commander

374
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,160
specially approved your transfer.

375
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,240
Do you know why?

376
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Of course I know.

377
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,840
I was in your recruit company

378
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
when I joined the army.

379
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,840
I'm familiar with the management

380
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
and training of recruit companies.

381
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Most importantly,

382
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,440
I am your most helpful soldier.

383
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,440
And I can fully implement

384
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,240
your requirements on new recruits.

385
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,360
You are so smart.

386
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,440
No wonder you got promoted
to a platoon leader.

387
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,520
Company Commander,

388
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
this is all because of my hard work.

389
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
I believe you are a good soldier,

390
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,160
and you will also be
a good officer in the future.

391
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Thank you, Company Commander.

392
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
Halt!

393
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
Right face!

394
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,040
Squad Leader Zhao!

395
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,520
Sir!

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,360
Chunsheng,

397
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,560
just like you,

398
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,840
I don't like Duan Lei.

399
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
You must not lose to him!

400
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
Chunsheng, I thought you were good.

401
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,240
How could you be knocked down

402
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
on the ground by Duan Lei?

403
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,160
What do you know?

404
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,200
Bayonet fighting is not my strong point.

405
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,320
Really?

406
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,960
I heard that

407
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
you were the street king

408
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,520
back then.

409
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,800
You should be good at fighting.

410
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,480
We fought with bricks

411
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,360
and spring locks.

412
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,400
Who would use a bayonet?

413
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,000
Let me introduce you.

414
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,520
This is your new platoon leader,

415
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
Comrade Ye Guohua.

416
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
Nice to meet you, sir!

417
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,160
Nice to meet you.

418
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,560
Rest assured, guys.

419
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,960
Since I was young,

420
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,400
I practiced on bars with soldiers
from the guard company.

421
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,920
This is my strong point.

422
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
We are counting on you then.

423
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,760
The purpose of this tactical assessment
of the new recruits

424
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,160
is to examine their physical fitness

425
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,080
and to conduct a survey

426
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,160
for the next stage of training.

427
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,160
Go on.

428
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,880
Yes!

429
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,080
Xiao Chunsheng!

430
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,640
Sir!

431
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,560
Step forward.

432
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,360
Horizontal bar exercise one!

433
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,520
Pull-ups!

434
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,880
Start!

435
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,480
Yes!

436
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,640
Three.

437
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,680
Four.

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,720
Five.

439
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Six.

440
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,400
Seven.

441
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,720
Eight.

442
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,240
Not bad, Guohua, you broke the record!

443
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,080
What's going on?

444
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,840
Did a fairy stimulate you?

445
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm done.

446
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm done.

447
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,760
That's it.

448
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,360
68.

449
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
69.

450
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,920
70!

451
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
Great!

452
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,440
Bravo!

453
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,880
Sir!

454
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Horizontal bar exercise one,

455
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,800
complete.

456
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Fall in.

457
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,120
Duan Lei!

458
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,720
Sir!

459
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,560
Step forward.

460
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,040
Horizontal bar exercise one! Pull-ups!

461
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,920
Start!

462
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,560
Yes, sir!

463
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,720
One, two.

464
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,760
Three, four.

465
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,800
Five, six.

466
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,480
Seven, eight.

467
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
105.

468
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,760
106.

469
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,040
107.

470
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
108.

471
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,680
Bravo!

472
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Great!

473
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,680
Sir!

474
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,280
Horizontal bar exercise one,

475
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,120
complete.

476
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,720
Fall in.

477
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,280
Yes, sir!

478
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,920
108?

479
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,560
He's not human. He's an animal!

480
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,440
What do you think, Xiao Chunsheng?

481
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Do you admit defeat?

482
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,280
What?

483
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
I have never been defeated

484
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,200
since I was little.

485
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,160
OK.

486
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,040
What other competitions do you want?

487
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,160
Shooting.

488
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,400
Sir!

489
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,280
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng wants to
compete with me in shooting!

490
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,200
Please advise!

491
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,840
You haven't received
shooting training yet.

492
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,120
And it's not included
in the competency test.

493
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,000
Not approved.

494
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Company Commander!

495
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,080
Squad One of Platoon One is here!

496
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,120
Please advise!

497
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,680
Fall in!

498
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,360
Yes, sir!

499
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Down!

500
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Comrades, I'll introduce you.

501
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,080
This is Comrade Ye Guohua,
the new platoon leader.

502
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,800
Applause!

503
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,800
Hello, comrades.

504
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
My name is Ye Guohua.

505
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,400
Starting today,

506
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
I'll be a platoon leader
in this recruit company.

507
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,800
I hope you'll all have a fearless spirit

508
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,600
during future training,

509
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,720
and practice hard and right.

510
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,000
The sweat your shed
on the training ground

511
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,760
will make you shed
less blood on the battlefield.

512
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,240
I hope you'll all become

513
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,840
qualified Chinese soldiers.

514
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes, sir!

515
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Hello.

516
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
Hongling, it's me, Guohua.

517
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,280
Guohua,

518
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,160
I heard you became a platoon leader
at the recruit company.

519
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,840
Yes. I just took office.

520
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Then did you see...

521
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,160
That's why I called.

522
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I met Chunsheng.

523
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
How is he?

524
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
He has been here for so many days,

525
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,080
but I haven't seen him yet.

526
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm so busy touring all day

527
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,480
that I don't even have time
to catch my breath.

528
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,200
Chunsheng asked you to call me?

529
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,280
No.

530
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
We just met each other in a hurry.

531
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
There were other officers there,

532
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,840
so we didn't even talk to each other.

533
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
How is he? Is he used to it?

534
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,480
You know him.

535
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
He shines wherever he goes.

536
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,200
Their squad leader
even praised him to me,

537
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,280
saying that he was talented.

538
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
That means their squad leader
has a good eye.

539
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,680
At the welcome performance
for new recruits,

540
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
we'll see each other.

541
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,120
Hongling, I...

542
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,040
Hongling!

543
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,280
Mrs. Huang is looking for you.

544
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,280
Coming!

545
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,520
Guohua, they are looking for me.

546
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,120
I have to go.

547
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,320
OK. Go ahead.

548
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,880
Take care.

549
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,960
A complete defeat.

550
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,560
Chunsheng,

551
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,640
that was a complete defeat.

552
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,320
I was careless.

553
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
That's not the problem, Chunsheng.

554
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,880
Obviously, you are

555
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,280
no match for Duan Lei.

556
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,800
That's right.

557
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,760
He has such a strong body.

558
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
108 pull-ups!

559
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,000
That's unbelievable!

560
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,400
It's not Chunsheng's fault.

561
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,040
Nobody can compete with him.

562
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,280
Dude,

563
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,720
you are right about that.

564
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
We city boys

565
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
were spoiled since childhood.

566
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,200
We might be good in the city,

567
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
but in the troops, we are nothing at all.

568
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,920
If you ask me,

569
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,320
what we need is practice.

570
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,800
No way!

571
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,000
I, Xiao Chunsheng, have never lost.

572
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I just can't accept

573
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,080
this failure.

574
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,760
Chunsheng,

575
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,480
among us,

576
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,320
you are the strongest.

577
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,800
We are

578
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,680
not even close.

579
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,240
If even you can't defeat him,

580
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
none of us

581
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,160
will be able to do that.

582
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
That's right, Chunsheng.

583
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
You have to fight for us.

584
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,440
Yes, Chunsheng.

585
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
You need to figure this out.

586
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,920
Don't worry.

587
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,400
I will get back what I lost!

588
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,560
I will definitely restore my dignity!

589
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,120
- Good!
- Great!

590
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,040
Xiao Chunsheng,

591
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,080
the platoon leader asked you
to go to his office.

592
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,480
OK.

593
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,040
Excuse me.

594
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Report!

595
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
Platoon Leader Ye.

596
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,850
Chunsheng, come in.

597
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,600
Just call me Guohua.

598
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,360
This is the army.

599
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
You are my superior after all.

600
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,360
Chunsheng,

601
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,600
I don't think it that way.

602
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,240
It's been a long time. Let me see.

603
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,640
You are thinner,

604
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,600
but stronger.

605
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,960
And you are tan now.

606
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,600
Three months later,

607
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
you will be like me.

608
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Take a seat.

609
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,000
Are you used to the troops?

610
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm good.

611
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,320
I met a really strong young man.

612
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,400
The one who competed with you?

613
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,480
Yes. He is Duan Lei.

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,720
He is as strong

615
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,920
as a bull.

616
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,880
I just can't beat him.

617
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,120
It was so embarrassing.

618
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,640
You were good enough already.

619
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,800
70 pull-ups, what else do you want?

620
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Guohua,

621
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,760
now I understand

622
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,400
why they say
there's always someone stronger.

623
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,000
Back then,

624
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,400
you and I and our brothers,

625
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,920
we competed every day on everything.

626
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
Once we won,

627
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,160
we would think we were invincible.

628
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
Actually, think about it now,

629
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,280
how many people
were around us at that time?

630
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
We were being ridiculous.

631
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,240
At here,

632
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,360
I really feel my eyes are opened.

633
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
That's right.

634
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
You haven't seen Hongling yet, right?

635
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,760
Not yet.

636
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,640
They went out on a tour,

637
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,760
and will be back tomorrow.

638
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,920
They will perform
on the welcome performance.

639
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
You'll see her then.

640
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,600
After that performance,

641
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,680
will we have time to hang out?

642
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
What are you thinking?

643
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,400
There are rules in the recruit company.

644
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,280
You have no private time during training.

645
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,680
If you want to meet Hongling,

646
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
wait until the training is over.

647
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
You have waited for so long.

648
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
Be patient.

649
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,600
You're right.

650
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,280
I haven't congratulated you on
being promoted yet.

651
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,080
I am your soldier now.

652
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
Whatever you want in the future,

653
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,520
just give me an order.

654
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
Do not worry.

655
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,080
I've been in the army for so long,
I know what I'm doing.

656
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,280
OK, glad to hear that.

657
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,760
I am worrying too much.

658
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,600
In the army,

659
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
everyone should follow orders.

660
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,560
It's all iron discipline, I understand.

661
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,120
Anyway, thank you.

662
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,600
For what?

663
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,360
Your business is my business.

664
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,920
Platoon Leader Ye,
do you have any other orders?

665
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
Stop talking like that.

666
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,720
You should go. I'll walk you out.

667
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
Don't. Remember, I'm just a soldier.

668
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,160
I'll leave by myself.

669
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,200
OK.

670
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Goodbye.

671
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,500
(Welcome Performance for New Recruits)

672
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,600
Hongling, come here.

673
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,360
OK.

674
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,560
The next performance

675
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,280
is My Motherland by the orchestra.

676
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,800
Conductor, Li Shiyin.

677
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,240
Concertmaster, He Hongling.

678
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Rise!

679
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,520
Salute!

680
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,020
(Welcome Performance for New Recruits)

681
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,670
Rise!

682
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,270
Salute!

683
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,600
Hongling.

684
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:12,720
Ma'am.

685
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
Well done.

686
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,280
It was impressive.

687
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,880
During rehearsals,

688
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,760
I was worried that
your emotions wouldn't be enough.

689
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,600
But your performance tonight

690
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,400
was almost perfect.

691
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,880
Thank you, ma'am.

692
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,720
You flatter me.

693
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,400
In the future,

694
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
just do it as how you did it tonight.

695
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:27,880
Yes.

696
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Okay, go on.

697
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,760
That's unfair.

698
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,840
Why did Mrs. Huang only praise her?

699
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,560
What do you want?

700
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,560
Mrs. Huang praised me

701
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,880
because she liked our performance.

702
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,640
Anyway, we are a group.

703
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,520
She praised me

704
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,880
because we cooperated well.

705
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,080
If I were criticized,

706
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,200
nobody would be happy.

707
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,480
Anyway,

708
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,000
just for tonight's performance,

709
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,440
I think you did well too.

710
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,880
I am sincerely happy

711
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
that we offered the audience
a perfect show.

712
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,760
What about you?

713
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
I didn't say I'm not happy.

714
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,320
That's great.

715
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,200
I hope we will have
a happy cooperation in the future.

716
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,520
Rise!

717
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,160
Salute!

718
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,160
Down!

719
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,000
Sir.

720
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,000
Qian Amao.

721
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,560
Sir!

722
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,000
What's wrong with your bedding?

723
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,080
Sir!

724
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,320
I took a rest just now,

725
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,800
and was not ready.

726
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,160
You came too suddenly.

727
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,680
(Notice Check your bedding at 10:00)
What is written on it?

728
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,960
Sir, it says we should
check our own bedding.

729
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,600
But I didn't know you and
the platoon leader would come.

730
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
Qian Amao!

731
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,920
Sir!

732
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,080
You planned to

733
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,240
ignore the notice?

734
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,080
Military discipline

735
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,160
is a must-have quality for every soldier.

736
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Do you think this is your bedroom?

737
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,320
You are not like a soldier at all!

738
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,640
Sir!

739
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,160
- I...
- Sir,

740
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Qian Amao is indeed wrong,

741
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
but as his comrade-in-arms,

742
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,960
I will help him in the future

743
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,640
on having good military discipline.

744
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Please rest assured!

745
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,320
Sir,

746
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,200
Comrade Qian Amao

747
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
has already realized his mistake.

748
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,800
And Comrade Xiao Chunsheng

749
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
is willing to

750
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
help Qian Amao.

751
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,680
Could you please...

752
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,720
Why are you laughing, Meng Jinzhu?

753
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Sir, I don't agree with that!

754
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,480
Why don't you agree?

755
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,680
Your name is Meng Jinzhu?

756
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,280
Yes.

757
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
If I recall it correctly,

758
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,680
your father should be

759
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,960
Commander Meng Tao,

760
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,240
the famous war hero
during the War of Liberation.

761
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,520
Is that right?

762
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,920
Meng Jinzhu.

763
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Sir.

764
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,320
I am me,

765
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,320
not my dad.

766
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,880
He deserves to be
the role model of all soldiers,

767
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,880
of course,

768
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
including me.

769
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,000
But besides that,

770
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,320
he has nothing to do with me.

771
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I want to make new achievements.

772
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,920
I don't want to rest on the merits
of the previous generation!

773
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,800
That's why

774
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,760
I hope all my comrades-in-arms

775
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,120
would not mention my dad again.

776
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,480
I believe that you, sir,

777
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,840
must understand what I'm saying.

778
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,200
As far as I know,

779
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,640
your father

780
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,800
was also a commander
with great achievements

781
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,240
in our army.

782
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,960
Comrades,

783
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,720
Comrade Meng Jinzhu's

784
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
fighting spirit

785
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,240
is very good.

786
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,680
We should learn from
Comrade Meng Jinzhu.

787
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,360
But I have to say,

788
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,840
in future battles,

789
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,560
we will shoulder

790
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
the most dangerous, difficult,

791
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,320
and complex tasks.

792
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
This requires us

793
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,720
to have steel-like discipline
in addition to political reliability

794
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,720
and excellent military skills.

795
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,680
Comrade Meng Jinzhu,

796
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,440
after I asked you a question just now,

797
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,360
not only did you not answer me directly,

798
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,440
you said something I didn't ask you.

799
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,000
This means

800
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,280
your discipline

801
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,120
needs to be further strengthened.

802
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,880
You are right, sir.

803
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,080
Similarly,

804
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,840
I don't want anyone in the army

805
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,160
to get special treatment
by having a good relationship

806
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,480
with someone.

807
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,740
What do you mean by that?

808
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,220
I think

809
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,540
you understand me very well, sir.

810
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,300
Sir!

811
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,860
Meng Jinzhu is right.

812
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,300
Our squad failed
the sanitation inspection,

813
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,580
so we deserved to be punished.

814
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,740
We are willing to accept it.

815
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,220
But he's wrong about one thing.

816
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,780
The platoon leader and I

817
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,300
grew up together.

818
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,820
I know him best.

819
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,740
He is the most impartial man.

820
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,420
So I think

821
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,740
Meng Jinzhu should apologize
to the platoon leader.

822
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,260
Qian Amao.

823
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,100
Sir!

824
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,540
50 push-ups.

825
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,660
Your bedding is messy
and you tried to quibble.

826
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,660
You must be severely punished.

827
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,980
I didn't say much.

828
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,980
100.

829
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,460
Yes, sir!

830
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,100
You have to remember that

831
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,060
from the first day you entered the army

832
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,940
until the day you take off your uniform

833
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,900
and leave the army,

834
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,940
you will be a group.

835
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,860
In the army,

836
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,460
don't think that you can achieve anything

837
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,420
by yourself.

838
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,780
Let me tell you,

839
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,020
you yourself can't achieve anything.

840
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,700
Your achievements
belong to the collective.

841
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,700
Similarly,

842
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,180
when one of you makes a mistake,
you should take the fault together.

843
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,820
Do you understand?

844
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,620
Yes!

845
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,220
Yanqiu.

846
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,780
There is a letter for you.

847
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,460
Thank you.

848
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,580
Dad, have you taken your medicine?

849
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,140
Dad.

850
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,420
Mr. Xiao just fell asleep
after taking the medicine.

851
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,780
Why are you here, Xiaomei?

852
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,820
When Chunsheng left,
he specifically told me

853
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,100
that I shouldn't bother you a lot.

854
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,860
He didn't want to disturb
your exam preparation.

855
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,260
I was worried about Mr. Xiao,

856
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,900
so I just dropped by.

857
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:38,940
Thank you.

858
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,740
(People's Liberation Army
of the People's Republic of China)

859
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,660
Chunsheng sent a letter?

860
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,100
He has been thoughtful
since he was a child.

861
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,900
He knows that

862
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,580
our dad wants to know
what's happening in the army,

863
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,660
so he writes a letter every few days.

864
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,500
By the way,

865
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,180
please read it for me.

866
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,980
I have to cook.

867
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,180
Thanks.

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Tomorrow,

869
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,140
I have to write back to Chunsheng,

870
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,220
and write another letter to Hongling.

871
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,540
I haven't heard from her for a long time.

872
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,740
Yanqiu,

873
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,940
(Letter Paper for CPLA)
are you and Dad doing well recently?

874
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,380
I'm fine in the army,

875
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
you don't have to worry about me.

876
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,480
Guohua is now our platoon leader.

877
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,860
His performance is impressive.

878
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,180
Our daily training is very hard,

879
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,540
but it makes me excited,

880
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,380
because I finally met my match.

881
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,700
This frustrates me

882
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,340
but also excites me.
