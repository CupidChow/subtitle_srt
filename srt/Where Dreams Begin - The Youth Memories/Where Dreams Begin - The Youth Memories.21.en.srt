=Episode 21=

3
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
Too many passengers.

4
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
If I was a little bit late,

5
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,800
I couldn't even get any hot water.

6
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,360
Let me do it.

7
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm OK.

8
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,920
Xiaomei,

9
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
you know what?

10
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
When you were away,

11
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,920
the train attendant came to me.

12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
She said, if I need anything,

13
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,040
I can go straight to her.

14
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
See?

15
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Now I enjoy the privilege

16
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
for cripples.

17
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Xiaomei,

18
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
when we reach the next station Qujing,

19
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
you get off the train.

20
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,040
Chunsheng,

21
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,920
let me tell you the truth.

22
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,560
When you ended up in the hospital

23
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,800
and I knew

24
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,720
you could only be cured in Beijing,

25
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
I submitted the report on demobilization.

26
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,360
The war is over, anyway.

27
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I've done my duty

28
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,960
as a soldier.

29
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
I should go take care of someone

30
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,400
who needs me.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,360
Xiaomei, I don't need you.

32
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,320
I can take care of myself.

33
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Really.

34
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,960
Come on.

35
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,880
If you still worry,

36
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
think about the train attendant.

37
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,520
She offered to help, huh?

38
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
You don't need to worry.

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
Right?

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Have an orange.

41
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,960
But Xiaomei, I...

42
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Eat it.

43
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,880
Xiaomei,

44
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
you take the train with me

45
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,520
and I really appreciate it.

46
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,480
But...

47
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
But the rest of the journey...

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Let me take it alone.

49
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
I don't want to feel

50
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,120
that I'm a loser
who has to be taken care of.

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
My report has been approved, anyway.

52
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,800
Now, I'm escorting you back to Beijing.

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,720
After that, even if you need me,

54
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
I won't trouble about you.

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
You're not a loser.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
You are a hero,

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,960
a true hero.

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
And,

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
stop calling yourself a cripple.

60
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
After you have the operation in Beijing,

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,480
you'll get back on your feet.

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
Then you're still what you used to be.

I...

91
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't say it.

92
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,280
Don't say anything.

Don't worry.

00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920

I... I'll go boil some water.

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Tian.

105
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
Go buy some food in the canteen.

106
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,200
OK. I'll be on it.

107
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,960
I'll go boil the water.

108
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Yanqiu,

109
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
I contacted bone doctors in the hospital

110
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,680
where I used to work

111
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,800
and showed them
Chunsheng's medical record.

112
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
They think

113
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
if an operation is performed
to take out the shrapnel,

114
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
he's possible

115
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
to get back on his feet.

116
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,920
Xiaomei,

117
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,760
I don't know what to say.

118
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,320
Thank you.

119
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm really grateful.

120
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,520
Chunsheng told me.

121
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,080
You were even demobilized for him.

122
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,040
Yanqiu,

123
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,720
my dream is to be a doctor.

124
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,640
Working in the army or a city

125
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,920
wouldn't be different.

126
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,480
Chunsheng is a patient.

127
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
It's my job to take care of him.

128
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,360
Thank you. Thank you so much.

129
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,360
Stop talking about me.

130
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,320
Yanqiu, are you and Tian...

131
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,080
Come on. Let me get you some water.

132
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Yanqiu, just now,

133
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,480
when we were walking out of the station,

134
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,880
a puddle was ahead of us.

135
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
Tian warned you of that.

136
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
He cared so much about you.

137
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,120
You must be thirsty.

138
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,040
Have some water.

139
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,400
Tian is really a good man.

140
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,200
He isn't.

141
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,440
He's just an ignoramus.

142
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,080
What did you say about me?

143
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,760
I heard you.

144
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,680
We were saying...

145
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
Umm...

146
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,560
Just...

147
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,160
Have you brought back the food?

148
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,320
Yes.

149
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,960
I'll go make some porridge.

150
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,160
Xiaomei got us an appointment
with the expert.

151
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
At ten tomorrow morning.

152
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,400
After we leave Dad's grave,
we have to go there immediately.

153
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,400
Yanqiu,

154
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
Tian is a good man.

155
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,800
He made a mistake before.

156
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,400
But over all these years,
he has cleaned up his act.

157
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
If you like him,

158
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
marry him.

159
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
Our family has held you up for years.

160
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,160
In the future,

161
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
you should live for yourself.

162
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,320
What are you talking about?

163
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
Getting bored of me?

164
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,520
Girlfriend over sister, huh?

165
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,310
How's Hongling doing?

166
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,310
Hongling...

167
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
She's doing great.

168
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Her superiors think highly of her.

169
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,920
Now,

170
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
she's the leader of her orchestra.

171
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,200
Sounds great.

172
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,280
But so sad,

173
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
in a year or two,

174
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
- you're in Beijing, but she...
- Yanqiu.

175
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,760
Hongling and I broke up.

176
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,520
She thinks you're a burden?

177
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Yanqiu, what are you thinking?

178
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,800
Hongling isn't like that.

179
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,160
I asked to break up.

180
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,440
She can have a better career there.

181
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
I don't want her to return with me

182
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,000
in case she regrets it in a few years.

183
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,280
But you needn't have broken up.

184
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,440
Just a long-distance relationship
for two years.

185
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,880
After you recover,
you can go back to her.

186
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,960
At ease.

187
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,320
Attention.

188
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
Sir, the regimental commander
asked to see you.

189
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,600
Guohua.

190
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,280
What are you doing here?

191
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
Your leader gave you a talk again?

192
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,240
Now, I'm a soldier

193
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,760
of some renown, anyway.

194
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,840
It's normal for him to care about me.

195
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,720
Be serious.

196
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,640
He said

197
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
whether the title of combat hero

198
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,120
belongs to Chunsheng or me

199
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,200
will be decided after a meeting
the day after tomorrow.

200
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Don't worry about me.

201
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,680
Now that I told the truth,

202
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,920
I wouldn't scramble for it.

203
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,560
And anyway,

204
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,360
it's Chunsheng's honor.

205
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,120
Guohua,

206
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,840
I'd like to thank you on his behalf.

207
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Don't say that.

208
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
After telling the truth,

209
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
I feel much more relieved, too.

210
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,040
And...

211
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,680
Most importantly,

212
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,360
I don't want you to think

213
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,880
I'm a bad guy who can distort the truth

214
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
and betray his friend just for honor.

215
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm not that kind of man.

216
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,920
On the battlefield,

217
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,720
I also fought bravely

218
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,360
and did what a soldier should do.

219
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,920
For my comrades-in-arms,

220
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,080
I could also bleed without hesitation

221
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,800
and even lose my life.

222
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,200
It was dishonorable to take this credit.

223
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,240
I don't deny that.

224
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,480
I struggled.

225
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I still did the wrong thing.

226
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,360
But I want to tell you this.

227
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
Because of you,

228
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,640
I became brave enough
to face the mistake I made.

229
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
I hope in your heart,

230
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
I'm always an honest man.

231
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,200
Are you addicted to giving a speech?

232
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Come. I'll buy you lunch.

233
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,760
(The Military Party Committee
discussed it and decided)

234
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
(that Xiao Chunsheng and Ye Guohua)

235
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
(both deserved the credit.)

236
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,280
(The title of combat hero
would also be given to Xiao Chunsheng.)

237
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,680
Xiaomei,

238
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,600
will you keep silent

239
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,960
instead of explaining anything to us?

240
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,920
He's my patient

241
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,800
and the combat hero.

242
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
For our nation

243
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,600
and its people,

244
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
he was badly wounded.

245
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,520
As I doctor

246
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,880
and for humanitarianism,

247
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
I escorted him home.

248
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,440
To escort him home,

249
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,080
did you need to apply for demobilization?

250
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
Are you out of your mind?

251
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,280
Who are you to him?

252
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I heard

253
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Xiao Chunsheng had a girlfriend.

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Even his girlfriend didn't return.

255
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Why did you follow him back?

256
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,840
We're friends.

257
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,760
Can't I help him?

258
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,840
Don't find excuses.

259
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,520
Tong Xiaomei!

260
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,800
You are so spoiled by us!

261
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,280
so that you're that unrestrained?

262
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
Regardless of anything,

263
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
you were demobilized without telling us!

264
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Is this what your father
and I taught you?

265
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Didn't you say
you dreamed to be a doctor?

266
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,760
Your father and I supported you, right?

267
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,640
And you?

268
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
What did you do in return?

269
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,840
For a man who's just your friend,

270
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,480
you gave up the principles.

271
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,480
Don't worry.

272
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,840
This time, your mother and I
won't show any mercy.

273
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
I told you

274
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,720
I'll be the master of my own life.

275
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,440
Dad,

276
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Mom,

277
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,360
Xiaomei, sorry to keep you waiting.

279
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
Nothing. I just arrived.

280
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,040
How do you feel? Tired?

281
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,320
Why would I feel tired?

282
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,200
I've been sitting

283
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,360
and I don't wheel myself.

284
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm tired.

285
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,400
Xiaomei, food in your army must be great.

286
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,240
Chunsheng gained some weight.

287
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,480
I can hardly wheel him.

288
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm just stronger, OK?

289
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,320
Look.

290
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
Here's the shrapnel.

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,320
Seen from the X-ray,

292
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
here are two pieces of 5mm shrapnel.

293
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,240
Here.

294
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,920
And here.

295
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,560
You're young

296
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,400
and you may not feel bad now.

297
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,200
But as you get older

298
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,160
and your bones age,

299
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,480
you may gradually feel the pain.

300
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Especially on cold,
cloudy, or rainy days,

301
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,440
the pain may last for a long time

302
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
and you have to lie in bed.

303
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,280
With the shrapnel stuck

304
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,320
in this position,

305
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,080
you may have local inflammation.

306
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,680
In worse cases,

307
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,320
the shrapnel may even move.

308
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,920
And then,

309
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,560
it'll lead to bigger damage.

310
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,440
Yesterday, you proposed the operation.

311
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
We discussed it

312
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,120
and he'll take the operation.

313
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
We recommend the operation.

314
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,200
When the shrapnel is taken out,

315
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
all risks can be removed.

316
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,160
But the operation is risky, too.

317
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
So, I have to tell you everything.

318
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,440
Look.

319
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
The shrapnel is in the spine.

320
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,720
Nearby blood vessels and nerves
are very complicated.

321
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,280
The operation

322
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,680
may injure you again.

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,600
If your nerves are hurt

324
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,600
or if you have postoperative infections,

325
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,200
you might be crippled for life.

326
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,920
Doctor,

327
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,720
which plan

328
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,640
do you think is more feasible

329
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,400
and safer?

330
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
Conservative treatment

331
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,080
can't completely solve his problem.

332
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
But with proper recuperation,

333
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
his life won't be in danger.

334
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,040
The operation

335
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,680
may get him fully recovered.

336
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,400
But during and after the operation,

337
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,560
there are huge risks.

338
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,880
Medicine isn't
a complete theoretical science.

339
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,720
In most cases, the efficacy varies

340
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,360
from patient to patient.

341
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,600
As a doctor,

342
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,320
I can only give you options

343
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,040
and tell you detailed risks.

344
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,640
The choice should be made

345
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,080
by the patient and his family.

346
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,960
Xiaomei,

347
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,200
you're a doctor, too.

348
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,800
How about you make a decision?

349
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
Doctor,

350
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,000
I read about your papers
on spinal endoscopic techniques.

351
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Especially the one you translated

352
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,800
from Kambin, a German professor.

353
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
In that paper, you mentioned

354
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,600
that a spine operation
performed with the arthroscope

355
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,320
can have a recovery rate of 70%.

356
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Doctor,

357
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
70%.

358
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Isn't that high?

359
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
No.

360
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,280
The failure rate is 30%.

361
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,640
If the operation fails...

362
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,400
He might be crippled for life

363
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
or even lose his life.

364
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
If I don't take the operation,

365
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
I can never stand up, right?

366
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
With perfect rehabilitation,

367
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
you might be able to stand.

368
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,800
However,

369
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,880
considering the shrapnel might move,

370
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
we'll suggest

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
doing less movement, including walking.

372
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
I'll take the operation.

373
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,920
I have a 70% probability

374
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,440
to fully recover, right?

375
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,720
For the remaining 30%,

376
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,840
I'll count on the new technique
you and Xiaomei mentioned.

377
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,460
(Serve the People)

378
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,500
(Develop art activities to consolidate
the socialist ideological front)

379
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,040
Hongling,

380
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,320
congratulations on becoming
the head of the orchestra.

381
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm leaving the orchestra to you now.

382
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,320
Congratulations.

383
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,800
Congratulations, Hongling.

384
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Congratulations.

385
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Thank you, Commander.

386
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,040
I'll lead the orchestra very well

387
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,160
and we'll perfectly complete our missions

388
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
given by the Party Organization.

389
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
Guys, hope we'll cooperate very well.

390
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,440
- OK.
- OK.

391
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
Ms. He, congratulations.

392
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,760
Congratulations.

393
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
We will, Ms. He.

394
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,920
Congratulations.

395
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,680
Congratulations on your promotion.

396
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Thanks.

397
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,320
What's wrong, Hongling?

398
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Feeling bad about your promotion?

399
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,480
No.

400
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
It's a good day.

401
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,320
How about we go out for a ride?

402
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,280
OK.

403
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
So quickly?

404
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Don't you ask me where we would go?

405
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,360
What if I sell you?

406
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
Then I must have my share.

407
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,480
Hongling, be careful.

408
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
Maybe the fast speed

409
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,040
is the real freedom I pursue.

410
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,880
If you like this,

411
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,560
I'll take you out more often.

412
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,400
There you are, Hongjun, Ye Fang.

413
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,520
Chunsheng.

414
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,720
Chunsheng.

415
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Don't have this worried look.

416
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,160
You're going to be a cadre.

417
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,240
Be steadier.

418
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,240
I'm not recruited yet,

419
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,720
but you already knew?

420
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
My sister told me.

421
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
She said,

422
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
Fang would have further education

423
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,760
and you would be a cadre.

424
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,160
Good.

425
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
In this case,

426
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
you'll be a civil servant.

427
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Fang's case has been settled.

428
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,240
But I'll still have an interview.

429
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,360
You won't have any trouble.

430
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,000
You're the best student among us

431
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,400
and the president of the Student Union.

432
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,360
Don't be nervous

433
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,480
and just do your best.

434
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,720
You'll pass it.

435
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,920
When is the operation?

436
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,520
Tomorrow.

437
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,560
Chunsheng,

438
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,280
why didn't you tell us you were back?

439
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
I met Yanqiu today.

440
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
Or I wouldn't know about your operation.

441
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
I'll go wash some fruit.

442
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,040
Let me help you.

443
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Be seated.

444
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,440
Chunsheng.

445
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,640
Hongjun,

446
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
when is the interview?

447
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,040
Tomorrow morning.

448
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,440
Then, I can't keep you company.

449
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,000
Don't be nervous. Get prepared.

450
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,480
Chunsheng, hope you'll have
a successful operation, too.

451
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,400
After I pass the interview,

452
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,600
I'll get you a job.

453
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,960
Don't pull strings.

454
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm so nervous.

455
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,080
Later,

456
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,640
don't drink too much water.

457
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,520
Or you would go to the toilet often
and be teased.

458
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,280
And...

459
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,920
Listen carefully to the questions.

460
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,680
Think carefully before you answer, OK?

461
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,320
Got it.

462
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,040
Don't be nervous.

463
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,840
Ye Fang.

464
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
If I pass the interview,

465
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,800
let's get married.

466
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,200
OK?

467
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,720
He's proposing to her.

468
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,360
Look at them.

469
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,360
You didn't propose to me like this.

470
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,680
There you are.

471
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm getting in, then.

472
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,900
(In Operation)

473
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,340
(In Operation)

474
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,100
(In Operation)

475
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,900
(Operating Room)

476
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,880
Doctor, how was the operation?

477
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,440
The shrapnel is taken out.

478
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
But whether

479
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,670
his spinal nerves are hurt

480
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,600
can't be clear until he wakes up.

481
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,630
Thank you. Thank you.

482
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,600
Take him back to the ward.

483
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Go.

484
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,240
Try moving your foot.

485
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
It moved!

486
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,040
He can move his foot!

487
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,360
Yanqiu, Yanqiu,

488
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,200
I can move my foot!

489
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,960
Yes.

490
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,440
Yes.

491
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,160
Right, right.

492
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,840
Xiaomei, come out with me.

493
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
Come on, come on.

494
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,240
Cover yourself.

495
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,080
Don't catch a cold.

496
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,480
You know what?

497
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,320
You should move more often.

498
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,880
And I'll rub your legs

499
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,160
to invigorate the blood circulation.

500
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,640
Xiaomei,

501
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,360
things are a little bit better

502
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,280
than they expected.

503
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,080
But I found

504
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,400
that he had few sensations
in his right leg.

505
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,280
Perhaps, nearby nerves were hurt

506
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,880
when the shrapnel was being taken out

507
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,680
during the operation.

508
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,960
It depends on his recovery

509
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,560
and rehabilitation.

510
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,400
I get it.

511
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,640
I should go, then.

512
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,040
Xiaomei, what did the doctor say?

513
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,600
She said,

514
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
the operation was successful.

515
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,800
When Chunsheng takes good rehabilitation,

516
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,360
he can get back 90%
of his exercise performance.

517
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,440
She would also

518
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,040
- ask her mother about the rehabilitation center.
- You're all right now.

519
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,200
When Chunsheng recovers, he can go there.

520
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,200
OK, OK.

521
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,920
Later, I'll tell his leader in the army

522
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,120
about this good news.

523
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,040
He's been worried
about Chunsheng's operation

524
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,640
and called many times.

525
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,280
Qi Tian,

526
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,200
how about we go buy some food?

527
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,720
OK.

528
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Let's go.

529
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,400
Xiaomei,

530
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,160
thank you.

531
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm really grateful.

532
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,760
You recommended me the doctor

533
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
and she proposed a new operation plan.

534
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,600
Otherwise,

535
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,000
my operation wouldn't be so successful

536
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,360
and I couldn't recover so quickly.

537
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,560
You're welcome.

538
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
You'll have rehabilitation soon.

539
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,960
I'll keep you company all the time.

540
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,120
Xiaomei,

541
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
don't hold yourself up

542
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,160
for me anymore.

543
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,600
My dream can't come true, anyway.

544
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
But you should waste

545
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,600
no more time on me.

546
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,680
And the doctor just said

547
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,680
I was doing very well.

548
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,200
You don't need to worry.

549
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
Things are a little bit better

550
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,680
than they expected.

551
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,800
His basic sensations

552
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,040
weren't hurt.

553
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,600
But,

554
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,640
I found

555
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,160
that he had few sensations
in his right leg.

556
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,200
Perhaps, nearby nerves were hurt

557
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,040
when the shrapnel was being taken out

558
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,880
during the operation.

559
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
It depends on his recovery

560
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,160
and rehabilitation.

561
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,820
(Physical Therapy)

562
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,200
Come on.

563
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,520
Slowly.

564
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,480
Very good.

565
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,640
Hang in there.

566
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,600
Come on.

567
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,520
Push my hand.

568
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,760
Well done.

569
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,160
Breathe out.

570
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,360
Slowly. Slowly.

571
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,480
Good.

572
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,120
Very good.

573
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,040
Relax.

574
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,800
You're getting much better.

575
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,120
I believe it won't be long

576
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,600
before you can walk.

577
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
Hope so.

578
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,280
OK. Take some rest.

579
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,120
Xiaomei, have you got any plans?

580
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,360
I've never changed my mind.

581
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
My parents contacted some hospitals

582
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
where I would try getting a job.

583
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,480
Sounds good.

584
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,120
You'll get a job.

585
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,240
Don't worry about me.

586
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm...

587
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm doing very well.

588
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,720
The operation was successful.

589
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,920
I'm also doing great

590
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,040
in recent rehabilitation training.

591
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,800
For future rehabilitation,

592
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,320
I can do it alone.

593
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,200
Rest assured.

594
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,480
To make your hard effort

595
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,680
pay off,

596
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,240
I will stand up personally

597
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,840
and say thank you in your face.

598
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,600
OK.

599
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,960
Don't move and take enough rest.

600
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,600
Stand up personally?

601
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,520
Or who else would stand for you?

602
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,040
Tomorrow, Tian and Yanqiu will come
and get you home.

603
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,080
I have a job interview

604
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,360
and I won't come, then.

605
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,840
All right.

606
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,200
What?

607
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
Are you done packing?

608
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,040
Without Xiaomei,

609
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
it's really hard.

610
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,880
Going through the formalities
up and down stairs

611
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,160
totally confused me.

612
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,040
Chunsheng,

613
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,200
what's Xiaomei's plan for the future?

614
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,360
She said

615
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,820
she found a job in a hospital

616
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
and she wanted to have a try.

617
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,040
My silly brother,

618
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,840
she just said that to relieve you.

619
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,080
Now, without passing an exam

620
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,440
or having a medical license,

621
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,720
it's nearly impossible
to work in a hospital.

622
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,320
I guess

623
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,760
she won't try to get a job

624
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,120
until you recover.
