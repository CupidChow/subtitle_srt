=Episode 26=

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,120
My daughter wasn't willing to

4
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,960
play elsewhere other than

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,440
in my study when she was little.

6
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
At that time,

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
she was only this tall.

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,520
She was having fun
in my study in her free time.

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,760
I picked

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
one of her mom's medical books

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,040
and gave it to her.

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,440
I didn't think too much.

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,800
However, after a while,

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,960
she raised her head
and asked me a question.

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
Superior nasal concha.
Superior nasal meatus.

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,940
(Sphenoethmoidal recess)

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,960
Dad.

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
What is sphenoethmoidal recess?

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
That's my daughter.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
When she's determined,

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,960
no one can stop her.

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,160
She looked like this

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
when she decided to study medicine.

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,200
And she now looks like this too

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
when she

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
chooses you.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Now I understand.

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,720
She's determined

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
to choose you.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,920
Of course,

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
I've also heard

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,920
that you

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
have several brothers

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,400
and you had a girlfriend before.

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,680
Mr. Tong...

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
You don't need to explain it now.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,360
What is done is done.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,240
However,

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
when we were eating today,

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
my wife and I could tell

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
how much Xiaomei loves you

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480
from her eyes.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
We were once young too

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
and we know what's happening.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Mr. Tong,

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,920
don't worry.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
I will always take care

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,920
of Xiaomei.

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I trust you.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
However,

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
times have changed.

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,320
Things are changing fast

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
and there are lots of opportunities

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,760
and temptations.

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
They come into our lives

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,000
from different directions

57
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,360
in various waves.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Xiaomei said

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
that you're a man

60
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,600
of ideals and ambition.

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
This is good.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,280
However,

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,880
society is different from the army.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
Whether you can stick

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
to your ideals in this society

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
is another question.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
I have faith in myself.

68
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,560
Have you seen it?

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,720
A new watch.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,000
Is this Longines?

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,680
It's sold out in the whole city.

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
Where did you buy it?

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
In Shanghai.

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
My daughter was there on a business trip

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,720
and it took her a lot of effort to buy one.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Stop showing off.

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
Now, Titoni and Rado

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
are the best watchmakers in the country.

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Is yours better than them?

81
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,120
How can they compare to his?

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
The TV commercial says

83
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
that you can travel the world
with a Longines watch.

84
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,480
I've never seen Titoni watches on TV.

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,080
Enough.

86
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
Those who sell foreign goods
have the money to advertise

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
and the commercials boost their sales.

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,160
With more sales, they're even richer.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
I don't have money to advertise,

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so I can't sell much

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
and won't have much money.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
What's going on now?

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,640
It's all about money.

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
Isn't this capitalism?

95
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
I think if the government
doesn't intervene,

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,240
then we're doomed sooner or later.

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
It's not that bad.

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
Calm down, please.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,760
We just want to live a good life,

100
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
we don't think this much.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,400
Why are you still so moralistic?

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
He's just dogmatic.

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,440
That's the most reactionary.

104
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
The collective economy

105
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
has gone.

106
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
It's all about competitions now.

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,160
They just make commercials

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,680
to let you know
that there's such a product.

109
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,960
People won't buy it if it's not good.

110
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah, right.
We have a market economy now.

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
Exactly. Market economy.

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,720
You...

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
No, you can't cheat...

114
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,440
Here you are.

115
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,080
Sir,

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,720
we didn't order this.

117
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,640
This is for free.

118
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
No need for me to introduce him.

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,440
This is Qi Tian.

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
Tian, this is the Shrimp,
my childhood friend.

121
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760
He's a senior chef now.

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,720
You flatter me.

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
Tian, I should raise

124
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,400
a toast to you today,

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,600
unfortunately,

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm not allowed to drink at work.

127
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Okay, I won't bother you then.

128
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm not busy at all.

129
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,880
Look.

130
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
We don't even have customers now.

131
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
But the business was doing well
when I came here a while ago.

132
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,720
It's not doing well anymore.

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,120
Now,

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,240
nobody eats in old
state-run restaurants anymore.

135
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
There are lots of new restaurants
in Xidan and Wangfujing

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
and people go there.

137
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
Do you remember Wu?

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Wu has opened a shop in Wangfujing,

139
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
selling flatbread and meat.

140
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
The shop thrives.

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,240
The one who's pigeon-toed?

142
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
You're still looking down on Wu?

143
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Much has changed.

144
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,120
Our old friends

145
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
are living comfortable lives

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,920
by running clothing stores

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
or repair shops.

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,400
By the way,

149
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,520
there's another person.

150
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
And you both know him.

151
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Who?

152
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,920
Li Shangyou.

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Now he's very successful.

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
He owns big businesses.

155
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
A piece he wears

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
is worth 10,000 yuan at least.

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
When you see him,
you have to bow down too.

158
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,560
Whatever.

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,200
In the end, I have to bow down anyway.

160
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,280
To whom?

161
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,720
To life!

162
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Good.

163
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
You're mature now.

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,640
Well,

165
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
I'll leave you alone.

166
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,440
Enjoy.

167
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Chunsheng, it's been more than
half a year since your recovery.

168
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,600
What's your plan?

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
I haven't decided yet.

170
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,960
I know a way to make money.

171
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Do you want to join me?

172
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,640
What way to make money?

173
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Imported cigarettes.

174
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
Ye Fang, I mean,

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
today you have to explain

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,200
why you don't want me

177
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,150
to recruit Chunsheng
to the Anti-smuggling Squad.

178
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,640
I mean, I don't understand it.

179
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,880
I know you didn't like Chunsheng

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,480
before.

181
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,840
However, he's dating

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,400
your good friend Tong Xiaomei now.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
Maybe you should change your mind.

184
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,000
Listen,

185
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,200
it's been more than half a year
since Chunsheng's recovery.

186
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
He has to have a job.

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,920
And the Customs

188
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
happens to establish
the Anti-smuggling Squad now.

189
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,040
Veterans in their prime
are our top choice.

190
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,400
I think Chunsheng
suits this job very well

191
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
and I believe he will be good.

192
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
If he gets the job,

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,280
then we will be colleagues again

194
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,240
working for counterparts
of different levels.

195
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
Isn't that nice?

196
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
I said I'd ask,

197
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
and you didn't even
want me to mention it.

198
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't you think you're too bossy?

199
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Ye Fang,

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,560
listen,

201
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm really getting a bit angry.

202
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240
Putting other things aside,

203
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
let's talk about having children.

204
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
You don't want children

205
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,240
and I'm okay with that.

206
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,600
However, my mom

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
has talked to me
so many times about this.

208
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
There's nothing I could do,

209
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
I could only retort upon her.

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,680
And after that,

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,280
your mom came to
persuade me to have a child.

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,200
However,

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
this is not something I can decide alone.

214
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,160
You even have good reasons

215
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
for not having children.

216
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,400
Then why are you
so against Chunsheng getting this job?

217
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
Why?

218
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,640
I agree!

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,880
What did you say?

220
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,320
I said I agree.

221
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Go to tell Chunsheng.

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
Okay, thank you, darling.

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll call Chunsheng now.

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,040
Go ahead.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,320
Maybe he will say no.

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,400
That's impossible.

227
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
No matter whether he agrees or not,

228
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
the only thing I can tell you

229
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,400
is that you will surely
regret it in the future.

230
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,560
Chunsheng,

231
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,160
I've figured it out during this time.

232
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,680
Imported cigarettes

233
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,080
are the most lucrative.

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,440
First, everyone wants
to try the new cigarettes.

235
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,720
They're in great demand in small shops.

236
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Most importantly,
they're highly profitable.

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,640
In the end,

238
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,760
profit matters the most.

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
We're not young anymore.

240
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
It's time for me to be a father now.

241
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,200
I have to work harder.

242
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,760
You and Xiaomei have also met

243
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,280
each other's parents.

244
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
You two will get married sooner or later.

245
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
After you get married,

246
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
you'll know that
you need money everywhere.

247
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,520
That makes sense,

248
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
however,

249
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,960
is it legal to trade
in imported cigarettes now?

250
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
It's not declared illegal,

251
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
so let's take it as legal.

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,480
Also, I received my sales license

253
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,680
through lawful means.

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,360
So what's the problem?

255
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,200
Right?

256
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,760
Then what about the purchase channel?

257
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,040
Is it risky?

258
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
Tian, listen.

259
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
You're different from before.

260
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,840
I know.

261
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm only in charge of the sales.

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
Heizi is the one

263
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,640
who purchases the cigarettes.

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,480
Heizi is not doing well either now,

265
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,360
let's help him if we can,

266
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,320
okay?

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,680
If you're

268
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,640
interested,

269
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
then you can join me at any time.

270
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,240
Anyway, I've told you

271
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,160
the secrets about it.

272
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay. Let's drink.

273
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Cheers.

274
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,540
(Guangzhou Railway Station)

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,720
Brother.

276
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,520
Um...

277
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
A gold ring, a gold watch.

278
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
Are you rich now?

279
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,720
Tell me

280
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
how you got rich.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Buying and selling.

282
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes. I've heard of it.

283
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,600
You got this rich

284
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
by buying goods in Shenzhen
and selling them in Beijing?

285
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,640
You're only scratching the surface.

286
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,280
When I first arrived,
this was what I did.

287
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,200
I bought goods in Shenzhen
and sold them in Beijing

288
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,360
to earn a small amount of money.

289
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,600
I only found the secrets

290
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,960
of this business later.

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,440
That's it?

292
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,280
Brother, I want to know more.

293
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,400
Tell me about the secrets.

294
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Please tell me.

295
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,000
Actually,

296
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
I could only earn a small portion

297
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,960
when I was doing that.

298
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,600
Later, I thought

299
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,760
that I could earn the major portion

300
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,360
by purchasing from the suppliers myself.

301
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,960
From the suppliers?

302
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,120
How

303
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
to find them?

304
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,480
It's all about going through the Customs.

305
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
Then how did you do that?

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,360
On that day,

307
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,680
I wore a pair of sunglasses.

308
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
And I wore eye makeup

309
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
behind the sunglasses.

310
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,200
Those at the Customs asked me
to take off my sunglasses,

311
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,520
but I refused.

312
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,760
They thought that I was furtive

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
and tried to hide my identity.

314
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
After I saw that,

315
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,360
I made them wait for a while.

316
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,680
After I took the sunglasses off,

317
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I pointed at their faces

318
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,720
and asked them,

319
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,400
"Haven't you seen people
with a black eye?"

320
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,160
After such a fuss,

321
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,840
no one paid attention
to what I took with me

322
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
and they quickly let me go.

323
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,080
Brother, you're so smart.

324
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,000
What's the phrase?

325
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Doing one thing
under the cover of another.

326
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,120
Awesome.

327
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,600
After a few times,

328
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,840
now I'm a supplier too.

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,720
Brother,

330
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,920
can you teach me please?

331
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,560
Now,

332
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
I'm not doing much myself.

333
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,800
It's the job of my subordinates.

334
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
No.

335
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
That's not correct.

336
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm your brother too,

337
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,920
right?

338
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,240
They've only worked for you
for a short while,

339
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,480
but we've been friends for many years,

340
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,040
haven't we?

341
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm the one who knew you first.

342
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Also...

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
Honestly, brother,

344
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,080
I have to support
the old and young at home.

345
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,680
I really need money.

346
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Otherwise,

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,160
I wouldn't come from a distance

348
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,360
to the South to see you.

349
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,800
I really don't know what else to do.

350
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,600
Please let me join you.

351
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,120
Huh?

352
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,200
You really want to join?

353
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,440
Of course I do.

354
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,200
Sure.

355
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Next time I do business,

356
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
I'll give the goods to you.

357
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,040
You'll be wealthy soon.

358
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
I knew it.

359
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Come on, brother.

360
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,520
Brother,

361
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,840
how much we can earn

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
from one deal?

363
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Listen,

364
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,440
if we buy goods in Shenzhen
and sell them in Beijing,

365
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
the net profit from one deal
will equal the cost at least.

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,640
Equal the cost?

367
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,160
If I go through the Customs
and sell the goods in Beijing,

368
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,440
then the profit can
easily be three times the cost.

369
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,520
Then...

370
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
What is this lucrative?

371
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,680
Those are all small appliances

372
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,320
that are the most popular
and sought after now.

373
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,800
Even if the price is five times the cost,

374
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,720
they will still be sold out in a minute.
Do you believe it?

375
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes, I do.

376
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
Of course you won't lie to me.

377
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,560
Look.

378
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,240
We will carry 20 appliances at least

379
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
for a trip from Shenzhen to Beijing.

380
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,520
Twenty?

381
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Calculate

382
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,720
the profit.

383
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,560
Twenty appliances. Five times.

384
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,520
Sold out in a minute.

385
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,920
Can I believe it?

386
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,960
Anyway, I'm not good at calculating.

387
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
I'll just wait

388
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
for the day when I get rich.

389
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Eat your food.

390
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,040
Xiaomei,

391
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,590
Hongjun came to see me today.

392
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
What did he come for?

393
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,520
He wanted me to
join the Anti-smuggling Squad.

394
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,110
Do you want to join it?

395
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,520
Hongjun wanted me to
join the Anti-smuggling Squad,

396
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,160
and Tian also wanted me

397
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
to trade in imported cigarettes with him.

398
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
I have to choose one.

399
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
Otherwise, people will see me

400
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
as someone jobless and lazy.

401
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,840
Indeed.

402
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,840
I have to support you now.

403
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,960
Dr. Tong, the exam results
haven't been published,

404
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
but you're already sounding so confident.

405
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
You don't like either.

406
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,440
But you have to choose one,

407
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,960
right?

408
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,880
Guess I can't hide it from you.

409
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
What do you want to hide from me?

410
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
You don't want me to know

411
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
that you're wandering around every day

412
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,400
to find out what you should do next.

413
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Or, you don't want me to know

414
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,680
that you're in a dilemma

415
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,520
between the suggestions
of Tian and Hongjun.

416
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
Actually, you don't need to rush

417
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,160
or worry about living expenses.

418
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,520
I hope you can choose
your next career carefully.

419
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,400
I said I could support you.

420
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
I said this as a joke

421
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,240
but it's true as well.

422
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,360
You don't need to bear the burden.

423
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
I just want you to know

424
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,000
that we should,

425
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
and can support each other.

426
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,120
By "can", I mean

427
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,120
that I can rely on
and be supported by you

428
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,720
and you can also rely on
and be supported by me.

429
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,760
I know

430
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,520
that you don't want to have a job for life.

431
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
I also think

432
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,160
that you will do great things in the future.

433
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,440
If you don't have a plan now,

434
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,560
maybe you can just pick one

435
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,080
as your transitional job.

436
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,560
Maybe that will inspire you too.

437
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,160
Xiaomei,

438
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,360
we always have the same ideas.

439
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,680
Actually, that's what I think.

440
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,440
However,

441
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,600
this is the kindness of my friends.

442
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,960
I can't say no.

443
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
You've already decided,

444
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,560
what are you worrying about now?

445
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,600
I don't know which one to choose.

446
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't think

447
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,520
speculation

448
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
is respectable, after all.

449
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,720
The Anti-smuggling Squad
is a public work unit,

450
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
so I think this is

451
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,480
the better choice in comparison.

452
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,040
Okay, then I'll go
to the Anti-smuggling Squad.

453
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
Well, I'll tell Hongjun

454
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,360
and Tian tomorrow.

455
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,200
I believe Tian will understand.

456
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
However,

457
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm worried about your health.

458
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,520
Don't worry.

459
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,760
I know how to take care of myself.

460
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,440
Xiaomei,

461
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,360
thank you.

462
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,960
I feel happy

463
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,440
to be needed by you.

464
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,280
I always need you.

465
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Fang, when will Hongjun arrive?

466
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,920
We're just waiting for him.

467
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
He's been very busy recently

468
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,320
and even I can't see him often.

469
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,440
We don't need to wait for him,

470
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,360
let's start.

471
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,760
Okay.

472
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,120
Let's raise the first toast

473
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
to congratulate Xiaomei

474
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,160
on passing the recruitment exam
of the hospital.

475
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,400
She's now one step closer to her dream.

476
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,640
Cheers.

477
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,000
Cheers.

478
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
Congratulations.

479
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,640
Cheers. Congratulations.

480
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,360
Thank you, everyone.

481
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
This is only the first step.

482
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,720
I believe things will
be even better in the future.

483
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,600
For sure.

484
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,920
Dr. Tong.

485
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,040
Yeah, Dr. Tong.

486
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
Then, in the future,

487
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
if we're ill,

488
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,240
we will turn to Dr. Tong for help.

489
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,480
She's already helped you a lot now.

490
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,960
But I hope that everyone will be healthy

491
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,480
and nobody will visit our hospital.

492
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,160
Well said.

493
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,360
Another toast to our health.

494
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,480
Cheers.

495
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,320
You're already drinking.

496
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,720
Come on.

497
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,880
- Hurry up.
- We're waiting for you.

498
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,240
Come on.

499
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
We've been waiting for you for so long.

500
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
I received a task at work
at the last minute

501
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,600
so I'm late.

502
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm so sorry.

503
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,160
Okay.

504
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,240
If there's nothing else, you can return.

505
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,720
Okay.

506
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,880
Wait.

507
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
Let him eat with us too.

508
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,400
It's okay. Let's eat.

509
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,480
But you asked him to come here.

510
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,360
Chunsheng,

511
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
good news for you.

512
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,440
You got accepted
into the Anti-smuggling Squad.

513
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,560
We will be colleagues from now on.

514
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,280
Good news.

515
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
Chunsheng,
although you didn't choose my job offer,

516
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,160
I still have to congratulate you.

517
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,120
What he chooses is his own business.

518
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,600
Yes.

519
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Okay. Hongjun,

520
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,800
I'd appreciate your help in the future.

521
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
You're too kind.

522
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Come on.

523
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,720
Let me raise a toast.

524
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Let's congratulate Chunsheng on
being accepted into the Anti-smuggling Squad,

525
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,760
okay?

526
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,560
Cheers.

527
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
Thank you.

528
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,840
Don't drink too much.

529
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,320
Are you okay?

530
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
Don't drink too much.

531
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,800
Come on.

532
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,960
This toast

533
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,720
is to congratulate the newlyweds,
Yanqiu and Tian.

534
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
May you hold each other's hand forever

535
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,720
and have a baby soon.

536
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,920
Thank you, Chunsheng. Thank you.

537
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,280
This is exactly what I want to hear.

538
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
- Come on.
- Cheers.

539
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,720
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

540
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,500
(Unit One)

541
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,460
(Office of the Anti-smuggling Squad)

542
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,720
That's strange.

543
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
It's getting late,

544
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,480
where did everyone go?

545
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,160
Housing is being allotted these days.

546
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,920
They all went to check
the points and ranking.

547
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,240
I just checked,
Mr. Chen is not here either.

548
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,320
Did he go as well?

549
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,400
He's in charge of this.

550
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,520
This is too much!

551
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
They have to work it out for me
no matter what!

552
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Calm down.

553
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,600
Have a seat.

554
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,920
What's up?

555
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Don't ask.

556
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm afraid that he didn't get housing.

557
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,080
I don't want to have it.

558
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,200
Okay, calm down.

559
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,720
Don't be angry.

560
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,280
That's infuriating.

561
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,680
Calm down.

562
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,400
Calm down.

563
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,440
Hello, Chunsheng.

564
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
Hello, Hongjun.

565
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,360
Sit down, please.

566
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,880
Come on.

567
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,920
Have some tea.

568
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,840
Here you are.

569
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,200
It's hot. Be careful.

570
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
How's it going?

571
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
How's your work recently?

572
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,720
It's good. Don't worry.

573
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,480
What about you?

574
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
You must be busy.

575
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,880
I heard that you're in charge

576
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
of the housing allotment too.

577
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Exactly.

578
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,280
However, even if I'm busy,

579
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,920
I still have to see you
when you ask me to.

580
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,680
I have a favor to ask.

581
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,840
A favor to ask?

582
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,840
I mean,

583
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
you can ask me for a favor at home

584
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,600
or during a phone call.

585
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,440
Why did you invite me to dinner?

586
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,120
After only working for a few days here,

587
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,680
you've mastered

588
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,080
the unnecessary formalities, haven't you?

589
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
Don't tease me.

590
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,480
Actually, it's not about me.

591
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,160
It's about a brother in the Squad.

592
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,720
Well,

593
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,840
there are so many people in the Squad.

594
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
Are they all your brothers?

595
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
Tell me

596
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,080
about it now.

597
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
There's a senior colleague

598
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,200
named Cao Biao.

599
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,480
Does the name ring a bell?

600
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,640
He's from Shandong

601
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,720
and he's a veteran too.

602
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,680
Yes.

603
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,200
He's a very honest man.

604
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
There are three elderly people

605
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,160
and three kids in his family.

606
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,400
And they live in a two-room apartment.

607
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,240
That's too small.

608
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,720
His length of service
has met the criteria.

609
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
Why didn't he
get housing again this time?

610
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,440
Hongjun,

611
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,960
you're in charge of the allotment.

612
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,560
You must know the reason.

613
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,720
I know.

614
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
What criterion didn't he meet?

615
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
He has met all the criteria.

616
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,840
Then what's the reason?

617
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
You're new here,

618
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,480
there are lots of things you don't know,

619
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Chunsheng.

620
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,600
Cheers.

621
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,280
Do you know the Deputy Director, Mr. Xue?

622
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
I remember him.

623
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
He's tall

624
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,440
and has an imposing manner.

625
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Xue

626
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,720
used to be Cao Biao's
immediate supervisor.

627
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
Then for some reason,

628
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,600
they fell out.

629
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,280
Cao Biao often complains
about Xue's malpractices

630
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
to the General Administration.

631
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,360
That's how they became enemies.

632
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,200
That's it?

633
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,840
Later,

634
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
Xue came to see me and suggested

635
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,960
that I shouldn't allot housing to Cao Biao.

636
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Isn't this abusing public power
to retaliate against a personal enemy?

637
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,680
Some people are just this dishonorable.

638
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,040
He's my superior,

639
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,080
so I can't pretend that I don't understand it.

640
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
Think about it.

641
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,200
He's so narrow-minded.

642
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,840
If I offend him,

643
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,760
then he won't spare me.

644
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,960
It's hard to deal with
despicable people like him.

645
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
Then Cao Biao deserves no housing?

646
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,240
Well,

647
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,040
Chunsheng,

648
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,080
it's very likely

649
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,360
that Xue will be transferred
to the Trade Union next year.

650
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,480
After he leaves,

651
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
when we allot housing again,

652
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,080
I'll give Cao Biao housing first.

653
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Is this okay?

654
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
It's okay,

655
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
but I find it a bit infuriating.

656
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,040
How can Xue be such a big bully?

657
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,360
Isn't this malpractice?

658
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,320
Listen,

659
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,080
there must be some truth

660
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
in what Cao Biao has complained about.

661
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Well, Chunsheng,

662
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,680
there are lots of things like this.

663
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
It's out of our capacity.

664
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,760
We're against malpractice,

665
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
we have more work to do
and a long way to go.

666
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
However, we can't act rashly.

667
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,960
If the unity is undermined,

668
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
then our work will be harder.

669
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Don't you think so?

670
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,160
Yeah.

671
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
Hongjun, what you said is right.

672
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Come on.

673
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,080
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

674
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,720
Chunsheng,

675
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,080
if there's nothing else,

676
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,240
then I have to go now.

677
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
Director Shao asked me

678
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,080
to have dinner with the senior officials
of the Foreign Trade Bureau.

679
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,600
When you asked me to come,

680
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,760
I told them that
there was an emergency at home.

681
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,360
But they said

682
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
that no matter how late it is,

683
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,600
I have to come.

684
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,080
Hongjun, go ahead then.

685
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
Don't let me get in the way of your work.

686
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
Okay, Chunsheng, goodbye.

687
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,080
Goodbye.

688
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,200
Bye.

689
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Such a big meal today.

690
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
You must be in a good mood.

691
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,760
What happened?

692
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Nothing.

693
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,360
Were you in trouble at work?

694
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I don't know

695
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
what I can do with Chunsheng.

696
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,960
What on earth has happened?

697
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,040
There's a guy named Cao Biao

698
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,880
in the Anti-smuggling Squad

699
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,280
who has offended Mr. Xue.

700
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,560
Xue

701
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,320
made things hard for Cao

702
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,160
and didn't allot housing
to him this time.

703
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,080
Chunsheng came to see me for this.

704
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,040
I said that I knew it,

705
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,560
but there was nothing I could do.

706
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,400
Xue has the support of the leaders,

707
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
and he's notorious
for being narrow-minded.

708
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,360
It's not worth it for me to offend him,

709
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,560
right?

710
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,600
Anyway, Xue

711
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,000
will be transferred
to the Trade Union next year.

712
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,200
After he leaves,

713
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,160
it's very likely that I'll be his successor.

714
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,760
At that time, I will allot housing

715
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,840
to Cao Biao for sure.

716
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,080
I thought Chunsheng had agreed with this.

717
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,240
But guess what?

718
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
Chunsheng called me at noon

719
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
and asked me to eat

720
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,600
in the Sichuan restaurant
near our workplace.

721
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,560
I went there and found

722
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
that Xue was there too.

723
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,200
Shortly afterwards, Cao Biao arrived too

724
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,560
and Xue was stunned.

725
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,760
Then Chunsheng said something very blunt

726
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,840
to Xue in front of me.

727
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,600
He said

728
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,840
that there were rumors out there

729
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,040
that Xue and Cao

730
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,280
had problems,

731
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,480
and that was why Xue
retaliated against Cao.

732
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He asked Xue if this was the case.

733
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,240
Xue's face clouded over with anger
after hearing that.

734
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,440
Chunsheng didn't care about this at all

735
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,240
and he asked Xue to make
his attitude clear on the spot.

736
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,000
He said

737
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'd told him

738
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,400
that Cao Biao had met the criteria
for housing allotment

739
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,680
and asked about Xue's opinion.

740
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,520
Now that he had said this,

741
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
I had to support Chunsheng

742
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,840
even if it was hard for me.

743
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,200
Guess what?

744
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,400
Xue said

745
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,400
that as long as I agreed,

746
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Cao could get housing.

747
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,800
He said that
we didn't even need to ask him.

748
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,120
Oh no.

749
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,120
I knew it immediately

750
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
that Xue would blame this on me.

751
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,560
Later, Xue left

752
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,920
after having a drink.

753
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
He must have been angry.

754
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,720
I asked Chunsheng

755
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,920
why he had to make it so straightforward

756
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,320
without discussing it with me.

757
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,000
I also told him to stay away
from things like this in the future

758
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,440
because he'd offend people.

759
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Guess what he said?

760
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,400
Chunsheng said

761
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,800
people like Xue deserved to be offended.

762
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,040
What can I say then?

763
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,680
For the whole afternoon, I was thinking

764
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,800
about how to make amends.

765
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,080
Shortly before getting off work,

766
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
I went to Xue's office.

767
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,920
I told him

768
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,440
that Xiao Chunsheng came up

769
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
with this idea on his own.

770
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,880
I said this was the way he is,

771
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,640
please don't take it personally.

772
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,960
But Xue didn't believe me at all.

773
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,160
He said sarcastically

774
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
that no subordinates would threaten

775
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
their superiors without approval.

776
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
He also said that everyone knows
Chunsheng is my friend,

777
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
we three

778
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
set a trap for him

779
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,560
and I was just shifting the blame.

780
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,800
Of course he wouldn't believe it.

781
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
He also claimed

782
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,000
that I was so anxious

783
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
to take over his job.

784
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,400
Fang,

785
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,480
I've totally offended Xue.

786
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,480
Wait and see.

787
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,040
I wonder how
he will take revenge in the future.

788
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Every day

789
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm very cautious,

790
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
yet I somehow got an enemy.

791
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,880
That's so infuriating.

792
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,680
But what can I do?

793
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,080
Who can I blame?

794
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,640
I can't blame Chunsheng, can I?

795
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,160
However, Chunsheng is indeed wrong.

796
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,800
We're adults

797
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,280
and have jobs now.

798
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,080
We have to adapt.

799
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,520
At work,

800
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,760
on paper, I'm his superior,

801
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,880
however, he just does everything

802
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,320
in a straightforward manner
without discussing it with me.

803
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,920
And I can't even criticize him.

804
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,360
Am I right?

805
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,440
Am I right, darling?

806
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,000
What?

807
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,640
So you didn't listen to me?

808
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,320
I mean, the matter I just talked about.

809
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,560
Of course

810
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,920
Xiao Chunsheng is right.

811
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,040
That Mr. Xue abused public power

812
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,480
to retaliate against his colleague.

813
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,440
We should fight against people like him,
shouldn't we?

814
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,400
Yes, we should.

815
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,760
But we also need to be tactical.

816
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
What Chunsheng did was not clever.

817
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,760
Isn't this what Xiao Chunsheng
always does?

818
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Hongjun, is today
the first day you know him?

819
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,560
I know the way he is like.

820
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,360
However, people have to change

821
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,040
to adapt to a new environment

822
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,200
and new rules, right?

823
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,800
But what if he just doesn't change?

824
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
You want him to change.

825
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
Then, let me ask you a question.

826
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
When you were determined

827
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,320
to recruit him
to the Anti-smuggling Squad

828
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,680
to be your colleague
despite my objection,

829
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,400
had it ever occurred to you

830
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
that the way he does things
would make you unhappy?

831
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,040
Had it ever occurred to you
that he might not change?

832
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,480
Had it?

833
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,360
No!

834
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,670
But it had occurred to me.

835
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,190
That's why I was against it then.

836
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,760
I was afraid that in the end,
you two might fall out.

837
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,880
Well... You made it

838
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,320
sound worse than it actually is.

839
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,710
Actually, it doesn't matter that much.

840
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,440
I can't blame Chunsheng for it.

841
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,960
Of course not.

842
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,960
If Xue wants to take revenge,

843
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,400
then whatever.

844
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,880
Darling,

845
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,670
Chunsheng and I are brothers.

846
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,120
Brothers for life.

847
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,840
No matter whether he changes or not.

848
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,520
I just said this today

849
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,320
because you mentioned this topic.

850
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,920
Anyway,

851
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,630
let's eat.

852
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,800
Really?

853
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
That's good.

854
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,720
(What Ye Fang said
made Chen Hongjun speechless.)

855
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,040
(He was ashamed)

856
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
(and also a bit jealous.)

857
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,760
(Why did Ye Fang start
to admire Xiao Chunsheng too?)

858
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
(And Xiao Chunsheng had no idea)

859
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,200
(at that time)

860
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,920
(that Chen Hongjun, the yes-man,)

861
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
(was getting more
and more unhappy with him.)

862
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,240
(Xiao Chunsheng is a natural leader.)

863
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,000
(He's good at his job
and popular with people.)

864
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,440
(After a while,
others all think of him highly.)

865
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,040
(And Chen Hongjun
gradually became less important)

866
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,800
(during dinners.)

867
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,720
(After a long time,)

868
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,200
(Xiao Chunsheng finally got to know)

869
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,640
(that although Chen Hongjun
was talking cheerfully)

870
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,800
(during dinners like this at that time,)

871
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,440
(he actually felt
very uncomfortable inside.)

872
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,880
Come on,

873
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,520
let's drink.

874
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Cheers.

875
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Here's to Mr. Chen.

876
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,600
- Come on.
- No,

877
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,800
let's raise a toast to Chunsheng.

878
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,620
(New Year)

879
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,380
(Full of Blessings)

880
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,900
(Every year there's enough to spare)

881
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
It's cold outside.

882
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,400
Xiaomei,

883
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,240
do you think they will come?

884
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,400
You and Guohua have been good friends
for so many years.

885
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
Of course you are still good friends.

886
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,920
Xiaohui,

887
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
leave it to me.

888
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,520
Or your clothes will be dirty.

889
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
Have a rest.

890
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,160
Don't worry, Yanqiu.

891
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,400
This outfit doesn't cost much.

892
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
I'll bring you some nice clothes later.

893
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,720
Please don't.

894
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
The clothes you gave me
last time are so nice

895
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,200
that I haven't even worn them.

896
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,440
It will be a waste.

897
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,800
No. You look good in them.

898
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,320
Where is Chunsheng?

899
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,080
He said he'd make dumplings, didn't he?

900
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,880
Don't you know it?

901
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Big news.

902
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,720
Just say it.

903
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,680
Ye Guohua and He Hongling will come back.

904
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,320
Chunsheng is waiting for them outside.

905
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
These two?

906
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,040
Many years have passed.

907
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,920
Are they married?

908
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,880
No.

909
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,880
But they said
they'd have their wedding here this time.

910
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,280
I don't know.

911
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,760
They two are getting married?

912
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Okay.

913
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
I wish them luck.

914
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,000
What are you talking about?

915
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,040
They're a nice couple.

916
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Watch your words.

917
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,040
Here you are.

918
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,120
You brought me a scarf

919
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,760
yet you're not wearing one yourself.

920
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,040
I'm not cold.

921
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,080
Don't catch a cold.

922
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Well, I won't wait any longer.

923
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,520
Let's go back.

924
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,600
Hello. Are you Commander Xiao Chunsheng?

925
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,360
I'm Xiao Chunsheng,

926
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,240
but I'm not a commander.

927
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm the guard of Commander Ye,

928
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,840
and he asked me to bring you these gifts.

929
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Then where is he?

930
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,600
He asked me to tell you

931
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,000
that he'd go to his parents' place today.

932
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,520
He'd come to see you tomorrow
on Chinese New Year's Day.

933
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,680
But he asked me
to deliver these gifts beforehand

934
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,080
for you to enjoy the New Year.

935
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
These are all excellent items.

936
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,680
I'll take them inside for you now.

937
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,160
Thank you.

938
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,880
You're welcome.

939
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
So he won't come in the end.

940
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,880
Don't stay here. Go home.

941
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,400
This... This leather jacket
is extraordinary.

942
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,240
Look.

943
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,240
Yanqiu, is this for us two?

944
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,600
Look.

945
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,240
This is not something

946
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,800
ordinary people like us can get.

947
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,880
You get excited too easily.

948
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,040
Maybe Yanqiu doesn't know this,
but you should know it.

949
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,120
When we were doing trade,

950
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,880
the containers at the dock
were full of things like this.

951
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
There were too many of them

952
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,280
and we didn't even pay attention.

953
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,920
Why do you consider it
something good now?

954
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,240
I mean,

955
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,680
my eyesight is bad.

956
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,920
Is your eyesight bad too?

957
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,120
Do you think this is good?

958
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,640
So you don't like

959
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,800
the good things I bought for you?

960
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,280
My eyesight is good.

961
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,960
However, someone always

962
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
picks rustic clothes for me.

963
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,480
Today is Chinese New Year's Eve.

964
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,600
That's enough.

965
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,440
I look down on Ye Guohua for a reason.

966
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,720
He's a Deputy Battalion Commander now,

967
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,920
but his behavior hasn't changed.

968
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,720
Tian, that's unfair.

969
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,880
Today is Chinese New Year's Eve.

970
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,720
Guohua hasn't been home for a long time

971
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,720
and it's understandable
that he will visit his parents first with Hongling.

972
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,080
We're not talking about the same thing.

973
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,640
Hongling,

974
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
we're finally getting married.

975
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Aren't you happy?

976
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,520
Of course I am.

977
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm happy too.

978
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,700
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

979
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,680
Why are you here so late?

980
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,200
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

981
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,160
Hongling, let me have a look at you.

982
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,040
I haven't seen you for many years.

983
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,680
The last time you returned to Beijing

984
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,720
was when your mother was ill, right?

985
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,120
How's she now?

986
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,080
Is she okay?

987
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
She's doing well now.

988
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,080
Brother Tian.

989
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Well,

990
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
you're a Deputy Battalion Commander now.
Don't call me brother.

991
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
You're always my brother.

992
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,320
Guohua!

993
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,760
Chunsheng!

994
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
You're finally back.

995
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,520
You have recovered?

996
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,040
I told you that you'd be fine!

997
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,240
You've been prophetic since childhood.

998
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,720
