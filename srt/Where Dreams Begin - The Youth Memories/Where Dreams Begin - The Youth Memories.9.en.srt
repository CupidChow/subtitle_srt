3
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,400
Chunsheng,

4
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,720
I now admit that

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
I lost to you.

6
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,080
Are we still brothers?

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Of course.

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Get back to your work!

9
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,640
We're working for your
future mother-in-law.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,560
You're the main force.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,280
Guohua,

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,440
thanks.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,720
Big deal.

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Add some water.

15
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Have some pear soup.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Dongzi, Hongjun, come on.

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,960
Thank you, guys.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,070
Take a break and have some pear soup.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,720
Hongling,

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,720
didn't Guohua say he could ask

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,600
Professor Su to schedule surgery for me?

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
The doctor said,

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
given your situation,

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
we could choose conservative treatment

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,720
if you took medicine and
did follow-up checks on time.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,400
Why don't you call Guohua and ask him

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
to consult with Professor Su?

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,040
He's only an acquaintance of mine.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
I don't want to bother him.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Do you have a problem with him again?

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,640
Mom,

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,640
I already have a boyfriend.

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,920
Is that Chunsheng?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,920
I hear that

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,280
his father is still
under isolated review.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,040
His problem hasn't been clarified yet.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,240
Mom, don't be so snobbish, OK?

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,120
How can you say that to your mom?

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm sad.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't you know

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
what a life we've had over the years?

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,840
Do you think it's easy for me
to bring you up?

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
Sorry, Mom.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,040
I shouldn't have said that to you.

46
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Don't be angry.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,000
Mom only wants the best for you.

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
You're young

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,600
and you only think about love.

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,200
When you get married,

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
you'll know how hard life is.

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,040
I know what you mean.

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
But I can't betray my heart.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,240
Silly girl. Why are you so silly?

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
He Hongling, a call for you.

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,200
OK.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Mom, Chunsheng will be here soon.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,960
Be careful with what you say.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Hello.

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,310
Hongling, it's me.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,550
Guohua, what's up?

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Are you going to take your mom
out of the hospital?

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,720
Yes.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,080
Hongling, I've contacted Professor Su.

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,080
He'll schedule the surgery.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,360
Guohua, thanks.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
But...

68
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Hongling,

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
I've made it clear with Chunsheng.

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
No offense.

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
I just want to help you as a friend.

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
To tell the truth,

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,720
I know you mean well.

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
But I just can't accept your help

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
for granted.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Do you understand?

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Don't think too much.

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,280
I have to go.

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,900
(Unit One)

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
Guys,

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,840
listen to me.

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
For the sake of our
revolutionary friendship,

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,520
I've used up all my meat coupons

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
to treat you guys.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
I have to eat grass from now on.

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,040
Really?

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
Don't laugh. I'm telling you,

88
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
I won't stand any of you
acting courtesy today.

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
- We won't do that.
- Enjoy yourselves.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Cheers.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,360
Thanks for your treat.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Cheers.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
We may not get another treat again.

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,920
Cheers.

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,640
Next, I propose us to

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,640
drink to Comrade He Hongling.

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Congratulations to Hongling
on her glorious enlistment.

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

99
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,480
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
- Thanks, guys.
- Congratulations, Hongling.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,840
I'll empty it.

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,320
Guys,

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
I've received my call-up notice, too.

104
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
I'll join the military with Hongling
in a few days.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,160
Chunsheng, I didn't keep my promise.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Don't say that.

107
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
It's a good thing.

108
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
You should do it early.

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,480
I thought we would

110
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
never be parted.

111
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
I don't want to leave you guys,

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,200
and you.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,840
A fine man is ambitious.

114
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
A good friendship will last.

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,640
Yeah!

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
I propose again

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,800
to raise our glasses

118
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,440
and congratulate Guohua and Hongling
on their glorious enlistment.

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

120
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Cheers.

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Bottoms up!

122
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
You're enlisted.

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I'll give you a small gift

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
as a souvenir.

125
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
This pen was left by Chunsheng's mom.

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,640
It's an American product
seized on the Northeast battlefield.

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Though it's old,

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,400
it's handy.

129
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,120
Mr. Xiao, I can't accept it.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,200
It's too precious.

131
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't accept it.

132
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
During the days when I was ill,

133
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,920
thanks for looking after me.

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,680
Take it, child.

135
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,000
Write to Chunsheng more
when you get time.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
He's lonely

137
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,760
to be left home alone.

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,920
Work hard when you join the military,

139
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,840
Comrade He Hongling.

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
Yes, sir!

141
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,900
(Beijing Railway Station)

142
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,760
Guohua, do well in the military.

143
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
Rest assured. I won't disgrace you.

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Chunsheng, join us earlier.

145
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,240
They are not going to leave forever.

146
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,160
Big deal.

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,960
She's so indifferent.

148
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
She doesn't have
any revolutionary emotions.

149
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,080
Enough.

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Don't fuss.

151
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Be good to Hongjun after I leave.

152
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,320
Be gentle with him.

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,240
Don't always order him around.

154
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
Remember my words.

155
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,520
What words?

156
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,320
You tell me.

157
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Alright.

158
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,840
I remember.

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Remember to write to me.

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,320
One letter a day.

161
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,240
Don't think of other girls.

162
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes. Ma'am.

163
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,920
You'll find the right one eventually.

164
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,280
You, too.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Get on.

166
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,450
Bye.

167
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,600
Write to me.

168
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,520
Take care.

169
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
Bye.

170
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,160
Go ahead.

171
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,040
Bye, Chunsheng.

172
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,770
- Take care.
- Write to me when you arrive.

173
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,080
Take care.

174
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,420
OK.

175
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,320
Remember to think of me.

176
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,500
(Hard work is our
intrinsic political quality)

177
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,940
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

178
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
(Imperialism and all reactionaries
are paper tigers)

179
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,860
(Our native land must not be infringed
Strive to build a strong navy)

180
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll wait for you to join me in the army.

181
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,400
We've got a deal.

182
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's make our dreams
come true together.

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,400
You gave up the chance of
joining the art troupe to He Hongling

184
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
to help them,

185
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,200
not expecting to
separate them by mistake.

186
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,320
He Hongling knew Xiao Chunsheng
hadn't passed the political appraisal,

187
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,520
but she still chose to leave.

188
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
Do you know why?

189
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Neither my brother nor Xiao Chunsheng

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,920
can influence

191
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
her inner desires.

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Deep down in her heart,
she loves herself the most.

193
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,440
I was only pessimistic about
her being with my brother before,

194
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,560
but now I'm also pessimistic
about her and Xiao Chunsheng.

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
With every choice she makes,

196
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,720
she pushes Xiao Chunsheng
further away.

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,840
Xiao Chunsheng is clever.

198
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Gradually, he'll understand

199
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
he can't give He Hongling
the life she wants.

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,520
Xiaomei, I think

201
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,680
you're the same kind of person
as Xiao Chunsheng.

202
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
Do you also...

203
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
I'll bring you some fruit.

204
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
Xiao Chunsheng,

205
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,080
a letter for you.

206
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,800
When I'm writing this letter,

207
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
I haven't received
your first letter yet.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,680
Yunnan is really far away from Beijing.

209
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,320
Though the training for new recruits
is tough,

210
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I feel full of vigor every day.

211
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
I just don't feel tired.

212
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm doing well.

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,640
What about you?

214
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,840
How are you doing?

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,560
By the way,

216
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,680
last night, I dreamed about us

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
taking your dad to climb the mountain.

218
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,320
I woke up in the middle of the night

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,400
and suddenly, I missed you so much.

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,280
Xiaomei.

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,680
Mr. Xiao's blood pressure is stable.

222
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
And he's recovering well.

223
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,000
Sorry to bother you.

224
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Don't say that.

225
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,760
It's my pleasure.

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
Sit down.

227
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,960
Have some water.

228
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
Chunsheng, have you
read the newspaper recently?

229
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
Since the Gang of Four was smashed,

230
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
gratifying changes have taken place
in all walks of life.

231
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,000
All industries are thriving like
bamboo shoots after rain.

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,520
Society has taken on
an altogether new aspect.

233
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,520
Times have changed.

234
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
You should pull yourself together

235
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
and be more concerned
about this changing world.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
Hongling, I've thought it over.

237
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Young people should go out

238
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,040
to embrace the changing world.

239
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,840
You know I've always regarded

240
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
joining the military as my life goal.

241
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Though I can't fulfill the wish now,

242
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,400
I won't give up.

243
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
But when I'm waiting,

244
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
I shouldn't sit at home.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Maybe I should hunt for a job.

246
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,600
Chunsheng, I agree with you.

247
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm looking forward to meeting you
in the military camp,

248
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,720
but I also hope
you have a fulfilling life.

249
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,400
I believe wherever you are,

250
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
(Glorious tradition of plain living
and hard struggle) you will shine

251
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
and make an achievement.

252
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,240
But don't push yourself too hard.

253
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,560
Today, the leaders came to

254
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,280
pick players for the greeting
performance for the new recruits.

255
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
(Develop literary and art activities)
I was trembling with nervousness.

256
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,860
(To consolidate the socialist
ideological and cultural front)

257
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,760
But the result is good.

258
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,480
Chunsheng, it's the magazine
Guohua mailed to you.

259
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,400
And a letter.

260
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,920
Thanks, Mr. Niu.

261
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,320
Bye.

262
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,960
OK.

263
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,940
(Develop economy)

264
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
You know,

265
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,480
people who come here
are all our regular customers.

266
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,960
Smile at them more.

267
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,520
You have a bright smile.

268
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,000
This is the candy section.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
Later on, you...

270
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
You stay here.

271
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Get acquainted with the business.

272
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,760
That's the vegetable
and raw food section.

273
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,040
The vegetables are delivered at 5 a.m.

274
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
Look here.

275
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
Daily necessities section.

276
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,840
Be careful!

277
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Mr. Liu.

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,000
Are you OK?

279
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,520
My back hurts so much.

280
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,520
Here.

281
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
Liu, what's wrong with you?

282
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,920
Where do I put it?

283
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
On the shelf over there.

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,480
OK.

285
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,040
Here.

286
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
Who is he?

287
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,160
A new comer.

288
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,280
My apprentice.

289
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,120
Really?

290
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,200
You have a good apprentice.

291
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,440
He can take a hint and he's strong.

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,160
He works efficiently.

293
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,520
Also, he's good-looking.

294
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,200
What?

295
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,080
He only carried a pig for you.

296
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,440
Do you have to flatter him?

297
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
I have a great eye for good men.

298
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,400
Yuan Fang,

299
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,560
isn't this young man suitable?

300
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,680
For what?

301
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,840
For you.

302
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
You haven't found the right man
after several consecutive blind dates.

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
My wife is anxious to look for

304
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
the right person for you.

305
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,520
He turns out to be
right in front of you.

306
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,400
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

307
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,080
- What?
- What are you talking about?

308
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Is there a ban on
master-apprentice relationship?

309
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,520
I'll just ignore you.

310
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
My back.

311
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,280
Hongling,

312
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,920
let me give you a hand.

313
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
Thanks, but I'm almost done.

314
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
Let me help you to wring it out.

315
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,520
So,

316
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,760
have you adapted to life here?

317
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,000
Sure.

318
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,840
I have rehearsals and
performances every day.

319
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,870
Life is busy but fulfilling.

320
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,870
What about you?

321
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,390
The training of the field forces

322
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,840
is much tougher than the art troupe.

323
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,630
We do 5 km
cross-country running frequently.

324
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,320
Fortunately,

325
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,110
I'm cut out for a soldier.

326
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,760
The hard training is nothing to me.

327
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,840
Hongling,

328
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
we all know

329
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
Ye Guohua

330
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,280
is a nice man.

331
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
You know each other so well.

332
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,080
Are you also from the military compound?

333
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,000
Give me.

334
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,700
(State-run Grocery)

335
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,920
Look.

336
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,000
Look.

337
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Prop it open.

338
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,400
Give me.

339
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Chunsheng, take a break.

340
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
I'll treat you to a movie tonight.

341
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,440
Sorry. Master.

342
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
I have a date with my girlfriend.

343
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
Do you have a girlfriend?

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,600
OK.

345
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,480
I'll go first.

346
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,240
Remember to lock the door.

347
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
OK. Rest assured.

348
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,280
Master, any instructions today?

349
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,600
No instructions.

350
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,120
Watch your counter.

351
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,360
Cap, why are you here?

352
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,760
Heizi let me tell you
he wants to see you tonight.

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Where?

354
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,280
His house.

355
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
OK. Got it.

356
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,680
Gotta go.

357
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,120
OK.

358
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,640
Chunsheng.

359
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Who is he?

360
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,240
A friend of mine.

361
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,000
He looks like a typical rascal.

362
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,160
I'm telling you,

363
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,760
don't fraternize with the rascals.

364
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,440
You mustn't make trouble for

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
our supply and marketing cooperative.

366
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,520
Master, don't worry.

367
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,400
Have some more, Li.

368
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,920
Li.

369
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,520
Cheers.

370
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,560
You're having dinner.

371
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,760
Chunsheng.

372
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
Why are you here?

373
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,360
Why can't I be here?

374
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Forget about the old misunderstanding.

375
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,320
Xiaohui.

376
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,200
What's wrong with your face?

377
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,760
I...

378
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,200
She was clumsy and fell.

379
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,440
Get back to your work.

380
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,200
Go ahead.

381
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
OK. You guys talk.

382
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,240
Sit down.

383
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,400
Would you like a drink?

384
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,840
Heizi,

385
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
go ahead. What can I do for you?

386
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,040
Well, Chunsheng,

387
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,360
I invited you over

388
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,240
to talk about a business deal.

389
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
What business?

390
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,680
You know,

391
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
I used to smuggle things

392
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,880
with Tian.

393
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
Now that he's been put behind bars

394
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
and sentenced,

395
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,000
I no longer have a business to do.

396
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,520
But I still have to make a living.

397
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,440
So lately, I've been discussing with Li

398
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,560
about making a profit
by flipping some commodities.

399
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,440
You're said to work in a
supply and marketing cooperative now.

400
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,440
Look, Chunsheng,

401
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
if you smuggle

402
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,360
some popular commodities

403
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,640
from the cooperative,

404
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,880
we can sell them
for a higher price outside.

405
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,960
When the business is done,

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,120
we'll split the profit, OK?

407
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,120
Heizi, what are you thinking?

408
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,080
The commodities in the cooperative
are all supplied by coupons.

409
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
And their purchase and marketing
are monopolized.

410
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm just a little employee.

411
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,440
I don't have the ability
to smuggle things out.

412
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,840
You'll get me sacked.

413
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,560
Look, take it easy.

414
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,320
Let's discuss it, Chunsheng.

415
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,000
Stop.

416
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,480
There's nothing to discuss.

417
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,880
Chunsheng.

418
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,280
Chunsheng.

419
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,840
I'll go.

420
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
Xiaohui.

421
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
It's cold today.

422
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,880
Let me warm you up.

423
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,720
What are you doing?

424
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,040
I care about you.

425
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm telling you,

426
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
don't piss me off, or I'll tell Heizi.

427
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,280
Go tell him.

428
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
If you tell him,

429
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,720
I'll tell him that

430
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,240
you seduced me first.

431
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Don't forget,

432
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,840
you're a little slut in his mind.

433
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Let's see if he believes you or me.

434
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,160
It smells so good.

435
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,440
Do you use Youyi Vanishing Cream?

436
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,320
Ye Fang's family gives me food

437
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,320
and buys me clothes.

438
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,240
Ye Fang even gives me pocket money.

439
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,200
I don't see why you're complaining.

440
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,920
I know I may sound a little ungrateful.

441
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
But I really don't like it.

442
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,480
Chunsheng,

443
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,320
I feel like I'm living off a woman

444
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,480
and I'm getting used to it.

445
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,360
You know what,

446
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,240
people in a relationship or marriage
help each other.

447
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,360
Now Fang is supporting you.

448
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
When you're enrolled in college
and have a promising future,

449
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,640
you can support Fang.

450
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,240
Chunsheng.

451
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,440
Do you think

452
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,680
the college entrance examination
will be resumed?

453
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,240
What do you think?

454
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,640
Ye Fang has been mysterious lately.

455
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,160
She said the political climate
would change soon

456
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,960
and the examination would be resumed.

457
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,520
She drags me to the library every day.

458
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,760
I have to use my mother's illness
as an excuse

459
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,720
to go home and do housework.

460
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,080
I think it's ridiculous.

461
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Don't worry.

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,240
Be patient.

463
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,760
I think Fang

464
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,080
is right about this.

465
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
You are the only one
who believes her,

466
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,760
yet she makes up various excuses
to stop me from

467
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,800
hanging out with you.

468
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
It's almost 3 p.m.

469
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,760
Well,

470
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,920
you'd better go.

471
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Don't be late.

472
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,520
You must take it seriously
since you promised to Fang.

473
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,000
But

474
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,640
I haven't finished the work yet.

475
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,960
Leave it to me.

476
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Go wash your face and get changed.

477
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,760
Don't delay your study

478
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
or Fang will reproach you again.

479
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Yeah. So...

480
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,040
Chunsheng,

481
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,280
I don't know what to say.

482
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,560
Leave it to me. Go ahead.

483
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,560
OK.

484
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
Have you learned to play
yesterday's tune?

485
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,840
Not yet.

486
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,520
I haven't, either.

487
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
Commander Huang said
I wasn't good enough.

488
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,840
- It's difficult.
- Hongling.

489
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,440
Here.

490
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,480
I made inquires, Hongling.

491
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,240
Ye Guohua contributed a lot
to your enlistment.

492
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,240
Are you a couple?

493
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,840
No, it isn't true.

494
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,840
You're both cadres' children

495
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,040
from Beijing.

496
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,960
Do you come from the same
military compound?

497
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,600
Chen Can, you're such a busybody.

498
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,960
It's common for people to have
a couple of old friends in the military.

499
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
Hongling's family background

500
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,840
is none of your business.

501
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,160
I was just asking.

502
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,640
I won't ask again if you say so.

503
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
Ignore her.

504
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,960
She always does that.

505
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,160
She has asked about

506
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,720
everyone's background on the team.

507
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,640
She's nosy.

508
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Aren't you curious?

509
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
No, I'm not.

510
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
I want to make friends with you
only if we get along well.

511
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,280
Otherwise, I won't be interested in you

512
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
even if your parents
are high-ranking officials.

513
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,800

517

(Actually, I'm not sure.
But I demand myself to be sure.)

518
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,800
(I want you)

519
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
(to believe with me the
examination will come eventually.)

520
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,320
Fang.

521
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,120
Hush.

522
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,400
(Will do.)

530
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,320
Great!

531
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Fang.

532
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,080
- Congratulations!
- Great.

Chunsheng.

534
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,240
Great!

535
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,720
Hurry.

Great.

Great.

541
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,840
Fang, you were right.

542
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,960

all new recruits can sign up for it.

If you want to give a performance,

549
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
just put it forward.

550
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,080

you can come to my office to sign up.

558

All the leaders

of the military region will come
to watch your performance.

560
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,120
It'll be helpful

561
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
for your future career.

562
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,880
You don't need me to remind you

563
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,520
how important it is.

564
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,600
Alright.

565
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,600
I hope you can pull out

566
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
your best performance.

567
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,440
Do you understand?

568
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
Yes.

569
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,840
Hongling,

570
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,080
come with me.

571
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
Why her again?

572
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,760
Yeah.

573
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,200
What does Commander
want her to do?

574
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
Why does Commander
always single her out?

575
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,880
Hongling.

576
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,880
Sit.

577
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,440
Hongling, have some water.

578
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,600
Thanks, ma'am.

579
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,040
Are your hands fine?

580
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,800
Yeah.

581
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,600
I've paid close attention to
all of you

582
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,880
since you came here.

583
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
You're the most hardworking one
among the new recruits.

584
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,360
So I'm optimistic about you

585
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,480
in this selection.

586
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Thanks, ma'am.

587
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,520
I won't disappoint you.

588
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
You have good professional skills.

589
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,160
Though you're young,

590
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,560
you're sober and outstanding.

591
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,680
Keep up the good work.

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,680
I promise to live up to your trust.

593
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,800
Prepare well when you get back.

594
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
The results will
depend on your performance.

595
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,880
This performance
is just a starting point.

596
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,800
Work harder.

597
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,280
Yes.

598
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,560
(When his sister worked overtime,)

599
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,440
(Xiao Chunsheng stayed at home
alone with his father.)

600
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
(He took the responsibility)

601
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
(of taking care of his father.)

602
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,480
(Every day after breakfast,)

603
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,240
(he left with Ye Fang and Hongjun.)

604
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,960
(He went to the cooperative)

605
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,280
(while the other two
went to the library.)

606
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,360
(Generally,)

607
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,440
(his life was busy)

608
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,240
(and fulfilling these days.)

609
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,360
Chunsheng.

610
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,120
Xiaohui.

611
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,480
You want to see me?

612
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
OK. Wait for me outside.

613
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,600
OK.

614
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,240
Master, may I leave for a minute?

615
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,760
Get back quickly.

616
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,240
I'll be back soon.

617
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,120
Xiaohui, you didn't tell me last time.

618
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,120
Did Heizi

619
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,320
hurt you?

620
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,440
It's OK.

621
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,840
What happened?

622
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,200
Why did he hit you?

623
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,360
I was training with the team that day.

624
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,720
The coach corrected my movements.

625
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,800
You know

626
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
physical contact is normal

627
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
during instruction.

628
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,710
But he wasn't happy about it.

629
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,320
He took some guys to intercept my coach.

630
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,960
I tried to stop them.

631
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,920
He might have hit me
by mistake in chaos.

632
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,000
It's OK.

633
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,120
Did he do this before?

634
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,160
No, he didn't.

635
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't know
what's wrong with him now.

636
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,520
He seems to be very jealous.

637
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
With one of his eyes injured,

638
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,190
he doesn't think he's worthy of you.

639
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,880
Actually, I know people's opinions
about me.

640
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,600
I admit I'm a vain woman.

641
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,190
I enjoy the feeling

642
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,120
of being envied by others.

643
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,960
But do you believe me?

644
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,560
I've never done anything

645
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,120
that would hurt Heizi.

646
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,120
And no matter what he becomes,

647
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,670
I won't frown upon him.

648
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,120
I believe you.

649
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,880
Thanks.

650
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
He's such a fool.

651
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,120
He is on guard against everyone,

652
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,160
but he doesn't know

653
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,520
the real goat sticks with him every day.

654
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Well,

655
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,000
what do you mean?

656
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,000
Chunsheng, that's what I came for.

657
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,200
That scumbag, Li Shangyou,

658
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
is definitely not a good guy.

659
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,320
He holds a grudge against you
for what happened before.

660
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,000
Do you know that?

661
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,360
That's why.

662
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,400
The problem is,

663
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,240
Heizi still

664
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,720
harbors resentment toward
Chen Hongjun for hurting him.

665
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
He can't let it off his mind.

666
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
And you're Chen Hongjun's protector.

667
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,720
So I'm worried.

668
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm worried that if one day, Li Shangyou

669
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,240
instigates Heizi to do

670
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,840
some radical things

671
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,120
to you and Chen Hongjun,

672
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,760
it will not only hurt you guys

673
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,840
but...

674
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
but also cause Heizi huge trouble.

675
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,000
So, Chunsheng,

676
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,080
you must be careful.

677
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,880
You must be on guard
against Li Shangyou.

678
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,240
Thanks, Xiaohui.

679
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,320
I get it.

680
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,000
Alright.

681
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,200
I've told you everything I should.

682
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
I have to go home.

683
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,560
Heizi doesn't know I'm out.

684
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,280
Xiaohui,

685
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,120
I know you truly love Heizi.

686
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,760
But nothing is

687
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
more important than yourself.

688
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,000
If you want to leave him,

689
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,560
I can help you.

690
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,280
No, no, Chunsheng.

691
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,560
Well,

692
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,560
I know what I should do.

693
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,600
Thanks.

694
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,280
Bye.

695
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,440
The other day I passed by
Mrs. Huang's office.

696
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,120
Guess what I overheard?

697
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
What? You sound so cryptic.

698
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,520
Mrs. Huang encouraged
He Hongling to sign up.

699
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,240
You know,

700
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
we have so many members
with excellent skills.

701
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,080
Why did she single her out
and encourage her?

702
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,880
Mrs. Huang promised
it would be open and fair.

703
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
Everyone can sign up.

704
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
But only your competence

705
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
can determine the result.

706
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,280
If you have time to gossip,

707
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,480
why don't you practice more?

708
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
Chunsheng,

709
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,520
the performance is coming soon.

710
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Mrs. Huang said I was her favorite
among the new recruits.

711
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,560
She encouraged me to sign up.

712
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,240
I'll work hard to pass the selection.

713
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
What have you been doing recently?

714
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,880
I miss you.

715
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
Hongling, I'm fine.

716
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,480
There's great news.

717
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,640
The college entrance examination
is finally resumed.

718
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
Ye Fang and Hongjun were so excited
that they cried.

719
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,720
(To He Hongling)
I'm happy for them.

720
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,160
But lately, Guo Heizi is fooling around

721
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,360
with Li Shangyou again.

722
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
They want to retaliate against Hongjun.

723
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Don't worry.

724
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
In this world,

725
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,240
there's nothing I can't solve.

726
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,880
I'll protect him.

727
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I miss you, too.

728
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,740
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

729
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm going to the canteen

730
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,240
to get some groceries.

731
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,960
Go ahead.

732
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,520
See you later.

733
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,080
OK.

734
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,040
I have to go.

735
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,880
Wait.

736
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,080
What's up?

737
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,160
These days,

738
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,360
you always seem nervous and preoccupied.

739
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,120
Do you have any problems?

740
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
No big deal.

741
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,400
Don't worry about it.

742
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,600
Xiao Chunsheng,

743
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,400
do you know what

744
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,040
your biggest problem is?

745
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,640
What is it?

746
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
You always like to

747
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
carry others' responsibilities
on your own shoulders.

748
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,560
The relationship between you,
my brother, and He Hongling

749
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,080
got tangled because of your concession.

750
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,040
You don't understand

751
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,440
the years of friendship

752
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
between Guohua and me.

753
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,640
Will you tell me?

754
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,320
I don't want to say much more

755
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,520
except one thing.

756
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,360
Tell Hongjun

757
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,520
to stay safe.

758
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,880
Gotta go.

759
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
By car?

760
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,440
Yeah.

761
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
To save more time for studying,

762
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,160
I asked my dad to let us

763
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,680
take his car

764
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,400
to the library from now on.

765
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,600
Is it appropriate?

766
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,840
Why isn't it appropriate?

767
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,680
Let's go.

768
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,380
(Program List of the
New Recruits Performance)

769
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Hongling, you got selected.

770
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,160
In the future, if anyone says again
you are incompetent

771
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
and only joined the troupe
through connections,

772
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,400
let's throw the program list
at their face

773
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,000
and shut them up.

774
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,440
I don't care about what they say.

775
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,120
I know well

776
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,320
about my real ability.

777
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,280
No way.

778
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,680
Kind people are always bullied.

779
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,800
You should be tough sometimes.

780
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Sure. Sure.

781
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,160
I get it.

782
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,560
Chunsheng.

783
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,600
Chunsheng.

784
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,120
Chunsheng, they're here for you.

785
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,840
Heizi,

786
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,960
they have nothing to do with this.

787
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
Let's talk outside, OK?

788
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I won't go anywhere.

789
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Let's talk here.

790
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,560
OK. Go ahead.

791
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,160
Did Xiaohui

792
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,840
come to see you?

793
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,200
Xiao Chunsheng,

794
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
a leopard can't change its spots.

795
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,600
First, it was He Hongling.

796
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,240
Now, it's Xiaohui.

797
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,400
What do you want?

798
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,720
You can't stop coveting
your brothers' women.

799
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,080
Is that some kind of habit?

800
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,760
Heizi,

801
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,760
watch your mouth.

802
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,920
Yeah, Xiaohui came to see me.

803
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,600
But she was worried about you.

804
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,880
About me?

805
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah.

806
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,400
She was worried about you.

807
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
She asked me to persuade you.

808
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,000
Heizi,

809
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,080
there's no free lunch in the world,

810
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,240
let alone ask a tiger for its skin.

811
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,080
Some people bow down to you

812
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
and cotton up to you

813
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,760
only forced by the situation.

814
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,120
If one day they get the upper hand,

815
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,520
they'll pay you back all the shit

816
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
they have taken from you.

817
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,120
Heizi, listen to me.

818
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,320
Don't be blinded by short-term benefits.

819
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
People who would do anything
for benefits

820
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,520
aren't your brothers.

821
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,400
Xiao Chunsheng, are you hinting at me?

822
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
I find that

823
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,400
you're good at fomenting dissension.

824
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,480
People like me are not brothers,

825
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,400
but you are.

826
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,480
I hear that He Hongling

827
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
is your girlfriend now.

828
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,080
Wasn't she Qi Tian's girlfriend?

829
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,000
I also heard that

830
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,760
she had a past with your good brother,

831
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,760
Ye Guohua.

832
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,640
Is that the brotherhood

833
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,720
you always boast about?

834
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,960
Li Shangyou, I'm telling you.

835
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,040
I don't have the obligation

836
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,240
to explain to you what happened

837
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,400
between Qi Tian, He Hongling,

838
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,960
Ye Guohua, and me!

839
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,760
But,

840
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,960
He Hongling has never done

841
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,320
anything wrong to Tian.

842
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,600
I know that.

843
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,040
Tian entrusted He Hongling to you

844
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,000
and asked you to take care of her.

845
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,240
Not only Hongling,

846
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,440
he entrusted

847
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,200
all of us to you.

848
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,960
I just don't understand.

849
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,000
Why are you guys

850
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,080
so self-righteous?

851
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,560
I've followed Tian for years.

852
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,880
I never called two if he called one.

853
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I never went westward
if he said eastward.

854
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,040
I never chased a chicken
if he wanted a dog.

855
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,560
I lost an eye.

856
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,240
Tian asked me to let it go. Fine.

857
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,000
I let it go.

858
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,760
A running dog
wouldn't do better than me.

859
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Then he left us.

860
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,680
You don't want us. Fine.

861
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,160
But don't give us away.

862
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,200
He entrusted us to you.

863
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,560
