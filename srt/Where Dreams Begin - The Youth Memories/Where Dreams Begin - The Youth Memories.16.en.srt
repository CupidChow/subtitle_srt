=Episode 16=

3
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,540
She no longer wants to be an onlooker.

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,940
She wants to start a fiery-colored life.

5
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,580
She wants her youth

6
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,060
to be sparkling,

7
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,580
even if it can't be remarkable.

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Xiaomei, I think you get the right idea.

9
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,500
I support you.

10
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,060
But...

11
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,940
Don't worry.

12
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,300
I'll protect myself.

13
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,500
At ease!

14
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,700
Attention!

15
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,460
Comrades, you all did a good job today.

16
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,140
You completed the training mission

17
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,020
and showed your strong will.

18
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,180
Especially the four of you,

19
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,500
Meng Jinzhu, Fang Li,

20
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,500
Duan Lei,

21
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,580
and Xiao Chunsheng.

22
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,740
Praise for their excellent performance.

23
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,580
Qian Amao often asked for sick leave.

24
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,420
But today, I didn't approve.

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,140
Because I wanted to see
how he would end up

26
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,900
after a day's training.

27
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,900
Qian Amao.

28
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,500
Sir!

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,060
Fall out.

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,620
Yes!

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,740
Are you dead?

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,420
No, sir.

33
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,380
Can you hang in there?

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,260
More or less.

35
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,980
What?

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,420
Yes, I can!

37
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,500
Fall in.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,940
Yes.

39
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,340
Remember.

40
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,900
Only when you train desperately

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,580
can you survive the war!

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,980
Am I clear?

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,980
- Yes!
- Yes!

44
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,940
Dismiss!

45
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:50,900
Here.

46
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
Guohua, no offense,

47
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,740
but your shooting fell off a lot.

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,020
Not even as good
as that in our compound.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,540
Practice makes perfect.

50
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,700
Shooting must be practiced often.

51
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,420
I've been too busy training you guys

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,900
to use my rifle even once.

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,780
It certainly fell off.

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,620
But don't worry.

55
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,100
When I was in the recruit company,

56
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,420
I was also one of the best shooters.

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,780
Give me some time for practice.

58
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,380
I'll get at least 80 points.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,820
OK.

60
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,660
Veterans of last year told me

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,220
Ye Guohua was the worst shooter.

62
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
How does he have the cheek

63
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,060
to cultivate elite snipers and scouts?

64
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,180
A burden like him

65
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,220
is even a platoon leader
of the elite squad.

66
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,420
And he said

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,340
a soldier couldn't be in the elite squad

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,940
unless he got nine points in a shot.

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,700
Bah.

70
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,220
He doesn't deserve
to be a platoon leader, I think.

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,580
All you can do is talk behind him.

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,220
Why does he not deserve it?

73
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,340
Think about his family background.

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,420
You guys,

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,260
if you have a problem,

76
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,060
talk honestly to him.

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,420
Don't gossip behind his back like this!

78
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,620
Duan Lei, Meng Jinzhu, fall out.

79
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,300
Show them how to shoot.

81
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,180
May I say something?

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,020
Yes.

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,980
I'm not the best or the second best.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,540
I'm in no position to demonstrate.

85
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,940
Comrade Meng Jinzhu,

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,580
you shoot very well, too.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,340
Be confident.

88
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,860
Sir,

89
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,820
you're the leader of the elite squad,

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,100
the best of the best.

91
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,220
We all want to see how well you shoot

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,300
and learn from you.

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,140
Please demonstrate shooting for us.

94
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,820
Sir!

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,620
I request to demonstrate shooting.

96
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,860
You're not the platoon leader.

97
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,500
Why can you demonstrate it?

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,780
This is too trivial

99
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,780
for our leader.

100
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,340
Besides,

101
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,540
Platoon Leader Ye taught me to shoot.

102
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,300
I've only learned a little,

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,140
but it's enough for you.

104
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,260
Duan Lei, Meng Jinzhu, fall in.

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,380
- Yes.
- About face!

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,860
Report target!

107
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,820
Nine shots.

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
89 points.

109
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,700
- Great!
- Great!

110
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,700
Guohua didn't shoot very well days ago.

111
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,300
I didn't want him to be looked down on.

112
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,100
Unexpectedly, with a good grounding,

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,020
Guohua improved so quickly.

114
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,740
Chunsheng,

115
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
I think it was inconsiderate of you.

116
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,220
Actually,

117
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,980
it wasn't a big deal.

118
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,700
Hongling, I know your point.

119
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,500
You told me something before.

120
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,100
And I thought carefully about it.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,460
You made sense, I think.

122
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,260
Right.

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,540
The relationship between Guohua and me

124
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,340
has indeed changed.

125
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,260
We're not only buddies,

126
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
but also superior and subordinate.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,980
I should think twice
before doing anything

128
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,260
in case I give others a handle

129
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,580
and bring trouble to Guohua.

130
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,980
But you still...

131
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,380
Hongling, actually, I...

132
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
I was rather hesitant then.

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,060
I thought for a long time, too.

134
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,220
I feared.

135
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,100
I feared standing out like that

136
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,700
would do Guohua harm.

137
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,500
Guohua is my platoon leader.

138
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,780
But he's also my best buddy.

139
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,700
If I hadn't helped him at that moment,

140
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,780
what kind of buddy could I be?

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,460
If I always hesitate,

142
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,140
I'll be distrusting Guohua.

143
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,780
He isn't that narrow-minded.

144
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,940
Hongling, you may not understand.

145
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,540
Guohua and I are real brothers.

146
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
I don't think

147
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,860
he'll drift apart with me for this.

148
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,060
Chunsheng, I still think

149
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,260
you're oversimplifying things.

150
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,660
Can it be that

151
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,380
we always think too much

152
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,140
about simple things

153
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,300
so that they get complicated?

154
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,220
I just wish the best for him.

155
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,780
But what if he doesn't think so?

156
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,820
What if no one else thinks so?

157
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,180
Back in Shichahai,

158
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,460
you didn't want Guohua to be bullied.

159
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,500
So, you had the fight against Qi Tian

160
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,340
in his name.

161
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,660
What happened, then?

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,060
Chunsheng, I know you mean well.

163
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,460
You really want to help him.

164
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,820
But others aren't foolish.

165
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,980
Hongling, this is exactly what I think.

166
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,780
Chunsheng, you're a good man
and you're capable.

167
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,740
But the problem is you're too good,

168
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,780
too capable, and too confident.

169
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
It's not that you don't
care about others,

170
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,300
but you care about everyone.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,580
In this case,

172
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,980
their business is yours, too.

173
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,940
When you do everything for them,

174
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,420
they have nothing to do.

175
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,140
But this isn't the way the world goes.

176
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,540
Everyone has to do his own business.

177
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,260
And he can depend on no one,

178
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
except himself.

179
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
But we're best buddies.

180
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,900
Just because you're best buddies,

181
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,660
you should

182
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,180
keep some distance.

183
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,380
Chunsheng, in this world,

184
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,780
not everyone can be as awesome as you.

185
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,460
If you and Guohua

186
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,900
were in the old positions

187
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,420
where you defended him

188
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,740
and he was OK to be inferior,

189
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,060
this relationship could go on.

190
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
But now, you're not in the same status.

191
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
He's in a higher position.

192
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,860
A higher position leads to more desire.

193
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,140
And he has to have a stronger desire.

194
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,900
He also wants himself to be glittering.

195
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,300
And he wants more people

196
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,380
to see his light.

197
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,700
So, at this moment,

198
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,300
you should distance yourself.

199
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,260
You can't let your light

200
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,100
obscure his.

201
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,220
OK.

202
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,980
Let me ask you something.

203
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,460
Who's the platoon leader, you or him?

204
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,500
Who convinces the soldiers, you or him?

205
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,900
After you defended him,

206
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
did you meet or talk privately?

207
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
You don't need to answer.

208
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,100
I hope you know the answers.

209
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,060
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

210
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,460
Be... Be gentle.

211
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,100
Don't ruin your shirt.

212
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,300
What are you doing?

213
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,780
Come on.

214
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,540
Can't you just wring it out?

215
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,220
Why must you shake it?

216
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,180
You have no idea.

217
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,860
In this way, the shirt will be smooth

218
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,740
and doesn't need to be ironed.

219
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,020
You even iron your shirt?

220
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,900
Sorry. I don't mean that.

221
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,940
I know.

222
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,500
You're just in a bad mood

223
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,340
and you feel upset.

224
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,780
Chunsheng, does anything bother you?

225
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,940
Bother?

226
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,380
What could bother me?

227
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,700
Actually, you're more conscious
than anyone else.

228
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,020
You just don't want to face it.

229
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
What do you mean?

230
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,700
Tell me.

231
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,580
Platoon Leader Ye

232
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,620
didn't talk to you for days, did he?

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,660
He's a platoon leader.

234
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,380
How can he talk to me every day?

235
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,420
Xiao Chunsheng,

236
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,580
you're always the bravest

237
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
in training.

238
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,660
But deep in your heart,

239
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,740
you're the most timid.

240
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,060
Fine. Be specific.

241
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,140
Why do you think I'm timid?

242
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,980
You're the most scared of losing.

243
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,580
But what kind of people can be that lucky

244
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,180
to stay together forever?

245
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,740
Some people don't suit each other

246
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,180
and they break up sooner or later.

247
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Don't keep anyone forcibly.

248
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,820
Look.

249
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,180
I met many civilized men in the army

250
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,300
and I learned quite a lot.

251
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,660
I told you what I just learned

252
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,860
and you believed that.

253
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,380
Citizens like you are really fun.

254
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,020
Come on, Qian Amao.

255
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,460
No offense,

256
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,020
but if you have free time,

257
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,340
why don't you
take care of your personal hygiene

258
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,020
and your military look?

259
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,940
That'd be the best thing to do.

260
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,820
Don't worry about others.

261
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,420
Yeah, that's right.

262
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,660
But Chunsheng,

263
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,940
I really think you're a good man.

264
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,740
If you were someone else,

265
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,140
I wouldn't interfere.

266
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,580
Sometimes, you know,

267
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,580
when I saw something,

268
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,780
I had to utter it. Or I would feel bad.

269
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,900
Come on, just get to the point, OK?

270
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,300
Based on my observations,

271
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,420
since the day

272
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,060
we had the shooting training,

273
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,660
Platoon Leader Ye had a regular talk

274
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,020
to all the other soldiers of our company.

275
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,020
He just didn't talk to you.

276
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,340
Why?

277
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,820
It's hard to learn from good examples,

278
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,060
but it's easy to learn from bad ones.

279
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,660
Qian Amao,

280
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,700
don't learn to talk behind others' backs.

281
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,780
Platoon Leader Ye has his reasons

282
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,940
for the conversation thing.

283
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,980
In the army, I'm his soldier.

284
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,900
He's my superior

285
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,860
and my leader.

286
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,060
Out of the army,

287
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
he and I are best buddies.

288
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,940
Rules are rules.

289
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,740
And best buddies don't break up.

290
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,140
I'm just saying

291
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,420
you should be alert to your buddy.

292
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,340
All right, stop.

293
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,780
I know better than anyone else

294
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,180
what man my best buddy is.

295
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,860
Fine, fine.

296
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,020
Pretend I said nothing.

297
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,260
Go on with your laundry.

298
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,380
Be seated, Chunsheng.

299
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Thank you, sir.

300
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,140
Sir,

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,860
I heard you didn't feel very well.

302
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,780
Nothing. Just a cold.

303
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,780
Chunsheng, we're here alone.

304
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,900
Make yourself at home.

305
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,660
I reflected on myself lately.

306
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,100
I didn't adjust my mentality.

307
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,700
We're now in the army,

308
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,300
but I still behave as before,

309
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,300
thinking you're my best buddy

310
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,780
and I have to take care of you.

311
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,180
Actually, it's like

312
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,460
asking for the disguised privilege.

313
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm just self-centered,

314
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,860
without consideration for anyone else.

315
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,300
Basically,

316
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm way too proud

317
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,180
and I've brought trouble to your work.

318
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,140
I...

319
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,580
I seriously reflected on myself

320
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,020
and I'll correct myself actively.

321
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,580
Chunsheng, I...

322
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,140
Sir,

323
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,100
call me Comrade Xiao Chunsheng.

324
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,940
Back in Beijing,

325
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,740
we're best buddies.

326
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,460
But here in the army,

327
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,940
you're my leader

328
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,260
and I'm your soldier.

329
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,660
I'll totally take your orders.

330
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,140
Don't be awkward.

331
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,660
Criticize and scold me

332
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,380
if necessary.

333
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,580
Only in this way

334
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,580
can I better correct myself.

335
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,620
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng!

336
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,060
Sir!

337
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,340
Work hard.

338
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,140
Yes, sir!

339
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,740
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

340
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,340
You really take him as your friend, huh?

341
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,940
I just don't like him.

342
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,940
But for your sake,

343
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,580
I wouldn't give him trouble.

344
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,740
Meng Jinzhu, tell me.

345
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,100
Why are you recruited
in the elite squad?

346
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,180
To defend our country

347
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
and become an excellent soldier.

348
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,460
Wrong.

349
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,900
Even if a soldier

350
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,140
can be really excellent,

351
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,060
how many enemies can he stop?

352
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,460
How many advanced weapons
can he ward off?

353
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,060
Not to mention a division,
a battalion, or a company,

354
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,980
he can't even stop a platoon or a squad.

355
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,540
I know all of you

356
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,540
think you're excellent soldiers.

357
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,660
But in a war,

358
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,180
a soldier is just as small as an ant.

359
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,220
However excellent or brave you are,

360
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,340
however well you can shoot,

361
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,060
fighting alone will be a rash attempt.

362
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,460
Am I right?

363
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,660
- Right.
- Yes.

364
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,460
- Right.
- Yes.

365
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,100
Only when we put aside
personal positions,

366
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,580
let go of what we win or lose,

367
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,660
and ignore the barriers of identity,

368
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,980
and unite and grow into an elite troop

369
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,940
under the leadership of commanders

370
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,140
can we give full play to our value

371
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,260
and be the dagger stabbing the enemies

372
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,700
on the battlefield.

373
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,380
Stand up!

374
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,860
Hand salute!

375
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,100
Down!

376
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,460
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng
made a great point.

377
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,180
You're all excellent soldiers.

378
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,340
Or you wouldn't end up
in the elite squad.

379
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,980
But being excellent

380
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,900
is only the ticket to the elite squad.

381
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,220
In the future, you'll grow together.

382
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,900
It requires you

383
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,820
to ignore personal honor and disgrace

384
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,860
as well as individualistic heroism.

385
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,140
You should learn to be
part of the collective

386
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
and bear a collective duty of honor.

387
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,340
Only in this way can our elite squad

388
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,580
become an army of fire and blood.

389
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,100
- Yes!
- Yes!

390
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,820
In recent months,

391
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,300
led by Platoon Leader Ye,

392
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,220
you've been training hard.

393
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,740
And your military qualities
have greatly improved.

394
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,420
I'd like to praise and encourage you.

395
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Hope you'll work harder

396
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
and complete the intensive training

397
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,020
with distinction.

398
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,060
- We will!
- We will!

399
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,340
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

400
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,580
Hello, ma'am.

401
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,100
Are you looking for someone?

402
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,580
Your family member?

403
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,740
He's here in the army?

404
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,940
What's his name?

405
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,340
Qian Amao.

406
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,780
Oh, Amao.

407
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,380
And who are you?

408
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,980
I'm...

409
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm his...

410
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,020
Wife?

411
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm his comrade-in-arms.

412
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,540
Please wait here.

413
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,540
I'll go get him out.

414
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,580
Amao.

415
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,420
Amao, come on.

416
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,580
Stop washing. Come on.

417
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,220
What's up?

418
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
Your wife and your son have come.

419
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,740
Where are they?

420
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,340
At the gate. Go.

421
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,860
OK, OK.

422
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,660
Chunsheng, ask for a leave for me.

423
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,580
Got it. Just go.

424
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,500
Amao's wife and son?

425
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,780
I'll go ask for his leave.

426
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,540
Talk to you later.

427
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,660
Let me go with you.

428
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,140
(1st Squad, 1st Company)

429
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,100
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

430
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,500
Why did you come?

431
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,140
You've been away from home
for a long time

432
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,700
and I'm worried.

433
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,980
Heidou missed you, too.

434
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,180
I followed the address on the letter

435
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,780
and then came with him.

436
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
You should have written a letter.

437
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,740
But you know I can't read.

438
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,740
One of our villagers

439
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,620
read the address for me.

440
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,180
You must be tired after the long trip.

441
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Let me settle you down somewhere.

442
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,300
Come on, Heidou.

443
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,300
- Go.
- Amao.

444
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,940
What are you doing here?

445
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,940
Don't worry.

446
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,860
I asked Platoon Leader Ye
for your leave.

447
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,700
Lei and I think

448
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,220
your wife seldom comes

449
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,580
and we should invite her to dinner.

450
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,380
You don't need to do that.

451
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,060
Don't nag.

452
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,820
After the long trip,
your son must be hungry.

453
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,700
Let's hurry.

454
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,420
Fine, let's go.

455
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Here. Let me carry it.

456
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,540
- Don't bother.
- Here we go.

457
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,100
Come on, go.

458
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,300
Let's go.

459
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,740
Come on.

460
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,140
Go.

461
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,660
- Have some tea, Mrs. Qian.
- Did you miss me, son?

462
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,180
(Yunnan Rice Noodles)

463
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,940
Thanks.

464
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,660
Did you miss me, son?

465
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,980
Lei, have some tea.

466
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,540
Here.

467
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,140
He's thinner.

468
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,660
Give him more to eat.

469
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,980
Here.

470
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,660
Heidou,

471
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,380
would you like some candy?

472
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
Come to me.

473
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,580
Here. Candy for you.

474
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,620
Take it.

475
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,780
Well done, Chunsheng.

476
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,380
I didn't know

477
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,940
you were really good with kids.

478
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,060
Let me hold him.

479
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,180
It's OK.

480
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,300
I'm glad he likes me.

481
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,540
Let him hold Heidou.

482
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,860
Your name is Heidou, right?

483
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,580
Where are you from?

484
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,380
Where?

485
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,700
Heidou, he asked you a question.

486
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,260
We're from the village.

487
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh, honey, here.

488
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,940
Eat some food. Hurry.

489
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,380
Come on. Eat.

490
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
What's this?

491
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Mushroom, a special local food.

492
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,020
Taste some.

493
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,540
Why does it look different
from mushrooms in our village?

494
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,020
You have no idea, huh?

495
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,100
In different places,

496
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,540
mushrooms are different, too.

497
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,300
It's good. Very delicious.

498
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,860
Enjoy more.

499
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,340
Come on.

500
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,460
Let's eat.

501
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,100
- Tastes great.
- Yeah, doesn't it?

502
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,980
You eat some, too.

503
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,940
- OK, I will.
- Eat more.

504
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,540
Enjoy it.

505
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,140
- Heidou.
- Eat.

506
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,100
Amao.

507
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,940
You have settled them down, right?

508
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,020
Yes.

509
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,540
In our military hostel.

510
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,460
After traveling for days,

511
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,820
they're tired and they're sleeping now.

512
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,820
I think

513
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,340
you should keep them company.

514
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,820
Let them have some rest.

515
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,500
When we're off in a couple of days,

516
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,740
I'll show them around the city.

517
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,180
It's a hard trip to Kunming, after all.

518
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,900
Yes.

519
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,060
Amao,

520
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,740
I wonder if I can ask you something.

521
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,940
Chunsheng,

522
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,540
we're best friends.

523
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,420
Ask me anything you want.

524
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,260
OK.

525
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,540
Heidou seems

526
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,300
to be five or six years old.

527
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,540
Your wife doesn't look young, either.

528
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,220
So, you got married...

529
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,100
Yeah, Amao.

530
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,260
Before Chunsheng asked,

531
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,660
I was too ashamed to bring it up.

532
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,340
You're one year older than Chunsheng,
and one year younger than me.

533
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,900
So, you're only 22.

534
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,780
Then you had Heidou at 16?

535
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,940
If someone else asked about this,

536
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,340
I would tell him

537
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,340
people in the village
got married very early.

538
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,380
But you asked.

539
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,220
You're the one I admire

540
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
and you're my best friend.

541
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,060
You often take care of me.

542
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
I don't want to keep anything from you.

543
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,540
So, let me tell you the truth.

544
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,860
Go ahead.

545
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,780
Qian Amao isn't my original name.

546
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,420
I had this name later.

547
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,820
I wasn't a farmer

548
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,860
or born in Eastern Zhejiang.

549
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,140
My hometown is Shanghai.

550
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
My grandpa is Qian Fengzhu,

551
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,180
a famous economist in Shanghai.

552
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,020
My father took over my grandpa's job.

553
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,940
But later...

554
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,500
Later, my family declined.

555
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,780
My parents and I

556
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
were expelled to a village
in Eastern Zhejiang.

557
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,780
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

558
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,340
Then my parents died of sicknesses.

559
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,140
I wandered to a remote village

560
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,220
where I grew up until I turned 18.

561
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,860
Then one day,

562
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,380
I met a Mr. Tan.

563
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,020
He was only six months older than me.

564
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,900
But he was far taller,

565
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,660
stronger, and braver.

566
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,380
During the farm work,

567
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,180
he noticed my weak body

568
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,940
and saw me being ordered about

569
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,300
by the idling villagers

570
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,500
and they even grabbed my grains.

571
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,220
He then asked the village official

572
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,540
to transfer me to his team.

573
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,300
Since then,

574
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,500
he had protected me like a real brother,

575
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,220
making me well fed and clothed.

576
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,300
But accidents happened unexpectedly.

577
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,780
There was a flood in the village.

578
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,820
When rebuilding the dikes,

579
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,420
I missed my footing
and fell into the flood.

580
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,700
To save my life,

581
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,020
Mr. Tan jumped in without hesitation.

582
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,580
In the end, I survived.

583
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,660
But Mr. Tan

584
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,380
was gone.

585
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,660
He was the only son of his family.

586
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,860
I knelt in front of his tablet

587
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,900
and took his parents as mine.

588
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,140
His father

589
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,380
then gave me a new name.

590
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,300
Since then,

591
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,460
I've been the only son of his family.

592
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,820
I got my life

593
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,940
and everything I have now

594
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,340
from Mr. Tan and his family.

595
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm always grateful.

596
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,900
What about Heidou?

597
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,900
He's Mr. Tan's son.

598
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,780
Lianfang is his wife.

599
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,860
Then...

600
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,220
You... You...

601
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,780
Right.

602
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,100
Lianfang is now my wife

603
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,740
and Heidou is my son.

604
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,340
You're a real man.

605
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,860
But Amao,

606
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,580
times have changed.

607
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,020
No one will look down on you

608
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,980
because of your family condition.

609
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,020
You're well-literate

610
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,540
and very capable.

611
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,220
You should make a bigger difference.

612
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,460
Chunsheng,

613
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,260
you and I are different cases.

614
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,740
How?

615
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
You're a man

616
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,420
who has his operating rules

617
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,260
in his heart.

618
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,820
That's what you believe in.

619
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,700
However hard others

620
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,380
or the world frustrates you
and slanders you,

621
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,060
you won't change your mind.

622
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,020
You're a man

623
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,580
who will have a try

624
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,740
for the moral spirit in your heart

625
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,820
even if you know it's dangerous.

626
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,540
But you sound like

627
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,980
I'm a fool.

628
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,940
No.

629
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,660
You're a hero.

630
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,460
Come on, guys.

631
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,580
That's really gross, OK?

632
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,820
You even said hero.

633
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,900
I'm unlike you.

634
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,420
Even if

635
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,940
I know there are a lot of treasures

636
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,580
after the dangerous trip,

637
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,580
I won't dare to step forward.

638
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,580
Don't worry.

639
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,900
Your story

640
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,300
will be safe

641
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,820
with us only.

642
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,460
Thanks.

643
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,220
Sir, what do you want me for?

644
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,380
I told you many times.

645
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,580
Don't call me sir when we're alone.

646
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,540
We made a deal last time.

647
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,700
In the army, you're my superior

648
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,180
and platoon leader.

649
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,980
Fine. Call me anything you want.

650
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,300
Tell me.

651
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,860
When did you see Hongling last time?

652
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,500
A long time ago, I think.

653
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,380
I've been busy training, you know.

654
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,660
Hongling even called me.

655
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,580
She kept complaining.

656
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,660
Well,

657
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,100
we're off tomorrow.

658
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,580
So is she.

659
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Pay her a visit.

660
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,580
(Reception Office)

661
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Hongling, listen.

662
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,940
Amao's wife and son

663
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,580
traveled a long way to get here.

664
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,620
As his comrade-in-arms,

665
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,220
I should do the honors

666
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,420
and entertain them.

667
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,940
Think.

668
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Since Amao came, he hasn't been out.

669
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,300
He isn't familiar with the neighborhood.

670
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,780
Tomorrow, I'll take him and his family

671
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,020
to do some shopping.

672
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,580
When they leave,

673
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,060
they should bring some local food, huh?

674
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,540
How about this?

675
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,780
You go with us.

676
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,660
It's considerate of you.

677
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,620
Help me think about what I can buy them.

678
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,340
I don't want to bother.

679
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,660
Fine. So much for this.

680
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,660
I'll hang up.

681
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,860
We'll finally have a day off tomorrow.

682
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,020
How about we go shopping?

683
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,980
Good idea.

684
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
Soybean porridge, wonton,

685
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,060
rice noodles, and ice jelly.

686
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,500
How I wish I could eat them!

687
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,620
Don't. What if you gain weight?

688
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm OK with that.

689
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,900
I'll go enjoy the food.

690
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,980
Who else wants to go?

691
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,820
Me, me.

692
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,460
I'll join you tomorrow.

693
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,740
Hongling, do you need to buy something?

694
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,820
I ran out of my cream.

695
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,500
I'd like to see if I can buy some.

696
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,700
OK.

697
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,740
Amao.

698
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,460
Is this her first trip out?

699
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,100
The commune 30 kilometers away
was the farthest place I visited.

700
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,380
Is it nice?

701
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,180
(Serve the people heart and soul)

702
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,140
Fabric for sale.

703
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,850
- Which pattern do you like?
- Pretty calico.

704
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,060
Which one do you prefer?

705
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
How about the green one?

706
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,940
Show us the green one, please.

707
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,540
OK.

708
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,460
Check that.

709
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,220
It's of good quality.

710
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,340
How much is it?

711
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,340
0.9 yuan for 33 centimeters.

712
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,620
We tie-dyed it.

713
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Look.

714
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,900
Fancy fabric.

715
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,100
How long do we need for a suit?

716
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,380
210 centimeters.

717
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,100
And one more shirt?

718
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,900
Another two pieces.

719
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,980
Two pieces?

720
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,340
Fine. I'll take one piece.

721
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,020
OK.

722
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,940
No, no.

723
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,420
Chunsheng.

724
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
I'm not buying this for you.

725
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,300
Just a welcoming gift for your wife.

726
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,020
No.

727
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,620
Chunsheng...

728
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,980
Here, cloth coupon. Take it.

729
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,060
Isn't it inappropriate?

730
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,260
Don't bother.

731
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,820
The change is 0.2 yuan.

732
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,940
Here's your change.

733
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,460
OK.

734
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,180
Please take her measurements.

735
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,700
- No problem.
- Mrs. Qian,

736
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,500
take your measurements.

737
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,300
Don't worry.

738
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,460
Fine. Go take your measurements.

739
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,540
Thank you.

740
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,420
My pleasure. You're welcome.

741
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,100
Go.

742
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,860
Go take your measurements.

743
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,420
Go.

744
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,100
Thank you, Chunsheng.

745
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Don't say that.

746
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,860
She seldom comes out.

747
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,340
Keep her company.

748
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,740
Leave Heidou to me without concern.

749
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,700
He's a very lovely boy.

750
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,780
I wish he could stay
with me all day long.

751
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,980
Sorry for the trouble, Chunsheng.

752
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,900
No trouble at all.

753
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,900
By the way,

754
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,500
have you brought enough money?

755
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,460
Yes.

756
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,780
I've brought all my money.

757
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,140
There's a lot to buy.

758
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,940
So, you were well prepared.

759
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,540
Pinwheel.

760
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,500
Pinwheel?

761
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,620
Pinwheel.

762
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,220
Heidou, you like the pinwheel?

763
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,500
I'll buy one for you.

764
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,820
Come on.

765
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,620
Heidou, Heidou.

766
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,540
Remember.

767
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,940
Listen to Mr. Xiao. Do you hear?

768
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,860
All right.

769
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,900
Don't worry. Here we go.

770
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,460
- OK.
- Go.

771
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,300
Mrs. Qian, we should go.

772
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,980
What other measurements do you need?

773
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,460
No more. It's done.

774
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,220
Oh...

775
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,860
This shirt looks pretty.

776
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,580
Hongling, what are you looking at?

777
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,100
Nothing.

778
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,020
The market is so big,

779
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
stretching as far as eyes can see.

780
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,740
Yeah.

781
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,660
The market opens every few days.

782
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,140
People from nearby towns
come here for shopping.

783
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,020
So lively.

784
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,500
We can spend a day here.

785
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,260
This one suits Mengmeng.

786
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,740
Mengmeng, come take a look.

787
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,900
I'll go and sit for a while.

788
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,460
OK.

789
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,700
Take it up and look.

790
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,020
Do you like this?

791
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,980
Come on. Blow it.

792
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,060
Good.

793
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,740
Rabbit.

794
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,420
Rabbit?

795
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,380
Now, you turn to the rabbit?

796
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,300
Rabbit.

797
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,380
Which one do you like?

798
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,060
What about the black one?

799
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,900
How much is it?

800
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,620
One yuan.

801
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,580
One?

802
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,300
What about that one?

803
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,380
The smaller one.

804
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,700
The same price.

805
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,940
OK. Heidou, which do you...

806
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,980
Kid, would you like some?

807
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,180
Sorry.

808
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,060
Heidou, didn't I tell you

809
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,860
not to run about?

810
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,700
If you were lost,

811
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,100
what could I explain to your parents?

812
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,780
Why are you so rude to the boy?

813
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,460
Hongling? What are you doing here?

814
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,300
It's not your market.

815
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,740
Why can't I come?

816
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,860
What are you waiting for?

817
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,980
Don't you see he wants that?

818
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,980
Heidou, do you want that?

819
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,460
You do?

820
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,500
Two, please.

821
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,900
OK.

822
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,340
Come on. Go.

823
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,340
Take a seat.

824
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,940
Sit here.

825
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
He's so cute.

826
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,900
Who's he?

827
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,900
Amao's son.

828
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,900
Eat it.

829
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,700
How does it taste?

830
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,860
Great.

831
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,660
Really? Then eat more.

832
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,060
Oh, Hongling,

833
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,100
what are you doing here?

834
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,180
What do you think?

835
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,780
For me, huh?

836
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,780
Good.

837
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,500
When Amao and his wife

838
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,740
come here after shopping,

839
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,260
shall we go for a stroll together?

840
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,140
Sure.

841
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,860
OK.

842
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,820
When do you have to return today?

843
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,580
No hurry.

844
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,300
Really?

845
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,300
Did you come alone?

846
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,780
No. With my roommates.

847
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,860
All right.

848
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,420
Enjoy the food.

849
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,140
As much as you want.

850
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,860
(Be vigilant to defend our country)
Heidou, good boy.

851
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,340
Go back home with me.

852
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,540
I don't want to go home.
Dad isn't there.

853
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,380
Wherever Dad stays, I stay.

854
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,140
Heidou.

855
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,740
Good boy, listen to Mom.

856
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,180
After the Spring Festival,

857
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,500
I'll ask Mom

858
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,820
to take you here for Dad, OK?

859
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,260
Heidou, you're a little young man.

860
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,180
Help your father look after your mother,

861
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,180
understand?

862
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,500
Did you hear Mr. Xiao?

863
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,300
- Come on.
- Go to Mom.

864
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,860
Here.

865
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,540
Good boy.

866
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,820
I'll send you to the train station.

867
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,020
Mrs. Qian, stay safe on your way back.

868
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,540
Don't worry about your husband.

869
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,980
We're here for him.

870
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,660
Right.

871
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,980
Sorry for the trouble.

872
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,060
Don't say that.

873
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,380
Come on, Heidou.

874
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,180
Say goodbye to them.

875
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,140
Goodbye.

876
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,260
Goodbye, Heidou.

877
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
- Bye-bye.
- Farewell.

878
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,580
OK. I'll go send them.

879
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,060
Here.

880
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,180
Be careful.

881
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,420
Thank you, guys.

882
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,300
See you, Mrs. Qian.

883
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,180
See you.

884
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,660
Comrades,

885
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
next week, we'll have

886
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,020
a live training exercise

887
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,860
to check what you've got
from recent training.

888
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,060
Get ready for that!

889
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

890
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
This place is a desert,

891
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,140
about ten kilometers away
from our enemy's frontline.

892
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,580
So, we can furtively

893
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,700
transport our weapons here

894
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,900
before we sneak into
the enemy's observation spot.

895
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,220
In the same way,

896
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,340
we can...

897
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,060
Stand up!

898
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,620
Hand salute!

899
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,300
Down!

900
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,620
What have you got yet?

901
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,460
For your information, sir,

902
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,220
we're discussing

903
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,540
how to quickly locate our enemy

904
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
and do the reconnaissance mission.

905
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,980
Go on.

906
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,420
Yes!

907
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,700
Come on.

908
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,940
(Ye Guohua saw Meng Jinzhu, Duan Lei,)

909
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,700
(and Qian Amao surround Xiao Chunsheng.)

910
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,420
(He kind of saw
what Xiao Chunsheng used to be.)

911
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,820
(But due to the identity change,)

912
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,540
(he also realized)

913
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,980
(that he and Xiao Chunsheng)

914
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,180
(were drifting apart.)

915
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,820
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

916
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,020
Young man, you're awesome.

917
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,780
I'm convinced.

918
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,780
Yesterday, I read the Reference News.

919
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,620
The analysis on it
is exactly the same as yours.

920
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,100
Look.

921
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,100
We've started the live training exercise.

922
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,220
Your analysis is really correct, I think.

923
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,780
I've noticed you have a real talent

924
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,980
for military affairs.

925
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,740
Chunsheng, may I remind you?

926
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,940
Go ahead.

927
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,180
Sometimes, for someone else's dignity,

928
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,020
you keep a low profile.

929
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,700
At that time, he may think

930
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,460
you're sensible.

931
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,380
But in the long run,

932
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,580
he might feel uneasy.

933
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,340
Because the way
you do things at the outset

934
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,500
indicates something.

935
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,500
That is, you do better than him.

936
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,460
Then do you think

937
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,100
I should show off?

938
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,820
No.

939
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,700
Think about it.

940
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,940
Even when you keep a low profile,
others may think

941
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,860
their pride is hurt.

942
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,780
If you show off,

943
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,700
people will be jealous

944
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,620
or even

945
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,180
hate you.

946
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,140
So,

947
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,780
whatever I do,

948
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,620
I'm just to blame, huh?

949
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,460
The moon is so bright.

950
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,300
Do you think it's to blame?

951
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,140
The moon isn't to blame.

952
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,420
Those who can't tolerate its light
should be blamed.

953
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,180
Chunsheng,

954
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,620
childhood friends are precious.

955
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
They're restrained, too.

956
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,380
Because they're not chosen by us,

957
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,980
but by the environment we live in,

958
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,980
the jobs of our parents,

959
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,260
the address of our family,

960
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,460
schools, and even classes we go to.

961
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,100
So many factors

962
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,980
picked the friends for us.

963
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,060
In most cases,

964
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,380
when we get into adulthood,

965
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,220
we'll screen

966
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,660
our childhood friends.

967
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,980
Some like-minded friends

968
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
can move on together.

969
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,340
But some have different goals.

970
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,460
Forced friends

971
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,580
won't end up very well.

972
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,260
You make a great point.

973
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,860
But that's pessimism and fatalism.

974
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,140
I still believe

975
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,700
true people deserve true feelings.

976
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,980
You... You're just so thoughtless.

977
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,860
When you're betrayed,

978
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,620
you'll know how wrong you are.

979
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,540
You know what?

980
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,860
Even if I'm betrayed, I won't regret it.

981
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,620
Come on.

982
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,780
You're just a stubborn

983
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,260
and self-absorbed man

984
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,100
like a rock in the ditch.

985
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,780
Wrong.

986
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,140
As stubborn as a mule.

987
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,140
I've read as many books as you do.

988
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,340
Come on.

989
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,060
But honestly,

990
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,100
I hope you're right.

991
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,100
It can at least prove

992
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,180
the world is better than I imagined.

993
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,380
Wait and see.

994
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,220
One day,

995
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,580
I'll prove it to all of you.

996
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,260
The day isn't breaking yet.

997
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,460
Why are you putting on makeup

998
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,020
instead of getting more sleep?

999
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,100
None of your business.

1000
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,380
Later,

1001
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,740
we'll wait in line
at the Department Store.

1002
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,020
Why do you need makeup?

1003
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,420
Who would even notice you?

1004
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,180
It's just your fault.

1005
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,100
You insist on being a profiteer.

1006
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,420
Insane.

1007
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,180
What's wrong with being a profiteer?

1008
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,380
Li Shangyou went to the South once

1009
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,020
and when he was back, he looked
like a merchant from Hong Kong.

1010
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,860
He's even wearing a gold chain.

1011
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,980
Doesn't he find it too heavy?

1012
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,580
He just trades things.

1013
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,660
I can surely do better than him.

1014
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,100
Come on. Why must you compete

1015
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
with Li Shangyou?

1016
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,780
I don't mean to compete with him.

1017
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,460
But who doesn't want money, huh?

1018
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,940
You could have slept more.

1019
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,860
(Department Store)

1020
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,300
Is your information reliable?

1021
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Don't worry, Heizi.

1022
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,740
Today, the Department Store will offer

1023
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,140
a batch of wool scarves.

1024
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,260
It must be accurate.

1025
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,940
So, your female primary school classmate

1026
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,900
told you that, huh?

1027
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,460
Don't underestimate her.

1028
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,900
She isn't good-looking,

1029
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,780
but she's got something.

1030
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,380
Her parents work
in No. 1 Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

1031
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,260
Or she couldn't have got a job here.

1032
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,540
Dude.

1033
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,220
Tell me the truth.

1034
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,860
Are you pursuing her?

1035
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,660
Me?

1036
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,460
She's quite plump.

1037
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,940
When she jumps,
I even fear the ground would crack.

1038
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,020
Don't joke like that.

1039
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,900
Heizi, he was exaggerating.

1040
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,020
I met that girl before.

1041
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,420
She's a little plump, but very pretty.

1042
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,820
No.

1043
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,780
You know what?

1044
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,380
A plump girl is usually pretty.

1045
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,260
Heizi, you know quite a lot.

1046
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Indeed.

1047
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,980
Oh, just kidding.

1048
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,820
To be honest,

1049
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,820
she can give us some information

1050
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,660
and keep some commodities for us.

1051
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,060
Or I wouldn't even talk to her.

1052
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,700
Don't say that, dude.

1053
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,460
You don't hate money, do you?

1054
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,140
No.

1055
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,060
In my opinion,

1056
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,700
to get money,

1057
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
you can just make some sacrifices.

1058
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,180
That's what I think, too.

1059
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,620
To make some money,

1060
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,180
I can sell my charms

1061
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,380
and commit myself to her.

1062
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,220
It's a sacrifice but I'm fine.

1063
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,380
You? Commit yourself?

1064
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,060
You don't even know if she wants you.

1065
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,660
There it is. It's open.
