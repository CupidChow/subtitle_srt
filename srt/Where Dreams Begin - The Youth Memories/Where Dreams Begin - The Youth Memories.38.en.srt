=Episode 38=

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,640
All of us?

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
Yes, you have to do this.

5
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,120
This is a dangerous situation.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
OK, Xiaomei, I trust you.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,400
I will arrange it now.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,600
You are the same.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
You also need to be quarantined.

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,560
Don't contact people outside for now.

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,000
I got it.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,680
What about you?

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
I was in contact with the patients.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
I was asked to do a self-quarantine.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,200
OK.

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,280
Xiaomei,

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,600
you must be careful.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,160
I know.

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't worry about me.

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,800
Although the hospital
is exposed to a lot of germs,

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
the protection measures here
are also the best.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,320
Xiaomei, don't be careless.

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,080
Just now you said that
it's an infectious disease.

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
Please be careful.

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,000
I will.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Take good care of Beibei.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,280
Don't worry, I'll tell Beibei to go

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
to Yanqiu's place after school.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Take care of yourself.

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,920
You too.

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Dr. Tong,

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I have been searching online
for the past two days,

33
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,000
but found no information

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
about the clinical symptoms,
protective methods

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
and therapies of this pneumonia.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
What if we misjudge it?

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,560
That's right.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Too many people
need to be quarantined now.

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,040
In case of mistake,

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,440
we will have to
shoulder the responsibilities.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
That's right.

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,680
Dr. Tong,

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,120
I am still a trainee doctor,

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm afraid I'd be fired.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Maybe

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,000
we should discuss it
with Director Tao first.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
If Cai is quarantined,

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
then Director Tao

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,600
will also be quarantined.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Don't worry.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,880
I am the one who filed the report.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
If I'm wrong,

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
I will be responsible for it.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,480
Our hospital is the best hospital

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
in the whole city,
and even the whole country.

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Thousands of patients
come here every day.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
If most medical staff

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,480
were quarantined,

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,720
it would make a big impact

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,080
on their treatment.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
As medical staff,

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,600
we are a fence between the virus

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,520
and ordinary people.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
So for their sake,

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
we must not let this virus

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
spread out through us.

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,280
(Medical Supplies)
What's going on?

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
We are not allowed to leave

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,440
or work.

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,520
Could it be that
something big really happened?

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Maybe.

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
They should explain it to us.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,390
We have the right to know.

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
Chunsheng,

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,880
what's going on?

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,480
We need this batch of export orders

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
from Huasheng to open up

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
new markets.

79
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
If the production is suspended now,

80
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,640
we'll suffer a great loss.

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Tian, listen to me.

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,320
Cai may have an infectious disease.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
People who have been
in close contact with him

84
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,200
are at risk of infection.

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,920
But Cai's problem is not confirmed.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
How can I ask them

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
to be quarantined in the factory?

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
I trust Xiaomei's professional judgment.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
Still, you have to
give everyone an explanation.

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,280
Everybody does not understand at all.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,160
How do you want me to quarantine them?

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,480
Tian,

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
I haven't figured out
how to tell them yet.

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Give me some more time.

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,520
Hello, Guohua, what's the matter?

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,280
Chunsheng, David is very satisfied
with this batch of equipment.

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,560
He wants to talk about new projects,

98
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880
and is going to introduce me
to several other clients.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,280
I think this is a good opportunity.

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm going to

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
visit several other countries
in Southeast Asia.

102
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
Are you coming with me?

103
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I can't go now.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,760
What's wrong?

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm arriving at your factory.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
Let's talk face to face.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Chunsheng,

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
what happened?

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
Guohua, listen to me.

110
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,440
A worker in the factory was sick

111
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
and sent to hospital.

112
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
The situation is extremely urgent now.

113
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,400
Xiaomei told me

114
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,120
it is very likely that

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,800
he has a respiratory infectious disease.

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
All of us now

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,680
have to be quarantined.

118
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
So this time,

119
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
I can't go with you.

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
You have to do it yourself.

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,920
Chunsheng,

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,720
in this case, I also have to stay.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,320
Guohua,

124
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,560
do you remember

125
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,920
when I asked you

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,880
to deliver the information

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,080
on the battlefield?

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,680
It's not that I wanted
to show off my bravery

129
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,280
and take the risk for you.

130
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,920
I just believed that

131
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
if only one of us

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,080
could walk out of the battlefield

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
and bring back reinforcement,

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
it must not be me, Xiao Chunsheng,

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,200
but you, Ye Guohua.

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,960
Guohua,

137
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
I believe

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
you will definitely get the orders,

139
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
and bring Huasheng back to life.

140
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,080
(Nurse Station)
The patient in Bed No. 2 is newly delivered.

141
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Pay more attention to him.

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,200
Get the medicine for Bed No. 3.

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,680
Be careful.

144
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Dr. Tong,

145
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
how is it going?

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,640
The outpatient clinic received
a large number of fever patients.

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Specialists in Respiratory Medicine

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
are having a meeting now.

149
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Some of them think

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,080
we are overacting.

151
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,680
They think it's just a seasonal flu.

152
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,480
But Director Wang

153
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
is adamant that

154
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,120
we should

155
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,240
try our best

156
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,160
to control it.

157
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
We must do that.

158
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
Protect yourself well.

159
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,360
Thank you.

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,520
You too.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Go ahead.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,080
- Be careful.
- Slow down.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,320
everyone present

165
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
is like my sibling.

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
You are all like my family.

167
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
So I won't

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,440
hide anything from you.

169
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I'll tell you all.

170
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,720
The doctors said he might have got

171
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,560
a highly contagious type of pneumonia

172
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,400
that we have never met before.

173
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,160
Everyone here

174
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
might be infected.

175
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Listen to me, everyone.

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Please listen to me.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,840
I know you must be scared right now.

178
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,360
I can understand.

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,120
To be honest,

180
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm more scared than any of you now,

181
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,600
because my wife, Tong Xiaomei,

182
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,400
is in the hospital,

183
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,440
fighting against

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,160
this unknown virus.

185
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
I asked the doctor what we should do.

186
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,560
The only answer

187
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,120
is to stay in the factory

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,160
for a centralized quarantine,

189
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,030
so that this virus won't have any chance

190
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,880
to hurt our friends and family.

191
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,150
I assure you

192
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,360
that during the quarantine,

193
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,200
we will provide you

194
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,200
all the necessities of life.

195
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,240
Please stay.

196
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,640
Trust me,

197
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,400
you won't regret this.

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,280
I trust Mr. Xiao, I will stay.

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
- Let's stay.
- I'll stay.

200
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,560
Let's stay.

201
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,200
I will stay.

202
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,000
Me too.

203
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
OK, everyone stays.

204
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Hello, Xiaomei.

205
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,240
Have you gone to bed?

206
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Not yet.

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,360
I can't sleep.

208
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
What's on your mind?

209
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm just a little restless.

210
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,520
Patients are being brought in
one by one.

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,800
Time is life now.

212
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,840
We are racing against time.

213
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,520
I have no idea

214
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,200
how long this will last.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,680
I understand.

216
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,240
It's like watching the sun rise
and the moon set every day,

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,680
but we don't know
what will happen tomorrow.

218
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,360
By the way,

219
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
I knew you and Tian
were both in the factory,

220
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
and I couldn't leave the hospital,

221
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,800
so I called Yanqiu to let her

222
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,000
take Beibei to her place.

223
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
She can play with Qi Miao there.

224
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
So don't worry.

225
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
OK, I got it.

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,520
Don't worry about home.

227
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,040
I will take care of everything.

228
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Chunsheng, are you afraid?

229
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Do you want to hear the truth?

230
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,240
I am afraid.

231
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I was most afraid

232
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,800
when you told me you were gonna

233
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,040
be quarantined.

234
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
I have lost comrades

235
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
on the battlefield,

236
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,840
I don't want to lose

237
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
the one I love the most

238
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
to a war without smoke.

239
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Chunsheng,

240
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,960
I miss you.

241
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
I miss you too.

242
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,800
Everything is fine at home.

243
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,040
Do not worry.

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
We are all waiting for you to come back.

245
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,000
Dr. Tong.

246
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,880
Are you all right?

247
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm fine.

248
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,760
I think I'm too tired.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,040
I'll just take a break.

250
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
Yeah, you should have some rest.

251
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,020
(Calling from Xiao Beibei)

252
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
(Calling from Xiao Beibei)

253
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,440
Hello, Mom? Where are you?

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Why didn't you answer my call just now?

255
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
I was busy.

256
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
You scared me.

257
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,040
Just now, I heard the news say

258
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
that a lot of medical staff are infected.

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,960
Mom, don't let that happen to you.

260
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Don't worry. Mom is fine.

261
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,160
Take care of yourself, OK?

262
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
I have to go back to work.

263
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
I have to hang up now.

264
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Alright, I just wanted to know
if you are alright.

265
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
You can go back to work now.

266
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,820
(Calling from Chunsheng)

267
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
(Calling from Chunsheng)

268
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,920
Chunsheng.

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,640
Xiaomei.

270
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,920
What's the matter?

271
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,680
Why are you crying?

272
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
No, I'm not.

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,280
Don't lie to me.

274
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
We've been married for so many years.

275
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
I know you are crying.

276
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm really not.

277
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

278
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,200
You must have had a long day.

279
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,560
Alright.

280
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
You should get some rest now.

281
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
Let's talk tomorrow.

282
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,760
Wait.

283
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Don't hang up.

284
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
OK, I won't.

285
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm here for you.

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240
Beibei called me just now.

287
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,520
She didn't say much.

288
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
But after thinking about it,

289
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,240
I want you to tell her something for me.

290
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,600
You tell her
not to eat puffed food too much.

291
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
It's not good for her health.

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
And don't let her
wear headphones all the time.

293
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
That's bad for her hearing.

294
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Our bankbooks

295
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
and all the important documents

296
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,880
are all in that closet in the bedroom.

297
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
The passwords are your birthday.

298
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,160
And you,

299
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
we are not young anymore,

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
don't always go to bed too late.

301
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,800
And don't always think about work.

302
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,320
They are not going anywhere.

303
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,400
Xiaomei,

304
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,760
what's wrong?

305
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,640
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

306
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,800
Wait.

307
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Tell me the truth.

308
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,830
What happened?

309
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,840
Chunsheng.

310
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm infected.

311
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,320
What...

312
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
I took all the protection,

313
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,400
but still got infected.

314
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,200
If I can

315
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,320
make it this time,

316
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,920
my biggest regret will be

317
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,640
that I couldn't see you and Beibei again.

318
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,520
Xiaomei.

319
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,600
Don't say that!

320
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,680
You will make it!

321
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,360
You will get better!

322
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,320
Listen to me.

323
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
Since my childhood,

324
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,480
I've only been scared

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,760
twice.

326
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,720
The first time

327
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,680
was the year you came back
from the battlefield.

328
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
I was afraid you
wouldn't be able to stand up again.

329
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,280
The second time is now.

330
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,120
I'm afraid I really can't survive this.

331
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
I'm afraid our family of three

332
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,160
won't be able to reunite again.

333
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,120
Xiaomei,

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
you are the backbone

335
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,920
of our family.

336
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,880
I really can't live without you.

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
If anything happens to you,

338
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,800
I will be crushed by the heavy burden.

339
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,040
Chunsheng.

340
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
Xiaomei, you don't know

341
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,200
what Chunxiao has experienced

342
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,560
when you're not around.

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
The workers didn't understand,

344
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,280
clients canceled their orders,

345
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,640
suppliers demanded the payment.

346
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
I really can't hold it anymore.

347
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,160
Why didn't you tell me

348
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,920
such important things earlier?

349
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
You are fighting the virus
in the hospital,

350
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,640
I really don't want you to worry.

351
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,480
Chunsheng,

352
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,480
pull yourself together.

353
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,120
Think about it.

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
Why did we

355
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,840
founded Chunxiao in the first place?

356
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
They didn't understand you,

357
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,720
but they trusted you.

358
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
We must live up to their trust.

359
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,720
Yes.

360
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,600
Xiaomei, you are right.

361
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
I must hang in there,

362
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,040
and so do you.

363
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,360
Alright?

364
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,760
Xiaomei,

365
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,040
although we can't see each other now,

366
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
we both have an uphill battle to fight.

367
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,360
I will not give up,

368
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,000
so you must not give up.

369
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Do you understand?

370
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,040
Xiaomei, promise me

371
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
you will get better

372
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,120
and be discharged in good health

373
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,400
to reunite with me and Beibei.

374
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,000
Alright.

375
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
I promise you.

376
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,580
(Nurse Station)

377
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,120
Dr. Tong.

378
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,960
Be good, Beibei.

379
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,440
You must listen to Dad

380
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,720
and don't go out.

381
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Do not worry.

382
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,320
Dad is going to the hospital for Mom.

383
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,960
Be good.

384
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
Where are you going, Chunsheng?

385
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,880
To the hospital.

386
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
You can't go there!

387
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
You can't help even if you go!

388
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,240
What if you get infected too?

389
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,560
Tian, I lost contact with Xiaomei.

390
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,760
And the phone in the hospital
is always busy.

391
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,320
I can't get through
to her colleague's phone either.

392
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
I have to go to the hospital

393
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,800
to see what's going on.

394
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,880
I know you are worried,

395
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,360
but you can't panic at this time.

396
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
Xiaomei got infected.

397
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
- I... I...
- Alright.

398
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,360
You are scaring yourself.

399
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,560
Hello?

400
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,160
What is it?

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,000
Xiaomei's condition worsened
and she is in the intensive care unit.

402
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,880
Chunsheng, you can't go!

403
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,280
You must calm down now.

404
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,360
We'll be doomed if you collapse.

405
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,960
You're right.

406
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,680
I can't collapse.

407
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
I can't collapse.

408
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
Dr. Tong, you are awake!

409
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,600
Dr. Tong, you are amazing!

410
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,800
Hello.

411
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,160
Is it Guohua?

412
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,880
Chunsheng, it is me.

413
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,360
I've made a deal with David.

414
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,720
He has decided
to continue our cooperation.

415
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,640
I think

416
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
they have already

417
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,360
transferred the deposit.

418
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,800
Really?

419
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,320
He's reliable.

420
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,560
Chunsheng,

421
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,280
I didn't come in vain this time.

422
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,480
They value our sincerity very much

423
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,200
and want to add an order.

424
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
They also said

425
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
we'll have the pricing rights

426
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,960
for the subsequent orders.

427
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,880
Chunsheng, it shows

428
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,360
they are very appreciative
of Chunxiao's new technology.

429
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,480
Guohua,

430
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,400
I will ship this order on time.

431
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,000
But I want to talk to you

432
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
about the subsequent orders

433
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,680
when you come back.

434
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,320
Chunsheng,

435
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,040
we got this chance through hardship,

436
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,560
we have to hang on to it.

437
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Guohua, the current situation in Beijing

438
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,440
is more serious than we expected.

439
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,400
There's a shortage of medical supplies.

440
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
Let's just put

441
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
other things aside for now.

442
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah?

443
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,480
In this case,

444
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,880
I'll contact the overseas
Chinese organizations here,

445
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,760
and purchase

446
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,520
some medical supplies
and ship them back to Beijing.

447
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,640
By the way,

448
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,800
how is Xiaomei now?

449
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,160
Her condition is stable now.

450
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,560
Chunsheng, take care of yourself.

451
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,680
You too.

452
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,160
I believe

453
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,160
you have learned

454
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,240
about what's happening outside.

455
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,440
Our quarantine period

456
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
is over.

457
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,080
You can finally go home

458
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,680
and reunite with your family.

459
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,560
But I still have a favor to ask.

460
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,910
Healthcare workers are fighting
an uphill battle right now.

461
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,810
There's an urgent need
of various medical supplies

462
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,600
and equipment.

463
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,600
(House Property Mortgage Certificate)
This is all I have.

464
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,600
I have mortgaged it to the bank.

465
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,120
I'll get the loans soon.

466
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,760
The equipment will arrive tomorrow.

467
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,720
We'll produce masks.

468
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
I hope you can stay

469
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,480
to help Chunxiao

470
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
and also help ourselves.

471
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,880
I know everyone has doubts,

472
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
but now the whole country

473
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,120
is fighting this fierce battle.

474
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,880
They need our help.

475
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,360
Do you remember

476
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
what Chunxiao's original intention is?

477
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,240
To benefit the people!

478
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,280
That's right.

479
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,440
We must

480
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
remember that forever.

481
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
The first batch of masks

482
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,240
we produce

483
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,320
will be a free donation.

484
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,150
Free?

485
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,880
Don't worry, everyone.

486
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,120
Everyone of you
will get what you deserve.

487
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,960
The technical support has arrived.

488
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
If you are willing to stay
in such a dangerous situation,

489
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
I'll give you double pay.

490
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,680
Of course, if you want to leave
and be with your family,

491
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,880
I totally understand.

492
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,480
I'll donate

493
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
all my dividends.

494
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,200
Now that we are doing it,

495
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,560
we must do it big!

496
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,480
Bravo!

497
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:56,840
- Well said!
- Good!

498
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Hello, Xiaomei.

499
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
How do you feel now?

500
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't worry.

501
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm fine.

502
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,400
I will recover soon.

503
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,800
How is the situation at the factory?

504
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,680
Don't worry, we made it through.

505
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
We are now

506
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
waiting for your triumphant return.

507
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,880
OK.

508
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,120
This won't do.

509
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,760
The ear straps are not firm enough.

510
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,920
Look.

511
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,640
OK, I see. Go back to work now.

512
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,440
OK.

513
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,560
What's up?

514
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,160
Tian, take a look.

515
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,400
The ear straps are not firm enough.

516
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
Let the technicians

517
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,240
from the R&D center take a look

518
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
and solve the problem.

519
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
There's one more thing.

520
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,200
Not only the machines
became more expensive,

521
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,080
the price of meltblown cloth
is also rising.

522
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm afraid that our liquidity

523
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
won't last long.

524
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,840
OK, I got it.

525
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,960
I'll figure it out.

526
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,280
Just try your best

527
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,760
to make it work for now.

528
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,480
I'll talk to the banks
and the government

529
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
to see if they can help us.

530
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,840
Is there a problem with the loans?

531
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,000
It's just not that fast.

532
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
Don't worry.

533
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,040
I'll figure it out.

534
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,400
But our production must not stop.

535
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,880
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

536
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
The medical masks have been received.

537
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,880
You did us a big favor.

538
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,560
You are too kind.

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,760
That's the least we can do.

540
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,800
We have tried a lot of methods

541
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,800
to solve the shortage of masks.

542
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,440
We contacted a lot of suppliers,
but none of them could help us.

543
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
Now enterprises

544
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,520
with a sense of social responsibility

545
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
are helping us big time.

546
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
This is a special period.

547
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Our enterprise is closely related
to the lives of the people.

548
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,880
We are duty-bound to help.

549
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,760
I know

550
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
you suffered a big loss after donating

551
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,240
one million medical masks.

552
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,080
We'll have a meeting

553
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,360
with the bank

554
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,880
to try to help you
get a low-interest loan.

555
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,640
That would be a great help to us!

556
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,160
To tell you the truth,

557
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,680
our funding is really tight.

558
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,680
Now with government support,

559
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,920
I feel at ease.

560
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,400
Now our factory

561
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,040
can produce more

562
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,520
medical supplies.

563
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,360
To provide support for enterprises

564
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
is the responsibility
and obligation of the government.

565
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,280
Tell us if you have any difficulties.

566
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
Thank you for your support.

567
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,560
Thank you.

568
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,480
You are welcome, Mr. Xiao.

569
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,080
Goodbye.

570
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,760
Goodbye.

571

(United and Dedicated)
I swear,

572
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,840
I will follow the code
of professional ethics for physicians.

573
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,480
With a heart of compassion...

574
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Chunsheng,

575
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,720
I want to stay.

576
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,640
I know what you want to say,

577
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,800
but allow me to be selfish,

578
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,720
only for this once.

579
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,320
Set off.

580
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,680
(Nurse Station)
I can't hide behind my colleagues

581
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,840
when they are fighting the virus

582
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,360
on the front lines.

583
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,720
This batch of masks is finally finished.

584
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,160
Tian.

585
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,480
What did Guohua say
about the overseas supplies?

586
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,400
He said he had arranged people

587
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,000
to meet you directly at the hospital.

588
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,560
OK.

589
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,560
Thank you all for your hard work.

590
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,880
You had to

591
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
work overtime in this situation.

592
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,120
Thank you.

593
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,960
We should thank you.

594
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,920
Mr. Xiao,

595
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,120
to be honest,

596
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,040
I complained at first,

597
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,120
but I'm glad we did
what you and Xiaomei told us to do.

598
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,760
We were quarantined early,

599
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
so everyone is healthy now,

600
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,880
so do our families.

601
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,640
We are glad to do our part.

602
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,280
When you see Dr. Tong,

603
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,240
please thank her on behalf of all of us.

604
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,360
Yes, please thank her.

605
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,080
OK.

606
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
If I see Xiaomei,

607
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,760
I'll tell her what you said.

608
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Tian, did you contact the hospital?

609
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
It's all done.

610
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,360
I'll directly

611
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,480
take these masks
to the frontline hospital.

612
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,400
You don't have to go. I'll go.

613
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,240
I'll deliver it myself.

614
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
You can't.

615
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,080
Chunxiao and your family need you.

616
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Xiaomei is there.

617
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Alright then.

618
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,400
Be careful.

It's New Year's Eve,

644
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,160
and I want to say something.

645
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,400
This year

646
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,400
has been tough for our country.

647
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,920
Everyone

648
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,400
had a tough year.

649
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,000
But luckily, it's all over now.

650
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,520
I propose

651
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,630
a toast

652
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,520
to our brave warrior,

653
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,560
Comrade Tong Xiaomei.

654
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,440
Chunsheng,

655
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,520
why are you being so serious?

656
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,040
I must be serious about this.

657
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,150
Come on, to our warrior.

658
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,840
- Xiaomei.
- Come on.

659
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,440
- Thank you.
- Come on.

660
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,320
Thank you.

661
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,120
To Mom!

662
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,400
Xiaomei,

663
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,040
give us a speech.

664
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't know

665
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
what to say.

666
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
This half a year

667
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,000
feels longer than my whole life.

668
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I have seen so many deaths

669
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,720
that I feel my heart got older.

670
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,400
After a patient of mine died,

671
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,880
I went through his phone

672
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,440
for his family's numbers,

673
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,960
but it was filled

674
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,600
with messages asking where he was.

675
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,760
He couldn't

676
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,280
meet his family in the end.

677
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,640
After going through so much,

678
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,160
I thank you

679
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
for your consistent support,

680
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
and I also thank you

681
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,920
for taking care of
Chunsheng and Beibei for me.

682
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,320
In the future,

683
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,320
I will cherish the good life.

684
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
A toast

685
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,360
to all of you.

686
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

687
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,520
You are welcome.

688
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,200
Come on.

689
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,720
Thank you, Yanqiu.

690
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880
Why are you
proposing toasts to each other?

691
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,640
We are family.

692
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,120
We don't need to do that.

693
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,640
Beibei is right.

694
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,760
This accident

695
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,680
must have changed many people's lives.

696
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Only in the face of life and death

697
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,040
can people realize
what is really important.

698
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,480
That's why Professor Ye
decided to take a step forward.

699
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,720
When will you

700
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,840
let us meet your new boyfriend?

701
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,120
Xiaomei.

702
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,000
Wait a minute.

703
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,760
Fang,

704
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,880
you have a boyfriend now?

705
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,320
Why didn't you tell us?

706
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,560
Say it yourself.

707
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,960
OK. OK.

708
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,360
I'll tell you.

709
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,160
He is a college professor.

710
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,480
I won't tell you anything else about him.

711
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,720
Fang, what are your future plans?

712
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,000
I still want to be a teacher in college.

713
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,000
The relationships are simple there.

714
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,040
When I have time,

715
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
I want to write a story about us.

716
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,960
Our story?

717
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,200
That's good.

718
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,760
Come.

719
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
Let's wish Fang an early

720
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,720
realization of her dream.

721
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,680
- Cheers.
- OK.

722
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,440
Good.

723
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,560
- Thank you.
- We are looking forward to it.

724
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,600
It's Guohua.

725
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Hello, Guohua.

726
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
Happy New Year!

727
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,760
Everybody is here. Come on.

728
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,880
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

729
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,040
Happy New Year!

730
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,640
When will you come back?

731
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,640
Maybe next year.

732
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,120
I'll go back after I open up
the entire South Asian market.

733
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,040
Guohua,

734
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,040
I'll go to South Asia

735
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,960
for an academic exchange this year.

736
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,280
I'll visit you when the time comes.

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,440
Don't come.

738
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,600
I don't want to see you.

739
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,560
You'll nag me all the time.

740
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
You think I wanna see you?

741
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,720
What's wrong with him?

742
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,600
Come on, give it to me.

743
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,600
Chunsheng,

744
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,280
are you all

745
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
at your house?

746
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,640
- Yes.
- We are all here.

747
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,680
We are all here.

748
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,120
Well,

749
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,840
Guohua,

Hongling wrote from Paris.

751
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,860
She finally realized her dream

752
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,450
of studying in an advanced music school.

753
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,400
She's not asking for any result.

754
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,200
She just wants

755
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,920
to live for herself once.

756
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,280
Yeah?

757
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,360
That's good.

758
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,640
A new start

759
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,920
is good.

760
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,160
Guohua,

761
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
time really flies.

762

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,320

765

when we skated together at Shichahai.

766
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,200
That is where our dreams began.

767
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,520
Yes.

768
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,520
That is where our dreams began.
