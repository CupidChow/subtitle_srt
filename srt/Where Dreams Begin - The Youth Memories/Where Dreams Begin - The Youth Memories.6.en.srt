3
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,830
Did Qi Tian say

4
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,270
when he will leave?

5
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,550
Qi Tian told Xiao Chunsheng

6
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,470
on the night of the day after tomorrow,

7
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,680
he would pick up a batch of goods
from Badachu

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,970
and give someone a birthday gift.

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,740
Then he would take off.

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,180
Well, Qi Tian,

11
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,940
don't you know the age we are living in?

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,340
You still want to flee to Hong Kong.

13
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,980
Hongjun.

14
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,900
Hongjun.

15
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,780
It's been three days.

16
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,460
Well, I've finished them.

17
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,300
I've checked them.

18
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,100
Excellent.

19
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
It even surpassed the progress.

20
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,660
Your foundation is good.

21
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,540
Just so so.

22
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,420
Get ready. Let's go out.

23
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
Where are we going?

24
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,300
Have some good food, donkey burgers,

25
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,900
as a reward for your hard work.

26
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,420
OK.

27
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,580
(I just want to)

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
(entrust you with He Hongling, Heizi,)

29
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,260
(and all my men before I leave.)

30
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,020
(Didn't you ask me
whether I have any other relatives?)

31
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,820
(If I must say I have,
it is He Hongling.)

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,460
(Now Hongling has a crush on you.)

33
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,580
(You should love her back)

34
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,860
（and shouldn't let her love
be unrequited.）

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Can you see it?

36
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,300
Yes.

37
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,580
But I don't know this word. Another one.

38
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,660
This one.

39
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
This one. "Ren". "Ren".

40
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,180
It's "Ru".

41
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,820
Oh, my eyes.

42
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,180
Yes. Yes.

43
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,700
Tian.

44
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,060
Tian.

45
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,220
Tian.

46
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,260
Why isn't he at home again?

47
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,820
Heizi.

48
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,220
Cap-opener.

49
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,420
You haven't shown up for some days.

50
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,900
I've been busy.

51
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,940
Your brother is injured like this.

52
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,340
What have you been busy with?

53
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,340
I came now, right?

54
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,300
Why are you

55
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,940
so nervous?

56
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,060
Did anything happen?

57
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,100
Tian is missing.

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,540
No. No.

59
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,820
What do you mean missing?

60
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,700
I've gone to his home

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,740
these days,

62
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,620
but he wasn't at home.

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,580
I don't know where he went.

64
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,180
Was he kidnapped?

65
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,340
Well...

66
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,260
No, I'm going to look for him.

67
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,780
You're injured. Where are you going?

68
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,140
Tian is missing.

69
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,420
I have to do something.

70
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,860
You can't do anything.

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,860
Listen.

72
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,180
Someone can help us.

73
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,420
Cap-opener. What brings you here?

74
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,860
Heizi let me give you a message.

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,140
What is it?

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,620
Tian is missing.

77
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,260
As long as you find Tian,

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,460
you are even with Heizi.

79
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,100
Is Tian missing?

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,380
When?

81
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,860
It's been some days.

82
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,140
Let me ask you.

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,180
When did you know Tian got missing?

84
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,260
I went to his home these days,

85
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,860
but he hasn't been at home.

86
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,060
Chunsheng.

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,860
Chunsheng.

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,700
Something might have happened to Tian.

89
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Don't worry, Hongling.

90
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,700
Why do you think
something happened to him?

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,020
Yesterday was my birthday.

92
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,260
Tian said

93
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,620
he'd give me a birthday gift
before he left.

94
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
I waited all day yesterday
but he didn't show up.

95
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,180
Do you know

96
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,700
what the gift was?

97
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,460
He didn't say it,

98
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,820
but he knows I like tape recorders.

99
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I guess

100
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,700
it was an imported tape recorder.

101
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,020
An imported tape recorder?

102
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,260
Does he have any channel

103
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,620
to get that?

104
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,700
Chunsheng.

105
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,100
You may not know this.

106
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,220
These years,

107
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,580
with Tian

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,140
and his friend Qu from the south,

109
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,540
we've been scalping
imported tape recorder parts

110
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,780
and selling assembled products.

111
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,380
We made a lot of money.

112
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,980
Scalping imported tape recorder parts?

113
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,820
Scalping is illegal.

114
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,100
How did you dare to do that?

115
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,020
But we could make money from that.

116
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,860
Besides, that Qu

117
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,660
hasn't supplied parts for a long time.

118
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,460
I heard he has come back days ago.

119
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,060
I see.

120
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,780
Qi Tian told me he'd pick up goods

121
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,340
at Badachu in some days.

122
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,580
So it was about scalping.

123
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,700
I guess

124
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,860
he wanted to assemble a tape recorder

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,260
as a birthday gift for Hongling.

126
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,060
What should we do?

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,500
Did something happen to Tian

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,300
when he picked the goods?

129
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,460
Cap-opener. Let me ask you.

130
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,100
Does anyone else know Tian's business?

131
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,220
No, only my buddies know it.

132
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,140
It's Laosi.

133
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,020
A bloody underling of Li Shangyou.

134
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,260
I know who it is.

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,980
Who?

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,860
Li Shangyou.

137
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,540
Li Shangyou?

138
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,220
Are you so idle today?

139
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,340
What brings you here?

140
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,860
You should tell me earlier.

141
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,380
Then my brothers

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,420
could receive you well.

143
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,060
Didn't Qi Tian come?

144
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
People are saying that

145
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,620
he and you are

146
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,100
very intimate now.

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,460
Do you want to die?

148
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
Let me ask you something.

149
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,900
What is it? Say it.

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,620
Where were you five nights ago?

151
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,700
Drinking at my buddy's home.

152
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,260
You said it without thinking.

153
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,340
You remember so clearly

154
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,660
what happened five nights ago.

155
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,180
I have a good brain.

156
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,940
Let me ask you.

157
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,620
Who was that friend?

158
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,500
I don't have to tell you everything.

159
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,140
This is private.

160
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,180
Why should I tell you?

161
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,820
Li Shangyou. Stop pretending good.

162
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,260
It must be you.

163
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,420
Where is Tian?

164
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
Make it clear to me!

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,100
You are capable, huh?

166
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,340
Who do you think you are?

167
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,020
Well,

168
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,100
can you stop suspecting me?

169
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,460
I'm not the only enemy of Qi Tian.

170
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,140
He is naughty.

171
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,940
Maybe he's in jail now.

172
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
How do you know he is in jail?

173
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,860
He did many bad things.

174
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,780
Any of them can

175
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,420
get him into jail.

176
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,340
Where is Tian?

177
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,220
Where is Tian?

178
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,740
I don't know.

179
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm asking you again.

180
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Where is Tian?

181
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
He is found! He is found!

182
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,980
Tian is found!

183
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,380
He is in the police station.

184
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,780
(The Beijing Criminal Police
cracked a major smuggling case.)

185
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,980
(Qi Tian, Qu Weidong and other suspects
were arrested.)

186
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,220
Stop looking. Stop looking.

187
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,020
The police are coming.

188
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,260
Go. Go. Go.

189
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,100
Leave. Leave.

190
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,580
Stop looking.

191
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,540
Go. Go. Go.

192
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,820
They are out. They are out.

193
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
(Smuggler Zhang Bingwang)

194
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,780
Well done.

195
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,620
Well... Well...

196
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,060
These profiteers.

197
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,940
I won't take it. Get it back.

198
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,220
Come back.

199
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,460
I'm a hooligan

200
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,740
in people's eyes,

201
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,060
but I can definitely do what I say.

202
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,820
Rest assured.

203
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,580
I will never force you

204
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,700
to do anything you dislike

205
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,860
or you don't want to do.

206
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,420
But before you

207
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,820
decide to date someone,

208
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,860
you shouldn't refuse my kindness.

209
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,660
Take it.

210
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,380
I'm getting more and more confused

211
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,060
about your attitude.

212
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,260
In the past three years,

213
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,300
the only thing I have been doing

214
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,860
is thinking about you.

215
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,580
You need to say nothing.

216
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,700
I know whatever you are thinking.

217
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,540
It's not necessary for me to ask.

218
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,580
Is that true?

219
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,900
Isn't it?

220
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,820
Maybe.

221
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,140
(Clock Repair)

222
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,420
(Spring came as snow melted away.)

223
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,860
(Another year passed.)

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,900
(Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought)

(After Qi Tian left,)

226
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,060
(Xiao Chunsheng assumed
the role of Qi Tian)

227
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,740
(to look after He Hongling silently.)

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,740
(Ye Guohua was still expecting)

229
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,660
(to join the army with Xiao Chunsheng
this year,)

230
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,660
(but he was reluctant to
leave He Hongling too.)

231
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,540
(He felt)

232
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,740
(she was getting away from him, though.)

233
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,100
(Chen Hongjun was gradually
forgetting about Heizi.)

234
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,540
(His feelings for Ye Fang)

235
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,620
(was quietly emerging.)

236
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,900
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

237
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,940
Fang.

238
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,100
Hurry. Get in the car.

239
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm looking for you.

240
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,540
Come on. Hurry.

241
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,980
Chen Tao?

242
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,260
Hurry. Get in the car.

243
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
I told you not to send cars, didn't I?

244
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,380
Yes, but my mother wouldn't listen.

245
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,220
And today is special.

246
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,700
Commander He from Guangzhou came.

247
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,780
A temporary home banquet
will be held at noon.

248
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
He asked to see you.

249
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,300
Oh, right.

250
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,740
Commander He was

251
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,260
the superior of your father.

252
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,100
I have something to do.

253
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,540
Look.

254
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,180
Put it off

255
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,260
no matter how important it is.

256
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,020
Mr. He rarely comes to Baoding.

257
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,900
You shouldn't disappoint him.

258
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Go. Go.

259
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,980

Put out the fire!

What's wrong?

270

Hongling, your house might be on fire!

271

Mom! Mom!

272

Come.

Come.

Ma'am, are you alright?

282
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,540
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you alright?

283
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,340
Are you alright?

284
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,700
- Hongling, where are you going?
- Hongling!

285
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,380
Ma'am, don't worry.

286
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Why did she go back?

287

Are you alright?

Why were you going inside?

293
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,460
What were you doing?

294
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,500
What if you didn't get out?

295
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,380
My father's photo

296
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,780
could have been burnt.

297
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,220
Ma'am.

298
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,020
Mom!

- Chunsheng.
- Hongling.

301
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,620
Go to get a tricycle for me.

302
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,460
My mother has a heart problem.
She's in danger.

303
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,220
I'll borrow it from Dong.

304
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,380
I'll be back soon.

305
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,340
How are you, Mrs. Feng?

306

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,460
- Guohua.
- How is she?

309
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,540
My mother is dying.

310
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,220
Get in the car.

311
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,740
OK.

312
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,700
Please give me a hand.

313
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,460
OK.

314
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,820
Thanks.

315
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,020
Excuse me. Excuse me.

316
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,060
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

317
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,140
Hongling, open the door.

318
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,680
Drive!

319

Excuse me. Excuse me.

320
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,620
How are you, ma'am?

321
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,180
He's coming. He's coming.

322
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,300
Sir, where are they?

323
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
A car drove them away.

(Silence  Emergency Room)

325
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,420
Hongling. Don't worry too much.

326
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,940
Your mother will be fine.

327
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,300
Mom.

328
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,260
Doctor, how is she?

329
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,980
The patient is out of danger.

330
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,140
Luckily, it was in time,

331
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,900
but she should be observed
in the hospital.

332
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,220
You may go through the formalities.

333
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,100
OK.

334
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,220
Thank you, doctor.

335
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,060
Guohua.

336
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,780
I have no money with me.

337
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,820
It's fine.

338
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,700
I have some. I'll go for it.

339
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,620
Doctor, how is she?

340
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,780
Take her to the ward.

341
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,660
That's all for details.

342
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,100
You won't understand it specifically.

343
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
That is to say,

344
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
my mother is in a stable condition,

345
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,700
and can leave the hospital soon,

346
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,820
but the illness is still serious

347
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,620
and can attack and kill her anytime.

348
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Only surgery can cure it.

349
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,780
Yes.

350
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Why doesn't she have the surgery

351
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,470
and leave the hospital
after full recovery?

352
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,130
Cardiac surgery has

353
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,010
high professional requirements
for a doctor.

354
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,960
In the country,

355
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
only Professor Su
who came back from abroad

356
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,520
can do it.

357
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
We can invite Professor Su then.

358
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
As a benevolent doctor,

359
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,960
he'd surely help us if we beg him.

360
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,240
Professor Su was in poor health
years ago.

361
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,480
He is old now.

362
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,240
His energy is limited

363
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,080
and he can only do
a few surgeries a year.

364
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,360
Patients all over the country
are all waiting in line.

365
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,240
It's hard to get a surgery from him.

366
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,020
Doctor,

367
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,620
without considering other factors,

368
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,300
do you suggest my mother

369
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,660
to have the surgery now?

370
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
The patient is weak,

371
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,660
but she is still young.

372
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,700
Her other organs and body functions

373
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,460
have no problem.

374
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,020
If the conditions are met,

375
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,540
a surgery should be done

376
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,460
to cure her illness and extend her life.

377
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
If choosing a conservative treatment,

378
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,740
she should be closely observed.

379
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,100
Hongling.

380
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
What do you think?

381
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,340
I don't know.

382
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,140
Don't worry too much.

383
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,460
Doctor said there is a way.

384
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,660
Or we can

385
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,700
pull some strings and have the surgery.

386
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,420
Easy for you to say.

387
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,260
Patients all over the country
are waiting in line.

388
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,300
Maybe I have an idea.

389
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,380
A comrade-in-arms of my father

390
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,660
is the leader of
the military medical university.

391
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,820
He knows all the hospitals in Beijing.

392
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,980
He might know

393
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,500
this Professor Su.

394
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,460
I'll tell my father when he gets back.

395
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,140
Don't you believe me?

396
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,940
Let's talk later.

397
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
I can't think clearly now.

398
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,700
But it cannot

399
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,820
be delayed.

400
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,220
The doctor said

401
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,780
that cardiac surgery is dangerous.

402
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,820
We should wait

403
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,420
if a proper doctor can't be found.

404
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
That's why I wanted
to talk to my father.

405
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,860
The surgery is not urgent.

406
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm worried

407
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
where Hongling should live at night.

408
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,260
Where can she get a room?

409
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,700
She might borrow a room smoothly.

410
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,980
The problem is that

411
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,260
she doesn't live just for one day.

412
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,900
I can live in a guesthouse.

413
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,100
Guesthouse?

414
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,380
No.

415
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,860
It's not safe for a girl

416
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,820
to live in a guesthouse alone.

417
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,860
Chunsheng.

418
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Do you have an empty room at home?

419
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,740
My father isn't at home.

420
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,780
His room has been empty.

421
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,860
Chunsheng. It's inconvenient
to be at your home.

422
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,500
Besides,

423
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,340
Yanqiu is also at home.

424
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,060
Isn't that good?

425
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,900
Girls can

426
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,780
take care of each other.

427
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,300
That sounds good,

428
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,020
but...

429
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,900
Hongling, what do you think?

430
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,420
Hongling, come in.

431
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,620
(Chunsheng: I went on a business trip.
Be good.  Yanqiu.)

432
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,340
Hongling.

433
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,580
My sister is on a business trip.

434
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,060
You can live in her room.

435
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,100
Use her toiletries

436
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,460
for now.

437
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,420
I'll buy you new ones tomorrow.

438
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,300
Come.

439
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
You've had a hard day today.

440
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,220
Wash up and go to rest early.

441
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,580
Mom.

442
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,300
Haven't you gone to sleep?

443
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
How can I sleep?

444
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,820
What's wrong?

445
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,140
What's wrong?

446
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,140
I should ask you.

447
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,460
Did you save someone today?

448
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,300
Wang told you, right?

449
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,260
Don't ask who told me.

450
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,180
I'm asking you.

451
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,060
It's her, right?

452
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,940
Mom, her house is on fire.

453
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,460
Her mother had a heart attack.

454
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,420
I ran into them and
sent them to the hospital.

455
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,340
Was that wrong?

456
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,660
I won't argue with you.

457
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,100
Anyway, it's a good thing

458
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
that you saved people.

459
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,940
Right?

460
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,940
I've discussed it with your father.

461
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,700
Now I officially inform you.

462
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,820
You'll go to Beidaihe next week

463
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,300
for pre-service training.

464
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,860
Hanging around in Beijing all day

465
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
is no good thing.

466
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,460
Look at yourself.

467
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,580
You should get some lessons.

468
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,340
(A comrade-in-arms of my father)

469
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,860
(is the leader of
the military medical university.)

470
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,420
He knows all the hospitals in Beijing.

471
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,820
I'll tell him

472
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,460
after he comes back.

473
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,900
Let's talk later.

474
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,540
(I can't think clearly now.)

475
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,260
Have some vegetables.

476
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,940
Hongling.

477
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,180
I told Guohua this yesterday.

478
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,900
When Heizi sent people to me before,

479
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,980
I told everyone these words.

480
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,340
It's no longer

481
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,140
the feudal era.

482
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,780
People are free to love.

483
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,660
Don't listen to anyone,

484
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,980
not to your parents,

485
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,380
to Tian, Guohua or me.

486
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,060
Just listen to yourself.

487
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,900
I... I used to

488
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,740
consider many people.

489
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,420
Tian.

490
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,940
Guohua.

491
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,820
Even Heizi and the others.

492
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,020
But recently,

493
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
especially what Tian said to me

494
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,820
before he got arrested,

495
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,580
I thought about it carefully.

496
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,140
I don't think that

497
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,140
everything he said is right.

498
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,580
He can't

499
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,060
just bring us together as he wants.

500
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
The key is...

501
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,180
What is the key?

502
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
The key is still on you.

503
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,860
Whether you hesitate now

504
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,940
or have concerns,

505
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,060
I can understand.

506
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,540
I don't want to put pressure on you.

507
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,900
Neither does Guohua.

508
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,940
You didn't know

509
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,300
ether of us before.

510
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,500
It's not bad to know us more.

511
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,220
I believe Guohua thinks the same.

512
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,860
So,

513
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,140
this thing

514
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,180
is up to you at last.

515
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,660
The two of us

516
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,900
will wait.

517
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,820
Chunsheng.

518
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,820
I know you two are both good to me.

519
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,540
I clearly know that.

520
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,820
I'm sorry

521
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
that I angered you

522
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,820
at the ice rink,

523
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,420
but my heart has never changed.

524
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,020
Chunsheng.

525
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
I think you understand.

526
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,580
It's late.

527
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
I'm going to visit my mother.

528
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,740
I'm going with you.

529
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,100
(Unit One)

530
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,540
Hongling.

531
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,700
Get on.

532
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,100
Let's go.

533
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,060
Guohua, what's the matter?

534
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,780
Dad. Mom.

535
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,660
I've decided it.

536
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,660
You're right.

537
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm not young.

538
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,140
I can't waste time like this.

539
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,900
I should be

540
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,460
committed to the army,

541
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,180
to learn and get trained.

542
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,860
I want to join the army
as soon as possible.

543
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,780
Good boy.

544
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Look, our son is promising.

545
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,300
I thought I heard him wrong.

546
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,540
It's our son, right?

547
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,100
I can speak for your father.

548
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,700
We agree.

549
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,500
But I have a condition.

550
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,340
Say it.

551
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,340
I want to go with Hongling together.

552
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,340
Dad. Mom.

553
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Hear me out first.

554
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,660
Hongling is

555
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,940
an excellent violinist.

556
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,300
She's gifted. She loves music.

557
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,220
She's been practicing since young
and has a solid foundation.

558
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,180
Her biggest dream is to join
an art troupe.

559
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,140
I believe

560
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,500
she'll become the best player

561
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,060
in the art troupe if she can go.

562
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,940
I hope to help her realize her dream.

563
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,460
This is also my biggest wish.

564
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,300
Guohua.

565
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,580
You know He Hongling's family.

566
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,500
It would be hard for her
to join the army.

567
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,980
I know, Dad.

568
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,460
But her father was wronged.

569
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,460
Besides,

570
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,340
Hongling is outstanding.

571
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,860
The army needs such professionals.

572
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,140
It doesn't matter.

573
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,940
It can't be in a hurry.

574
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,260
There is still one month left

575
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,180
after the Beidaihe training.

576
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,580
I'll wait.

577
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,780
When this is settled,

578
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,940
then we'll join the army together.

579
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,740
Dad. Mom. Do your business.

580
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,500
I'm going to my room.

581
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,820
Wait! You...

582
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,140
This kid.

583
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,380
Don't you understand?

584
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,740
This is an ultimatum.

585
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,940
(Be vigilant to defend our country)
Is it your idea to go to Beidaihe?

586
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,900
Yes.

587
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,860
Just to separate
your brother and Hongling?

588
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,540
They aren't together.
It's not separation.

589
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,700
I just want them to calm down.

590
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,740
Aren't you too nosy about this?

591
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,900
He is my brother.

592
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,140
I'm doing it for him.

593
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,540
Don't tell on me.

594
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,900
Or I'll punish you.

595
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,260
Fang.

596
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,580
Chen Tao.

597
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,940
I'm looking for you.

598
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,820
This is...

599
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,140
He is my relative, Chen Hongjun.

600
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,180
Hello. Hello.

601
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,300
My name is Chen Tao,

602
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,940
Ye Fang's fiance.

603
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,420
Hello, I'm Chen Hongjun.

604
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,660
Hello. Hello.

605
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,340
Hongjun, you may go back first.

606
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,540
OK. I'm going then.

607
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,900
By the way, Fang.

608
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,460
I've been studying Lesson 19.

609
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,020
Lesson 19?

610
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,900
There are two lessons missing.

611
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,500
I intended to bring them to you
in two days.

612
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,860
It wouldn't be delayed.

613
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,100
OK.

614
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,820
Are you preparing for
the college entrance exam?

615
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,660
Yes.

616
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,540
There is no such exam.
Do you know it?

617
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,700
I know.

618
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,060
But

619
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,060
Ye Fang said there would be one.

620
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
Do you believe everything she says?

621
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,420
Yes.

622
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,820
That's good.

623
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,180
You must be very idle then.

624
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,900
Hongjun, aren't you leaving?

625
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,180
Fine.

626
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,940
I'm going back then.

627
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,580
What are you doing here?

628
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,380
I'm here to invite you

629
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,860
to lunch at my home on the weekend.

630
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,860
No. I have something to do.

631
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,740
What is it?

632
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,540
Going to your old house

633
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,980
to see this Chen...

634
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
Chen Hongjun.

635
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Chen Hongjun.

636
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,140
What relative is he to you?

637
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,900
You've never mentioned him before.

638
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,540
He is my brother's classmate.

639
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,980
No wonder.

640
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,980
No wonder what?

641
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,900
Ye Fang.

642
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,340
I think you should be cautious

643
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,540
to make friends.

644
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,020
My brother and he were
primary school classmates.

645
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,580
We've known each other since childhood.

646
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,460
Your brother's classmate?

647
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,060
Wouldn't there be a problem?

648
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,820
What do you mean?

649
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,700
I heard that

650
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,700
Guohua was unwilling to join the army

651
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,060
and always hung out

652
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,020
with some bad friends.

653
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,420
He often fought with others.

654
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,060
Chen Tao.

655
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,140
Hongjun and my brother are good people.

656
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,100
Don't listen to the nonsense.

657
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,660
Why did he come to Baoding then?

658
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,380
He...

659
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,780
To review lessons in a quiet place.

660
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,300
To go to a college?

661
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,460
Is it your idea?

662
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,220
Yeah.

663
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,860
Hey.

664
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,380
Why does he believe everything you say?

665
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,660
You don't believe me, but someone does.

666
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,540
He is so good and listens to you.

667
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,900
Why aren't you together with him?

668
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,580
Fang. I didn't mean that.

669
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,500
Fang.

670
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,220
Mr. Niu.

671
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,180
Chunsheng.

672
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,180
Hello.

673
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,500
Xiao Chunsheng, right?

674
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,460
Yes, I am.

675
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,140
Who are you?

676
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,620
I'm Xu, director of
the Political Department.

677
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,660
The member of your father's task force.

678
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,460
My father... He...

679
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,140
What happened to him?

680
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,700
Mr. Xiao Yanpei had
a cerebral infarction last night.

681
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,380
He's been sent to Hospital 301.

682
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,460
Wait. What did you say?

683
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,380
Chunsheng.

684
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,660
The doctor is asking for you.

685
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,700
Delivery and rescue were timely.

686
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,140
The patient is out of danger.

687
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,300
Now,

688
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,820
the functions of his body are
recovering well.

689
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,700
He can leave the hospital in a few days.

690
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,700
Thank you, doctor.

691
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Chunsheng.

692
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,540
Considering your father's
physical condition,

693
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,020
the organization decides

694
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,860
to stop the isolation review of him.

695
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,940
After the treatment,

696
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,580
you can take him home

697
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,860
and look after him.

698
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,180
Really?

699
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,780
Do you mean

700
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,740
my father's thing is settled?

701
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,580
Not yet.

702
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,740
But I believe

703
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,900
the organization will conclude it soon.

704
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,940
Rest assured.

705
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,940
Wait patiently for a while.

706
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,820
Thanks.

707
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,900
Thanks for the organization's care.

708
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,780
Thanks.

709
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,540
Did your father

710
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,820
have symptoms like amnesia?

711
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,860
Yes, sometimes he thought he was

712
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,860
still in the time of the liberation war.

713
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,460
He is old,

714
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,260
and had a stroke.

715
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,260
After he leaves the hospital,

716
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,420
the intermittent amnesia

717
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,900
and cognitive disorder may intensify.

718
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,340
He might forget you completely.

719
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,740
Be mentally prepared for that.

720
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,780
Don't worry.

721
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,420
We can surely take good care of him.

722
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,300
Who?

723
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,260
Thanks.

724
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,220
You're welcome.

725
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,380
Hongling.

726
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,780
Guohua.

727
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,460
Here you are.

728
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,540
How is he?

729
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,020
He's been out of danger.

730
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,340
That's good.

731
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,860
Have you visited your mother?

732
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,940
Yes. Just now.

733
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,060
The nurse you arranged
for my mother is good.

734
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,180
Thank you very much.

735
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,580
No thanks between us.

736
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,060
Well.

737
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,820
I contacted a nursing home
for your mother.

738
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,020
She can recuperate there.

739
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm also contacting Professor Su.

740
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,340
Once I contact him,

741
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,180
your mother can have the surgery.

742
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,940
Guohua.

743
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,780
Thanks for what you did

744
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,620
for my mother.

745
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,100
Again.

746
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,780
I said no thanks.

747
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,020
Oh, Hongling.

748
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,100
I'm going to Beidaihe

749
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,620
for the pre-service training.

750
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,580
Before I go,

751
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,340
I want to ask you something.

752
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,580
What is it?

753
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,380
Do you want to join the army

754
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,820
and go to the art troupe?

755
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,740
I'm going. They're urging me.

756
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,060
Think about it.

757
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,300
Xiaomei. How to use this?

758
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Let me do it.

759
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,820
Can it be sold?

760
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,940
No. Blood pressure monitors
are in short supply.

761
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,820
No hospital can sell it.

762
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,540
How about this?

763
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm preparing for an exam.

764
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,820
I can use these instruments

765
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,260
once a week.

766
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,620
I can go to your home

767
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,700
and treat your father once a week,

768
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,220
as long as you trust my medical skills.

769
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,420
We trust you.

770
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,300
You are Doctor Tong.

771
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Dad. Slowly.

772
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,300
Come on.

773
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,500
Officer!

774
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,580
Yes!

775
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,580
What's this place?

776
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,660
Sir.

777
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,180
This is your bedroom.

778
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,620
Nonsense!

779
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,900
Why do I have such a nice bedroom?

780
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,500
There should be unity
between officers and soldiers.

781
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,100
We are now in wartime.

782
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,180
Everything must be simplified.

783
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,820
You just don't listen to me.

784
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,340
Sorry, sir.

785
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,300
I made a mistake.

786
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,020
This isn't your bedroom.

787
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,900
It's the Battle Command Room.

788
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,660
I put a bed here

789
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,260
so that you can take a rest
when you get tired.

790
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,620
Replace it with a marching bed.

791
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,460
Yes.

792
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,620
Officer Ye, what should we do now?

793
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,220
There's no choice.

794
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,580
That's an order.

795
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,220
Obey it.

796
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,340
(Prop Workshop)
Chunsheng. You come in time.

797
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,580
We just shot a film.

798
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,340
These are all what you want.

799
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,860
Thanks. Thanks.

800
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,260
This is a great help.

801
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,860
My father is the same.

802
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,860
He always

803
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,620
sees the camp map

804
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,140
or the warfare map,

805
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,340
for an hour each time.

806
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
In his mind, all are

807
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,020
"gallant and formidable warriors,

808
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,860
how thick with salient days
the bygone times appear".

809
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,140
So is my father.

810
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,860
He's too obsessed.

811
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,060
See it as medicine.

812
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,580
When the old man is happy,

813
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,700
he'll be fine.

814
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,660
Buddy, take this.

815
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,420
Chunsheng.

816
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,820
What are you doing?

817
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,980
I help you,

818
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,580
because Wang Yan said

819
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,660
you are a loyal friend.

820
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,860
And you have filial piety.

821
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,660
I don't care about this.

822
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,740
Please, take it.

823
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,700
Chunsheng, don't do this.

824
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,860
Get it back.

825
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,340
Or I won't lend you these things.

826
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,340
What should I say?

827
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,660
Say nothing.

828
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,060
I'm leaving then.

829
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
- OK. Thanks.
- Thanks.

830
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,180
Thank you.

831
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,900
You're welcome.

832
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,340
Chunsheng, it's done.

833
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,800
OK. Go home.
