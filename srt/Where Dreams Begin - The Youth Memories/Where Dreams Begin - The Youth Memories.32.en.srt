=Episode 32=

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,280
Most family members of the patients

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,520
know nothing about rehabilitation.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
Chunsheng, look at this kid.

6
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,040
He broke his leg not long ago,

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,600
but now, just after half a month,

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,120
his family can't afford
the treatment anymore.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,760
If they take him back home,

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't know when

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,240
he can stand up again.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
What a poor boy.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,160
Here.

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,800
Take it.

15
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
Thank you.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Hey, how did you get hurt?

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,680
I climbed a tree for bird eggs,

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
and then I fell from it.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,760
Look at you.

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,600
You have to make sure you don't fall
before you climb a tree,

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,360
You have to pick
old and thick trees to climb.

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,360
Do you understand?

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
Yes.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
I just don't know

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
if I will be able to climb trees again.

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Why not?

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,520
You are not gonna continue training?

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
My mother said it's useless,

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
so I might as well go home.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,080
Then tell me,

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
what do you think?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
I think it's useful.

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,440
It would be nice
to have training equipment at home.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,640
Dongzi, don't lose heart.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,560
Just keep practicing the moves

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,440
I taught you before,

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
you will definitely recover.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
When I have time,

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,880
I will go to your home
to give you acupuncture.

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,280
Thank you, Dr. Tong.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,960
It seems that you are not good at Go.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,440
Mr. Tong,

43
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
how can my Go skills compare with yours?

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,320
Chunsheng,

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
it's been more than a year now.

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Xiaomei told me

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,360
that you made a lot of money

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
through your jewelry and jade business.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
When you told me

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
you were going to start a business,

51
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
I thought you were bragging.

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Now you have really done it.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Mr. Tong,

54
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,520
my friends helped me with that.

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't claim all the credits.

56
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,960
When did you become so humble?

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,070
Xiaomei often

58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,320
tells me about your business.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,070
She said that your friend, Xiang Nan,

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
is in charge of purchasing,

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
and you are in charge of
opening the market in Beijing.

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,440
You two are a very good team.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,560
And your brother-in-law

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,760
also helped you a lot.

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,200
It seems that you have good partners.

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,640
You are all doing things

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
you are good at.

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
We still have a lot to learn.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,400
I've never done business in my life,

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,920
so I have no advice for you.

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,760
But all the things in this world

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
have something in common.

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
There's a sentence you need to remember.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
Virtue comes first,

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,520
and interests come last.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,040
Mr. Tong,

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,920
although you haven't done business,

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
you know

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
the truth of it.

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
That is great advice.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I have to learn more from you
in the future.

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,920
OK, now that you think it's right,

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,720
I'll just say one more thing.

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Please go ahead.

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,000
You have money now,

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
so remember,

87
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
you must use your money right.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,760
Mr. Tong,

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
that's just what I'm thinking about!

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,840
Looks like

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,920
you already have a plan in your mind.

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
I do.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,600
I'll tell you more about it
when it takes shape.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,360
OK.

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's play.

96
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
I surrender.

97
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,960
Come on, let's have another game.

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,280
- OK.
- One more game.

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,240
Come on.

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,160
Xiaomei,

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
while your dad and I were playing Go,

102
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,440
he said something to me.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,640
He said,

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
“You have money now,

105
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
so remember,

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
you must use your money right.”

107
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
You already have a plan, right?

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,640
You know me so well.

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I have been planning it for some time.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,720
I would like

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
to do something for the rehab center.

112
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,120
I want to get
some medical equipment for it.

113
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,720
I think it's a good idea

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
and it's also very meaningful.

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
But

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
where can we get
the medical equipment from?

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
When I tried to buy

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,280
the electromagnetic instrument
from abroad,

119
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
Li Shangyou tried to stop me.

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
Can we only buy it from abroad

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
through the shopping malls?

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Currently,
foreign rehabilitation equipment

123
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,080
are more mature than domestic ones.

124
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,240
We can only buy them from abroad,

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
but I don't think we have to buy them

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
through the shopping malls.

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,760
You have a way?

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,120
No, I don't.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,760
But I know someone who does.

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,640
Xiaomei, you mean

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,720
I should go to Chen Hongjun?

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Forget it.

133
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
I have lost contact with Guohua

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
and Hongjun for a long time.

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
I take him as a brother,

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,560
but

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
we are not the same kind of people.

138
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
You don't have to go to him

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
if you're doing it for yourself,

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,200
but this time,

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
it's not just for yourself.

142
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,600
Moreover,

143
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
Heizi's matter

144
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,200
was indeed Chen Hongjun's fault.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
What are you guilty of?

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,440
He is the one who should feel guilty
and dare not see you.

147
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
You have a point.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,640
But I know him well,

149
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
I don't think he will help me.

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,840
It'll be a waste of effort.

151
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,720
You can't control what he does,

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
but you need to do what you should do.

153
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,160
Besides,

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
that's the fastest way to get news

155
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,320
I can think of right now.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
If that doesn't work,

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,880
we'll think of other ways.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
OK, I'll do that.

159
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Maybe

160
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,280
I should go talk to Chen Hongjun now.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,150
Do you want me to come with you?

162
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,120
No need.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
This is between me and him.

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,910
Do not worry.

165
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,560
Chunsheng?

166
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
Come on in.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,480
OK.

168
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
Sit down.

169
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Come on, sit down.

170
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Here, have some tea.

171
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,120
Here.

172
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,600
I heard you made a fortune

173
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,720
through jewelry business.

174
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,360
I was just thinking I should

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
go to your place
and congratulate you later.

176
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,240
It's not that good.

177
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
Tell me

178
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,880
why are you here today?

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Just say it,

180
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll definitely help you if I can.

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
Actually, I still feel sorry for

182
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,800
what happened
at the Anti-smuggling Squad.

183
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Really.

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,960
Ye Fang is still blaming me.

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Hongjun, don't say that.

186
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Otherwise,
I don't know how to talk to you.

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,600
I don't want you to feel that you owe me.

188
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Everyone has their own difficulties

189
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
in their specific places.

190
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
I understand.

191
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
I mean it.

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
It's great that you understand.

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,920
Hongjun,

194
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm here today

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,440
to ask you something.

196
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
I want to buy
some rehabilitation equipment

197
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
for the rehab center.

198
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,440
I wonder if you have a purchase channel.

199
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,560
I see.

200
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
Good rehabilitation equipment now

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,240
are all imported ones.

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,400
They are hard to get.

203
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,960
I was thinking

204
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,160
since you work at the Customs,

205
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
you might have a special channel.

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,960
Or maybe you have some way

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
to help me contact foreign manufacturers.

208
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,080
This is a little difficult.

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,520
In that case, Hongjun,

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
forget about it.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,640
How about this?

212
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,400
Earlier, Ye Fang told me that her college

213
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
has opportunities for foreign exchange.

214
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll ask her

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
to see if she can help me.

216
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,480
Chunsheng, well,

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,240
Ye Fang has been busy recently.

218
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,760
Actually, in recent years,

219
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,560
our domestic market is increasingly
valued by foreign countries,

220
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
especially about the medical equipment.

221
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,000
Our production capacity is insufficient,

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
and our demand is big.

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
They are all coveting this market.

224
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,240
Yes.

225
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
Even if we don't go to them,

226
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,520
they will do everything they can

227
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,240
to open an office here.

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,600
How about this?

229
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Tomorrow,

230
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
I'll take you somewhere.

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,120
I believe you can find
what you're looking for.

232
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,680
But their quality

233
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,040
is quite a mixed bag.

234
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,320
You need to keep your eyes open.

235
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,640
If you make a wrong choice,

236
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
the quality is really not guaranteed.

237
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Don't worry.

238
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,640
There's no problem.

239
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
Hongjun, thank you.

240
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,920
I knew you'd have a way.

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
Don't worry about it.

242
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Xiaomei is not home today.

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
So we are alone.

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,200
I'll cook some dishes,

245
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,800
stay and have dinner with me.

246
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,760
I have a good bottle of liquor.

247
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,640
Let's have a drink.

248
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't bother.

249
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,640
Xiaomei is waiting for me at home.

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
I can't have dinner here.

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,640
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

252
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,800
I have to go now.

253
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,520
All right then.

254
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,520
See you tomorrow.

255
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,960
OK.

256
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,720
- I'll see you off.
- Goodbye.

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,440
Don't bother.

258
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,040
It's not necessary.

259
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
See you tomorrow.

260
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,320
Bye.

261
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
(Kangle Medical Equipment Company)

262
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,000
Is this the place?

263
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,400
Let's take a look.

264
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,240
Hello.

265
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,960
- Hello
- How can I help you?

266
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll just look around.

267
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,680
Please continue what you were doing.

268
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,040
I'll call you if I need help.

269
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,280
No problem.

270
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you.

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,360
Hongjun,

272
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
I really didn't expect that

273
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
there were some
medical equipment stores like this.

274
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,320
Listen, Chunsheng,

275
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,600
this is the benefit
brought by reform and opening up.

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Right now,

277
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,160
the production
of domestic medical equipment

278
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,400
is a little backward.

279
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
But our standards for treating diseases

280
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
and saving lives can't go backward.

281
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,600
That's why

282
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,200
we can only rely on
imported medical equipment right now.

283
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
It's that simple?

284
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,280
They can just sell

285
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,840
the advanced medical devices

286
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,400
from abroad directly?

287
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
How is that possible?

288
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,880
Medical devices are not vegetables.

289
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,320
I tell you.

290
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,280
For any

291
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,120
medical device entering China,

292
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,720
the manufacturer or its agent

293
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
must submit a market access application

294
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
to the relevant government department,

295
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,440
and must obtain a nationally standardized

296
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,760
registration certificate
and registration number.

297
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,440
Now the medical devices
in our domestic market

298
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,840
are quite a mixed bag.

299
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,400
The government doesn't have
enough energy to supervise it.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
So in terms of quality,

301
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,360
you have to keep your eyes open.

302
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,440
Be careful with it.

303
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Hongjun.

304
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,400
Hongjun.

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
The agent you talked about,

306
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,480
what is it?

307
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,080
Agent?

308
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
The agent is the person who finds a way

309
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
to sell the medical devices produced

310
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,920
by manufacturers to the hospital.

311
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
Think about it.

312
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,520
There are so many hospitals

313
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,080
in Beijing and all across the country,

314
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,320
the manufacturers
can't contact all of them.

315
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,360
That's why they need agents.

316
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
Look.

317
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,120
Why can't many hospitals

318
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,760
buy the medical equipment

319
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,800
they want?

320
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
This is
because of information asymmetry.

321
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
The buyer can't find the seller,

322
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
and vice versa.

323
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,880
So,

324
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,920
the agents are a key role in this.

325
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,080
Just take another look.

326
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
OK, that makes sense.

327
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,800
There must be something you want.

328
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Sir, do you have
electromagnetic instruments?

329
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
I mean the ones
for rehabilitation therapies.

330
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,840
How many do you want?

331
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Ten.

332
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
Who are you going to sell them to?

333
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
I won't sell them.

334
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
I'll donate them to the rehab center.

335
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,080
We also have other kinds
of rehabilitation equipment,

336
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
like medium frequency
pulse therapeutic apparatus

337
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
and far infrared therapeutic device,

338
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,480
everything.

339
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,480
You have all those?

340
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Then do you have rehabilitation bed?

341
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
And rehab stretchers or something?

342
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,360
Not here,

343
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,520
we have samples in our warehouse.

344
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
If you want them,

345
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,840
we'll purchase them from abroad

346
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
according to your requirements.

347
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,520
OK.

348
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Can we go to the warehouse now?

349
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,720
Of course. It's not far away.

350
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
- OK.
- Let's go.

351
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
Come on.

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Director Chen?

353
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Why didn't you tell me you'd come?

354
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,720
Director Ma.

355
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,400
Is this an official or private matter?

356
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,280
Lunch is on me.

357
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,440
Let's

358
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
have lunch together.

359
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,280
It's not that I'm turning you down.

360
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,040
It's just a private matter.

361
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,240
Today,

362
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm just here
to have a look with my friend.

363
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
He needs some rehabilitation equipment.

364
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,600
Please help him out.

365
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
No problem.

366
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,480
You are Director Chen's friend.

367
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,320
May I have your name?

368
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,360
What do you do?

369
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,520
My name is Xiao Chunsheng.

370
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,600
I just

371
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,560
do some

372
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,440
small business.

373
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Alright, Director Chen's friend

374
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
is also my friend.

375
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,520
Come to me directly if you need anything.

376
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,280
Here.

377
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,760
Director Chen,
you don't need to do this in person.

378
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,680
I will accompany you.

379
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,800
I guarantee that

380
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
you'll get quality stuff

381
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,800
with a low price.

382
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

383
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,320
I won't bother you today, Mr. Ma.

384
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,840
We are leaving.

385
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,720
We'll just go to their warehouse.

386
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,320
Liu, this is a good chance for you.

387
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
You must give them quality stuff

388
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
with a low price.

389
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,280
Got it?

390
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
Of course, Director Ma.

391
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,120
Remember,
come to me if you need something.

392
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,600
All right, Mr. Ma.

393
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,080
OK. See you around.

394
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,360
Just come to me,

395
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Director Ma.

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,520
You two are well connected.

397
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
You know not only
the director of the rehab center,

398
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,360
but also some national cadres.

399
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,400
Will you consider to be an agent for me?

400
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
For an agent, connections
are the most important.

401
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,800
This is our

402
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
first time here,

403
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,840
and you are

404
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,600
already giving us jobs.

405
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,600
Come on.

406
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,200
Let's finish what we came for first.

407
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,680
OK.

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go.

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,240
Let's go.

410
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,760
Chunsheng,

411
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
I was shocked when you told me.

412
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,720
Where did you get so much equipment?

413
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,080
A friend of mine at the Customs
introduced me a channel.

414
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
Director, do you know that

415
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,520
there is a small medical equipment market

416
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,800
in Beijing?

417
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,040
You have helped us a lot!

418
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,520
I have told the finance department

419
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
to get the money ready.

420
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
We'll pay for them.

421
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,640
No, Director,

422
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,920
please don't do this.

423
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,200
I made some money by opening a shop.

424
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,000
I just want to help

425
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,880
our rehab center.

426
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,560
I'll just donate those devices to you.

427
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,240
No way!

428
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,720
Business is business.

429
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm already very happy that you can

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,480
come visit us from time to time.

431
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,240
You did us such a great favor.

432
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
If you refuse to take the money,

433
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,960
we can't accept your equipment.

434
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
You can take them back now.

435
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,240
Well, you...

436
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,080
Alright then.

437
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,680
I'll take the money.

438
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,400
You must help us

439
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
with our equipment procurement
from now on.

440
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,960
And you must get paid for that.

441
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,280
Alright, whatever you say.

442
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,480
Tell me if you need anything, Director.

443
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,120
Alright,

444
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,920
I need to go now.

445
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,960
See you around.

446
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,360
Xiaomei.

447
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,600
It's done?

448
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,960
Of course.

449
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,560
Chen Hongjun

450
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,040
took me to a medical equipment store.

451
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,440
I really didn't expect that

452
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,560
there was a place like that in Beijing.

453
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,160
Although it doesn't have

454
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,960
everything we need,

455
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
it has most of them.

456
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,760
Take me there

457
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,960
when I have time.

458
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,280
OK, no problem.

459
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,880
Xiaomei,

460
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,880
after going to that place today,

461
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,120
I have an idea.

462
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,480
I want to be a medical device agent.

463
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,400
Medical device agents

464
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
transfer the products

465
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,680
of foreign medical equipment companies

466
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,560
to China through some channels,

467
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
and sell them to domestic hospitals,

468
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
and make money out of it.

469
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
What about your jade shop?

470
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,920
I just ran that jade shop

471
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
to do Xiang Nan a favor.

472
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,840
Yes,

473
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
I like jade,

474
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,040
but I don't want that to be my job.

475
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,800
And let me tell you,

476
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
the domestic medical device market

477
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,680
is just emerging.

478
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,400
I want to be a pioneer in this industry.

479
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,080
Xiaomei, listen to me.

480
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,120
I've been

481
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,040
thinking about it for a long time.

482
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
I can learn if there's
something I don't understand.

483
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,680
And this industry is just emerging,

484
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,000
I can totally grow with this industry.

485
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Xiaomei,

486
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,400
listen.

487
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,200
I went to Kunming some time ago

488
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,640
and visited Duan Lei.

489
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,040
His condition

490
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,680
is much better than those veterans.

491
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
He can walk and jump.

492
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,800
It's just that he can't sleep well

493
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,920
because of that steel nail in his leg.

494
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
I've been thinking,

495
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
if we could get some

496
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,440
imported medical devices,

497
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,600
then Duan Lei

498
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
and those people in the rehab center,

499
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
even more people we don't know

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,040
will have a better chance

501
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,000
of recovery.

502
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Hey.

503
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,360
Why are you smiling?

504
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

505
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
you always think differently.

506
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,360
Xiaomei, you know

507
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,880
I was almost paralyzed.

508
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,040
If you hadn't

509
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
gotten those imported medical equipment,

510
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,800
and invented new
rehabilitation training methods for me,

511
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,360
I wouldn't have stood up

512
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
to live a normal life.

513
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,480
You are flattering me.

514
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
I'm telling the truth.

515
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
I'm not flattering you.

516
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,200
Not everyone has the luck to meet you

517
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
like I did.

518
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,440
I can't be the only lucky one.

519
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,480
I have to try

520
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,960
no matter what.

521
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,240
Believe me.

522
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I already said that

523
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
I'd support you

524
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
whatever you do.

525
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
- Nan.
- Come on.

526
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,080
Nan,

527
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,200
our business is now on the right track.

528
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,240
You are in charge of delivery in Kunming,

529
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,440
and my brother-in-law has taken over

530
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,200
the communication with BACC Service.

531
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Oh,

532
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,240
your brother-in-law, Qi Tian,

533
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,160
is such a genius

534
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,720
in dealing with people.

535
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,040
He can make friends

536
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,480
with anybody in a short time.

537
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,440
He's better than you at this.

538
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,720
Of course.

539
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,080
Qi Tian

540
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,480
was a big figure in Beijing.

541
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,000
He is a man of loyalty and rules,

542
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
and is easy to get along with.

543
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,040
You made a right decision

544
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,560
by entrusting your business to him.

545
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,840
It's just a piece of cake

546
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
for him.

547
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,160
And it won't take up much of his time.

548
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
He just needs to call
the contact person of BACC Service

549
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,240
once a month.

550
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,120
Everyone

551
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,680
has something they are good at doing.

552
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,080
If you let me deal with those people,

553
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,280
I won't even know

554
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,160
what to say.

555
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,360
- Come on.
- Come on.

556
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,840
By the way,

557
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Yanqiu, your sister,

558
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
is so good at financial work.

559
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,440
Since she took charge of

560
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,320
the communication with BACC
about financial matters,

561
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,560
the accounts

562
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,960
became so well-organized.

563
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,600
Nan, maybe you don't know.

564
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,720
My sister has worked hard for it.

565
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,800
She read a lot of books on finance

566
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
late at night.

567
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,280
With their help,

568
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
you will be more at ease.

569
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,440
You are also quite at ease.

570
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,960
Look,

571
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm in charge of delivery,
and your brother-in-law, sales,

572
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
your sister, finance.

573
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
You don't need to do anything.

574
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Come on, Nan.

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,840
Come on.

576
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,440
A toast to you.

577
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,040
Come on.

578
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,960
Nan,

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
I want to tell you about something.

580
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,880
Do you have any new ideas?

581
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Yes.

582
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,840
I want to be

583
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,560
a rehab equipment agent.

584
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,160
Rehab equipment?

585
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,440
Chunsheng,

586
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
can you tell me

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
why you want to do that?

588
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,760
I learned how hard rehabilitation is,

589
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,360
and how long it takes

590
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,640
after experiencing it myself.

591
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
Not only do you need
someone to take care of you,

592
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
but also a scientific method.

593
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,240
If you train improperly,

594
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,160
you might never stand up again.

595
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,240
So I was thinking,

596
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,840
if the rehabilitation equipment

597
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,920
were not so scarce,

598
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,960
then more people would be able

599
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
to stand up.

600
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,960
I understand now.

601
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,480
What you want to do is to help others.

602
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
You don't care about money at all.

603
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm not that noble.

604
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If your products are good,

605
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,600
you can naturally make money.

606
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,920
I didn't think so much.

607
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,440
Chunsheng,

608
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,800
I know you're a special person.

609
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Most people now

610
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,840
only think about making money,

611
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,960
but you

612
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,200
are thinking about helping others.

613
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
You are really admirable.

614
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,800
Come on, a toast to you.

615
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Come on.

616
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,760
In fact, Nan,

617
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm not that great.

618
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Actually, now,

619
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,600
only few people are involved

620
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,400
in domestic medical device industry.

621
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,600
The future market is very broad.

622
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
The sooner I start,

623
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
the greater advantage I'll get.

624
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,440
I don't want to wait any longer.

625
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,800
I asked you out this time

626
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
just to ask

627
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
if you want to do it with me.

628
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
It is not my area of expertise.

629
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,600
The stores I'm running

630
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,960
are already keeping me busy.

631
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Besides,

632
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm not as noble as you.

633
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,160
Maybe you should help others alone.

634
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
Alright, Nan.

635
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
I just want to tell you about it.

636
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,440
But don't worry.

637
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,800
Whatever I do

638
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,960
will not affect our business.

639
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,960
I trust you.

640
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,200
Come on, Chunsheng.

641
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,160
I wish you success in your new business.

642
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,920
Come on.

643
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,740
(Unit One)

644
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,840
You have decided?

645
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
Yes.

646
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,640
Originally, I just wanted to do something
for the rehab center,

647
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,440
but after learning so much today,

648
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,440
I realize
that the market for medical devices

649
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,680
is so broad.

650
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,000
Tian,

651
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,560
I'm really optimistic about this market.

652
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
But a start-up capital is required

653
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,680
to be an agent
of imported medical equipment.

654
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,880
Yanqiu, I've already thought about it.

655
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,680
We have made a lot of money

656
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,800
through the jewelry and jade business.

657
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,200
And

658
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,360
I have told Nan that

659
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
our business in Beijing will continue.

660
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,280
Anyway,
the business is on the right track.

661
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,160
We have enough time

662
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,000
and energy to explore
new business opportunities.

663
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,840
Besides,

664
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,800
this is what I want to do.

665
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,920
If you really want to do it,

666
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,840
I'm gonna do it with you.

667
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Tian, to be honest,

668
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,320
I can't do it without you.

669
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,720
Xiang Nan can help me
with my jewelry business,

670
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,160
but I have no helper
in the medical device business.

671
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,720
I can only count on you.

672
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
But I suddenly remember

673
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,600
what Xiaomei told me some time ago.

674
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,200
She told Ye Fang what I thought.

675
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,280
Ye Fang was willing to join us.

676
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,200
It would be better if she could join us.

677
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,000
She is a college teacher, she knows a lot.

678
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,320
I was a little worried about this,

679
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,160
but if Fang can join us,

680
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I will be more at ease.

681
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,000
Since we are talking about this,

682
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,760
I also have something to say.

683
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,240
Cap-opener, Cap, Xiaoliu and Xiang Dong

684
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,440
came to me several times recently.

685
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
What for?

686
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,880
What do you think?

687
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,040
They blame me.

688
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, you know,

689
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
actually they don't blame me,

690
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
they blame you.

691
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,440
You still don't understand?

692
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,360
They blame you

693
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,080
for not letting them
join your jewelry business.

694
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,200
Yanqiu,

695
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
at least you should understand.

696
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,160
The jewelry business

697
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
doesn't only belong to me.

698
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,800
If Nan doesn't consent,

699
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,960
I can't let anybody join us.

700
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,920
Since we want to start a new company,
we must need manpower.

701
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,040
Why don't we let them all join us?

702
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,440
OK, I get it.

703
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,880
We need help anyway.

704
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
If they join us,

705
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,840
we'll be even stronger.

706
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,840
Alright, Tian,

707
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,120
just tell them they can join us

708
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,040
if they want to.

709
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,600
Alright then.

710
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,400
No problem.

711
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,740
(First Meeting of Agency Group)

712
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Now that everyone is here,

713
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
let's officially start our meeting.

714
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,320
First,

715
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
thanks to Xiaomei's proposal,

716
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,320
I decided to name the company Chunxiao.

717
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
It means to bring spring to the sick.

718
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,760
What do you think?

719
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,720
- Good!
- Great!

720
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,360
Nice.

721
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
OK, our second item.

722
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,680
After voting,

723
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
we have our slogan now.

724
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,880
It is
“quality first and benefit the people”.

725
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,280
- It is good.
- I like it.

726
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,320
Come on.

727
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
The slogan is meaningless.

728
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,800
Get to the point.

729
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,240
Enough of this formalism.

730
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,200
Ye Fang,

731
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,120
what's wrong?

732
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,520
You are billed by the minute now?

733
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,120
The reason why I announced the slogan

734
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
before the official meeting

735
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
was that I wanted everyone here

736
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,240
to remember our original intention.

737
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
Our new business

738
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,600
is not just about making money.

739
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,760
It's more about

740
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,800
finding the highest quality
medical devices

741
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,720
to benefit the people.

742
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,160
Only in this way

743
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,120
can each of us

744
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,760
be serious

745
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,880
about our cause,

746
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,800
and tighten up quality control
for our products.

747
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,480
- Well said.
- That's right.

748
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,440
OK.

749
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Everyone, listen to me.

750
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,440
The next

751
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,720
is the third item.

752
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,320
It is also an important topic
of our meeting.

753
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,520
That's how we should
divide the work in the future.

754
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,360
I think we should have three departments,

755
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,400
finance,

756
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,360
purchasing

757
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,320
and marketing.

758
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,520
Let's talk about finance first.

759
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
That is, investment.

760
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
Since everyone
is willing to work with me.

761
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,960
everyone here is

762
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
an original shareholder
of Chunxiao Health Care.

763
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,320
You all know that

764
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I made some money

765
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,560
doing jewelry business before.

766
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
So the company won't have

767
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
a big problem on the finance side.

768
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,000
But since you are
the original shareholders of the company,

769
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,120
I know very well that

770
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,400
you won't feel at ease

771
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,600
if I don't let you do anything.

772
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,680
How about this?

773
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,520
You can invest money or manpower.

774
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,680
Invest as much as you want

775
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,440
according to your actual conditions.

776
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
Tian and I own 51%

777
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
of the company's shares.

778
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
The rest

779
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,880
will be assigned to each of you.

780
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you have any comments?

781
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
No, no, no.

782
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,760
No problem.

783
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,120
- Good.
- This is good.

784
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,880
OK.

785
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,000
Yanqiu,

786
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
you will be in charge

787
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,880
of the company's expenses.

788
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,760
OK.

789
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,160
I'll be the head
of Logistics Support Department.

790
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,520
Yanqiu,

791
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,760
the economic lifeline

792
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,440
of all of us is in your own hands.

793
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,520
From now on, in addition to

794
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,440
prorate dividends,

795
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,800
each of you will get a monthly salary.

796
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,240
The salary

797
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,760
consists of basic salary and commission.

798
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,480
The more products you sell,

799
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,720
the more money you get.

800
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,880
What do you think?

801
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,280
- OK.
- OK. Good.

802
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
This is a good idea.

803
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I agree with it.

804
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,880
- OK.
- No problem.

805
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,360
OK, since you all agree,

806
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,240
let's continue.

807
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,120
The next is the market for our products.

808
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,680
Take Xiaomei's rehab center
as an example,

809
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,440
a classic rehab center

810
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,000
has thirty rehab equipment,

811
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,600
but more than a thousand patients

812
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,160
are waiting in line.

813
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Beijing Rehabilitation Center

814
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,920
is already the largest
rehab center in the country.

815
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,920
If even they are

816
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
so short of medical equipment,

817
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
the other cities can only be worse.

818
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,080
And this is just

819
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,480
the category of rehab equipment.

820
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,600
So everyone,

821
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
I can guarantee

822
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,360
that this is

823
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,840
a virgin land yet to be developed.

824
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,880
After our one-month market research,

825
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,640
and

826
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Ye Fang's help,

827
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,040
we finally decided to be

828
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,320
the agent
of Poole Willy's medical devices.

829
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,320
Pu'er?

830
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,040
I know Pu'er tea a lot

831
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,800
I didn't expect foreigners
to know Chinese tea.

832
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,960
You know nothing. Just listen.

833
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,120
Alright, listen to me.

834
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
Next,

835
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,040
Mr. Liu Chun of Poole Willy

836
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
will tell us more

837
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,920
about their products.

838
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,600
Mr. Liu.

839
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,360
Hello everyone, my name is Liu Chun.

840
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,520
Well,

841
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,560
I am the representative of Poole Willy.

842
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,800
Poole Willy has all kinds

843
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,800
of products.

844
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,160
The rehab equipment is part of them.

845
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,360
The products Chunsheng bought before

846
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,560
are also part of them.

847
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
Our product

848
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,720
are all of great quality.

849
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,960
They are all imported.

850
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,880
And we also have

851
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,280
professional equipment engineers,

852
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,400
responsible for after-sales maintenance.

853
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
But good products
also need good marketing.

854
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,080
We'll make our equipment better,

855
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,480
and I also hope that everyone

856
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,960
can do a good job at marketing.

857
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,480
Thank you. Thanks.

858
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,080
- Good.
- Well said.

859
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,560
Everyone, I believe you must be

860
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,600
more confident after listening

861
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,080
to Director Liu's introduction.

862
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,040
Next, I will announce

863
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,200
the specific job assignments.

864
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,200
Tian.

865
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
You are the most familiar with Beijing,

866
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
together with Cap and Cap-opener,

867
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,880
you'll find

868
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,080
a suitable place for us to work.

869
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,520
Alright. Consider it done.

870
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,640
All right then.

871
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
I'll be in charge of the sales channel.

872
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,360
Xiaomei, Fang.

873
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
You two are responsible

874
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,520
for the documents

875
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,440
we need to start the company,

876
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,480
such as business license.

877
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,680
There are too many

878
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,160
non-compliant agencies on the market.

879
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,880
Chunxiao can't join them.

880
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,040
OK.

881
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,960
No problem.

882
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,000
Everybody,

883
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,190
we will work together

884
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,230
in the future.

885
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,560
Come on!

886
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,710
One, two, three.

887
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,800
Chunxiao!

888
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,340
(Chunxiao Health Care)

889
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,040
Are you tired?

890
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,560
Not really.

891
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,670
I just feel a big pressure.

892
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,480
I thought you would
never be afraid of pressure.

893
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,560
They all invested their money

894
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
in Chunxiao.

895
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
I carry everyone's hopes

896
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,040
of getting rich.

897
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,840
Everyone is counting on me.

898
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,400
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stressed.

899
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,920
I'm very happy.

900
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
Comrade Tong Xiaomei,

901
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,360
I said I was stressed,

902
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,040
what are you happy about?

903
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,880
I'm happy because

904
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,160
you finally found what you want to do

905
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,880
and the way you want to take.

906
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm also happy
that you told me about your pressure.

907
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
All this time,

908
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,920
you have been bearing all pressure alone.

909
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,120
Now that you are willing
to tell me about it,

910
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,360
I am willing to share it with you.

911
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,680
I don't want you to share it.

912
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,880
I need someone to give me some strength.

913
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
How?

914
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Cut it out.

915
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,480
There are people around.

916
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,640
Actually, I am so happy

917
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
that I can work with so many people

918
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,720
towards a same goal.

919
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,960
I am happy when you are happy.

920
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm sorry,

921
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
we won't consider

922
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,680
your products for now.

923
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Our hospital
has long-term cooperative units.

924
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,240
Doctor,

925
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,920
please talk to the director again.

926
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,440
We really have equipment

927
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
that is very suitable for your hospital.

928
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,600
There are too many people
who want to cooperate with our hospital.

929
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,400
How about this?

930
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,120
Why don't you go to another hospital?

931
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,960
Doctor, I understand.

932
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,600
Well,

933
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,840
listen,

934
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I'll leave you some documents.

935
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,320
After the director comes back,

936
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
please show it to him.

937
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,200
The director might be interested in it.

938
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,360
OK.

939
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,520
All right, Doctor, goodbye.

940
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,080
Thank you for the documents.

941
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
How did it go, Chunsheng?

942
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,080
I went to five or six hospitals,

943
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,200
they didn't even let me in the door
of the procurement department.

944
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,320
I remember you got to know Director Qin

945
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,320
when you were
in the Anti-smuggling Squad.

946
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,000
Did you talk to him?

947
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,680
Director Qin?

948
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,800
I just met him once,

949
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,960
and never contacted him after that.

950
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Well, I'll try to ask him out tomorrow.

951
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,960
Listen, nowadays,

952
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,640
everybody you met

953
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,240
might help you out.

954
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,680
I think you should

955
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,720
try your luck.

956
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,080
OK.

957
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Director Qin,

958
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
I'll toast you.

959
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,800
I should leave now.

960
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,720
If I had known that

961
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
you had left the Anti-smuggling Squad,

962
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
I wouldn't have come.

963
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,960
I understand.

964
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,880
Thank you for coming, Director Qin.

965
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,200
I understand your request now.

966
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
Our department will consider

967
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,080
if your medical equipment

968
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,200
meets our requirements.

969
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
No problem, Director Qin.

970
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,960
Don't worry,

971
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,200
the quality of our products

972
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,320
can absolutely meet your requirements.

973
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,280
Product quality

974
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,960
is not our only assessment standard.

975
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,200
The price of your product is so high

976
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,080
that it's beyond our procurement budget.

977
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,280
I know that

978
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,720
some low-priced

979
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,920
medical equipment
has appeared on the market.

980
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
But Director Qin,

981
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,800
these medical devices

982
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
are either re-modified imported machine

983
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
or assembled products.

984
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,360
In fact, they're not up to standard at all.

985
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,600
Alright, enough.

986
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
We are looking
for cost-effective products.

987
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,760
Our products are all imported,

988
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,240
and we will take care of
the regular maintenance

989
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,680
and testing of our products.

990
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,200
I know

991
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
they are a bit expensive,

992
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
but you'll get what you pay for.

993
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
Besides, the devices you use

994
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,360
are a matter of life.

995
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,000
You should put product quality

996
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,400
in the first place.

997
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,280
Are you teaching me
how to purchase stuff?

998
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,880
Director Qin, I don't mean that.

999
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,880
Director Qin.

1000
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,200
You...

1001
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,200
Bye.

1002
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,080
Director Qin,

1003
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
please consider our medical equipment.

1004
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
It didn't go well again?

1005
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,480
Doctors are all very busy,

1006
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,000
and they have their own

1007
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
strict purchasing system.

1008
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,520
I knew they wouldn't trust you easily.

1009
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,640
I am just surprised.

1010
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,120
I thought a hospital would

1011
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,600
pay attention to quality and price

1012
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,120
when purchasing equipment.

1013
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
But I never thought...

1014
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,840
Be patient.

1015
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
It takes a new thing a period of time

1016
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,720
and a process from its emergence

1017
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,480
to being accepted.

1018
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,200
Since you want to be a pioneer,

1019
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,280
you should be mentally prepared for that.

1020
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,960
I am mentally prepared, I...

1021
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,800
I thought at least one out of ten hospitals

1022
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,680
would accept me.

1023
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
But it's zero.

1024
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Special times call for special measures.

1025
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,840
If there is really no way,

1026
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,840
a shortcut
is not necessarily a bad choice.

1027
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,920
What do you mean? You have an idea?

1028
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,920
I told my mother about your situation,

1029
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,160
and she wants to talk to you.

1030
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,600
Xiaomei,

1031
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,800
why did you tell your mother about it?

1032
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,000
She's my mom, I tell her everything.

1033
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,960
I don't want to bother her,

1034
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,840
and I don't want to take advantage of it.

1035
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,680
You are not taking advantage of it.

1036
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,640
It's actually a win-win situation.

1037
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,080
Her hospital is about to
purchase a new batch of equipment.

1038
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,280
You know how much they need equipment

1039
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,160
in the hospital.

1040
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,400
Moreover,

1041
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,560
my mother is notoriously strict.

1042
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,760
She's pretty hard to impress.

1043
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,440
If the quality of your products
is really not good,

1044
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,040
she will definitely
not recommend them to the hospital.

1045
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,680
OK. I'll try.

1046
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,160
Mom, you have heard the introduction.

1047
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,920
What do you think of their products?

1048
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
Mom, just tell him
if you are not satisfied with anything.

1049
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,960
Chunsheng will definitely correct it.

1050
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Mrs. Tong, how about this?

1051
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,240
We can send some equipment
to your hospital

1052
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,280
as samples.

1053
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,040
We are willing to accept a free trial

1054
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,240
to prove our value.

1055
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,520
You are open for a free trial?

1056
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,280
It seems you are very confident.

1057
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,640
Do you mean

1058
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,640
you are willing to help us, Mrs. Tong?

1059
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,080
No agency dares to

1060
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,440
accept a free trial in advance.

1061
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,160
Are you sure

1062
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,080
about this?

1063
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,440
Yes, I'm sure.

1064
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,200
And I have to do this.

1065
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,360
We are now in the early stages
of starting a business,

1066
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,640
we are willing to give up some interests

1067
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
for the opportunity
to be recognized by the market.

1068
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,480
All right then.

1069
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,080
Come to the hospital with me tomorrow.
