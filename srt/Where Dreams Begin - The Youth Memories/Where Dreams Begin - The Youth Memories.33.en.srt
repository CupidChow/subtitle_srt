=Episode 33=

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,800
But you will

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,240
break the market rules, right?

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
Have you made up your mind?

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes.

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,160
And I have to.

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,320
Now, we just started our business.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,600
We would rather make less money

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,360
as long as we can
be recognized by the market.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,440
Let's do this.

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Tomorrow, go to the hospital with me.

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,160
I'll take you to our purchasing director

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,240
and see if they just need

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,760
your products.

16
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
But just so you know,

17
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,630
I can only introduce you to him.

18
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,520
You have to take care of the rest.

19
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,920
Don't worry, Mrs. Tong.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,600
I won't let you down.

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,720
Thank you, Mom.

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
A girl usually defends her boyfriend.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
These days, Xiaomei nagged

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,720
and nearly deafened me.

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Mom.

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Now, I agreed to help you.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Then she'll no longer nag.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
Xiaomei, thank you.

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
Say "Thank you, Mom".

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Thank you...

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,680
Thank you, Mrs. Tong.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,640
Yanqiu, check this again.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,560
Three, two...

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,160
Meet the requirements of the bank.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
Chunsheng.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Oh, everyone's here.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
Let me tell you some good news.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,240
We've got Jingxi Hospital's order!

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,160
- Yeah!
- Great!

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,680
Congratulations!

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,600
And we're the main agent.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,320
Many departments of Jingxi Hospital

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,280
will adopt our instruments.

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,560
Wonderful!

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
Yanqiu, look. The contract.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
The deposit will be paid soon.

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
Most importantly,

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,640
I can pay out wages immediately!

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Yeah, wages!

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
It's the day we've been expecting.

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
Wages!

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, my treat.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,520
Let's go have dinner.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
Chunsheng, I'll tell you what.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,160
We'll order a lot of food this time.

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,320
Wait to spend all your money.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
- Go.
- Go.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,640
Qi Tian.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, Yanqiu.

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,920
What's wrong?

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,640
Send me to the hospital.

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,620
(Gynecology and Obstetrics
Operating Room)

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,960
Tian.

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
Congratulations. Your wife
gave birth to a daughter.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,440
Thank you, doctor.

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,680
Thank you.

67
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,950
Tian, congratulations!

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
I have a daughter?

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
I have a niece now.

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
I have a daughter.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I have a daughter.

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,120
Mr. Xiao.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Director Qin.

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Here we meet again.

75
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,080
Indeed.

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,760
Take your seat.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,640
Director Qin, thank you.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,880
Just call me Chunsheng.

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
What a rare opportunity!

80
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
At last,

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
we can talk in your office.

82
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Right.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
I'll call you Chunsheng.

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,200
It'll get us closer.

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,080
Chunsheng,

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,040
we tried

87
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,600
your instruments.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
They're indeed of good quality.

89
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,840
However,

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,400
is there possible

91
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,920
that we can get a better discount?

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Director Qin,

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
let me tell you the truth.

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
We're already earning

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
the lowest profit.

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Our goal for the early phase

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,320
isn't to make money,

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
but to build a marketplace.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
So, it is

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
the best price we can give.

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,920
We don't have too much money.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,320
It's hard for us, too.

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,160
Right, I get it, Director Qin.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,640
Actually, I came to you

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,040
for a discussion about something else.

106
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,200
OK.

107
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Please check this.

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,520
I know your hospital director

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,160
has been applying
for the National Heart Research Base.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,940
(Document Envelop)

111
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I asked

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,760
our foreign suppliers

113
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
to bring back the documents.

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,160
They keep making contact

115
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,440
with many research institutions
and college labs.

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,400
These must be the latest documents.

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,960
I believe your director

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
needs them urgently.

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,760
And of course,

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,240
Director Qin,

121
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
you asked me

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
to bring back these documents.

123
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,200
You're even considering it for me.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,640
This is exactly what our director needs.

125
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Chunsheng,

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,120
you're so clever

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,600
that you'll be a very good businessman.

128
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
Thank you, on behalf of our director.

129
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
My pleasure.

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,320
From now on,

131
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,920
you'll have the purchase order

132
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,000
for our instruments.

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
Thank you, Director Qin.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,360
And of course,

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
it's not because of the documents.

136
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
We tried

137
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
your instruments

138
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
and they worked very well.

139
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,520
We must spend money very wisely.

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,840
Good instruments are worth the money.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,480
Right.

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,000
You're right, Director Qin.

143
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,960
By the way,

144
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
we plan to purchase

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,600
five far-infrared
therapeutic apparatuses.

146
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Urgent need. In a day or two.

147
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,480
Can you handle that?

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,800
No problem.

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Count on me.

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,640
Don't worry.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Great.

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm back.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,560
So thirsty.

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,080
Why are you so drunk again?

155
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Mom asked me what took you so long

156
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,840
and I didn't know how to reply.

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,840
People say "run for business".

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,440
I have to run, OK?

159
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,920
But you got nothing in the end.

160
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,480
Didn't you?

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
You seem to be in a good mood.

162
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Got anything?

163
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,760
No, nothing.

164
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,680
I just haven't met my friends for days.

165
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
We drank and enjoyed ourselves.

166
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,040
That's it.

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,480
Is everyone doing all right?

168
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,040
Yes.

169
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,640
Very good.

170
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Some made money

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
and some were promoted.

172
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Who do you want to know about?

173
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,550
No one.

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,670
Xiao Chunsheng,

175
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,360
right?

176
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
No.

He's in sweet love with Tong Xiaomei.

179
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
Satisfied, huh?

180
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll go make some porridge.

Would you like some?

However great business
Xiao Chunsheng does

183

or however much money he earns,

184
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,200
I won't make you regret marrying me.

185
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
I haven't seen him since I was back,

186
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,880
just because I'm trying hard
to outrun him.

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
I'll make you realize

188
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
that being my wife is the right choice.

if you trust me,

cooperate with me.

Think about it.

I'm now a leader.

can we do this business?

Can we?

204
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,720
Of course, we can.

205
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
And we'll make big money.

206
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
What? You don't trust me?

you're my brother-in-law.

Cheers.

211
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
Have you contacted Chunsheng?

212
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Actually in my heart,

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,880
you're never inferior to you-know-who.

From this day on,

224
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,240
we'll make money together
and share the problem.

(Kangle Medical Equipment Company)
Xiao, a new order?

228
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,920
What?

229
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
Making more money upsets you?

230
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,480
No way. The more, the better.

231
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Liu, let me tell you something.

232
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,240
You should tell your company

233
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,760
that medical instruments
for the Chinese market

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,640
must be of better quality.

235
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Xiaomei and I

236
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,320
talked with the doctors

237
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
of the hospital.

238
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,680
I realized that they actually know

239
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
about the latest and most advanced

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
medical instruments in the world.

241
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
And the hospital has

242
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
higher demands than we imagined.

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,760
So, we can't fool

244
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
Chinese hospitals

245
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,680
with something that is about
to be phased out.

246
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,400
OK, OK.

247
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,000
Another thing.

248
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,640
When we sell

249
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,200
high-end medical instruments,

250
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,760
the quantity may be low,

251
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,480
but the unit price is high.

252
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,240
So, we don't make less money.

253
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,720
Also, the earlier we sell

254
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
high-end medical instruments,

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
the earlier we can occupy the market.

256
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,480
We can't let other medical instruments
of the same sort

257
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
get a quicker start.

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760
Check the order.

259
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,880
Today, Xiaomei and I

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
got an urgent purchase.

261
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,760
Check it.

262
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
Who's Xiao Chunsheng?

263
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Come on.

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,680
I am. And who are you?

265
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,320
Here's the thing. Listen.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,520
You offer the hospital a free trial

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,640
of your medical instruments.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And this is breaking the rule, you know?

269
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,680
Let me reason you out.

270
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
When you offer a free trial,

271
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,480
your instruments will
certainly be chosen.

272
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,920
And when you do this,

273
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,640
other companies will follow.

274
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,600
What about the instruments
that are tried but not chosen?

275
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,120
All right.

276
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,440
You want to reason me out, huh?

277
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,640
Let me tell you something, too.

278
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
How about you think

279
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,200
about why the hospital chose my products

280
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
instead of yours?

281
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,480
Quality is the sole criterion.

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,240
If we offered

283
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,400
poor instruments,

284
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,480
not to mention a free trial,

285
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
even if they were free of charge,

286
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,000
the hospital wouldn't want them!

287
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
Don't talk nonsense!

288
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,240
What are you doing?

289
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
Go away!

290
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,800
Let's try to get along.

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,520
- Talk politely.
- None of your business!

292
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,240
Go away!

293
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,800
Stay out of this.

294
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,240
But Chunsheng...

295
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
Stay out!

296
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,360
What do you want?

297
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
What do you think?

298
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
What are you doing here?

299
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,960
Step aside!

300
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,760
Why is it you again?

301
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,360
Are you OK?

302
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,640
Yes, Director Ma.

303
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,840
I warn you. The police are coming.

304
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,440
If you want no trouble,
leave immediately.

305
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,640
Fine, Director Ma.

306
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,240
Since you're here, I'll show respect to you.

307
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,760
No problem. I'll leave right away.

308
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,520
But young man, listen.

309
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,520
Don't push it in case it gets back.

310
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,000
- You know this, huh?
- Come on, say no more.

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
Go, go.

312
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,320
- Come on!
- Let's go.

313
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
Out you go.

314
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,360
Go!

315
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,400
Sorry. Go!

316
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,720
Thank you, Director Ma.

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
Out you go.

318
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
Chunsheng, what's wrong?

319
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
Nothing. I'm OK, Xiaomei.

320
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,200
Don't worry.

321
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
I just haven't exercised for long.

322
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,760
When he pushed me, I got a sprain.

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
It's OK. Don't worry.

324
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
How could it be OK?

325
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,400
What if your old injury flared up?

326
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm really all right, Xiaomei.

327
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,600
Let's go to the hospital

328
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,880
for a checkup.

329
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Before I'm sure you're OK,
I won't stop worrying.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,920
Fine, fine.

331
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,000
If you can't stop worrying,

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
let's go to the hospital.

333
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,720
OK?

334
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
Come on, go.

335
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,560
Liu, we should go.

336
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
OK. Be careful.

337
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,240
By the way,

338
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
remember what I just told you.

339
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,960
I will.

340
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Bye.

341
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,360
Go.

342
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,160
Not a big problem, Xiaomei.

343
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,960
Judging from the CT,

344
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
nothing has gone wrong.

345
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,120
Puffy legs

346
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,520
are possibly caused by recent exhaustion.

347
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
After all, you were badly wounded.

348
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,640
You should be more cautious.

349
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,280
Take better rest lately.

350
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,800
Thank you, doctor.

351
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Thank you.

352
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,060
(Reception)

353
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,360
See? I told you I was OK.

354
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,920
You were just too nervous.

355
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
Shuan, I have something to do.

356
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,600
Sit here for a while.

357
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,440
I'll talk to you later.

358
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,520
OK, Liu.

359
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,640
Tian, what brings you here?

360
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
We just got an order

361
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
for far-infrared therapeutic apparatuses.

362
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,320
I came to check if we had enough.

363
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,520
They're in short supply now.

364
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
No replenishment recently, I'm afraid.

365
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,280
How about this?

366
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,720
I'm going out for an emergency.

367
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,360
You sit here for a while.

368
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
When I'm back, I'll think of a way.

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
OK. Focus on your business.

370
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,840
All right.

371
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,480
I'll be waiting.

372
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,960
OK.

373
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,320
Tian? Can't you recognize me?

374
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm Shuan, who lived next door.

375
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
Sh... Shuan?

376
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,240
But you went to Shandong
with your parents, didn't you?

377
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
That year,

378
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,360
my parents went there for business.

379
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
I didn't want to go.

380
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,560
But I had to.

381
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,800
Over the past years, I've been
thinking of coming back to Beijing

382
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,360
and I've missed my friends
in the neighborhood.

383
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,680
A few years ago,
my mother was badly sick.

384
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,880
She couldn't be cured in Shandong,

385
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
and we had to return.

386
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
When taking care of her,

387
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,760
I engaged with medical instruments.

388
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,200
Then, I got a relevant job.

389
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,840
I've been doing this
for over two years, Tian.

390
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
So, you're a senior.

391
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,560
Don't tease me.

392
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
Everyone in this market

393
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,280
has heard about you and Chunsheng.

394
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
Then why didn't you come to me?

395
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,720
I know you and Chunsheng

396
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,000
do great business.

397
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
If I went to you,

398
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,720
you might think I was flattering you.

399
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,200
Don't overthink.

400
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,960
As long as you offer quality instruments,

401
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
we're OK to buy some from you.

402
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Friends come first, right?

403
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,520
Tian, I've been doing this
for a few years.

404
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,320
We import

405
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,920
complete instruments

406
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,320
and the quality is very good.

407
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,400
What products do you have?

408
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,080
A lot of kinds.

409
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,320
Electromagnetic instruments,
far-infrared therapeutic apparatuses...

410
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,920
Wait.

411
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
You have far-infrared
therapeutic apparatuses?

412
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,520
Yes.

413
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
Oh, you want some?

414
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Do you have total certificates?

415
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,070
We do, Tian.

416
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,200
We just got an order for five sets.

417
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,350
How many do you have?

418
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,440
Five?

419
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
I only have three.

420
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,070
I'll get two more for you.

421
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,560
Say no more and take me there. Go.

422
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,160
Go, Tian.

423
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,920
- Go.
- OK.

424
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,640
Waiter.

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,560
The bill, please.

426
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
Hello, sir. Miss Gu paid the bill.

427
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,680
Our company is the agent of the wine.

428
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,440
The bill is on me.

429
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
As a wine promotion.

430
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
I can claim the bill, anyway.

431
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,840
You know me?

432
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
I work for Mr. Li.

433
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,080
When you met him,

434
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,360
I was standing behind.

435
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,400
Sorry. I was too busy last time

436
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
to notice you.

437
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,680
That's understandable.

438
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
You were up there

439
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,760
while I had to look up from the corner.

440
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
You couldn't notice me, with no doubt.

441
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
My apologies.

442
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,680
But I had a deep impression of you.

443
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,480
You did?

444
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,040
Leaving?

445
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,800
I should go home.

446
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,320
But it's still early.

447
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,520
We're also the agent
of some famous foreign brands.

448
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Taste some.

449
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,520
Honey,

450
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,920
still awake?

451
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Clients invited me to dinner
and I drank too much.

452
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,520
I could have drunk only a little.

453
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,880
But they were way too hospitable.

454
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
I had to drink more.

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,760
A female client?

456
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
There are female clients.

457
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,440
A lot of them, male and female.

458
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
Take some early rest. I'm going to bed.

459
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,080
Ye Fang,

460
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,120
still blaming me for Chunsheng?

461
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,840
You know what?

462
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,560
Chunsheng no longer blames me.

463
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,840
When he bought
the rehabilitation instruments,

464
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,440
I introduced the supplier.

465
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I also helped

466
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
with the direction of his new career.

467
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,560
This is what makes you shameless.

468
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,640
When you hurt someone,

469
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,200
you never keep it in mind.

470
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,240
But when you do a little favor,

471
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,840
you take all the credit.

472
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,760
Ye Fang, whatever I do,

473
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,640
you think I'm wrong,

474
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,840
right?

475
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,200
Fine.

476
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,400
I'll no longer interfere
with Xiao Chunsheng.

477
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,520
Whether he succeeds or fails

478
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,800
will be out of my concern.

479
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,420
(Unit One)

480
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
The last day.

481
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
Rest for the last day

482
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,920
and I'll let you out.

483
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,840
OK.

484
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,760
Dr. Tong, you call the shots.

485
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,120
Chunsheng.

486
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,240
Tian?

487
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
What's wrong, Tian?

488
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Tell me about it. What happened?

489
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,000
Chunsheng,

490
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,720
I made some trouble.

491
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,080
What trouble?

492
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
We had an order

493
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,120
for five far-infrared
therapeutic apparatuses.

494
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Liu Chun didn't have enough.

495
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,800
I met Shuan there.

496
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,240
He said he had some

497
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,320
and the certificates were available.

498
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,320
The price wasn't low, either.

499
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,720
I watched this guy grow up

500
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
- and I didn't think he would lie...
- Tian,

501
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
just get to the point. What happened?

502
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,040
The point is the apparatuses
were sold to the hospital.

503
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,840
I gave the money to Shuan.

504
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
But during the operation,
three patients were hurt.

505
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,080
Their legs were burnt

506
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,680
with varying degrees.

507
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
What? Patients were burnt?

508
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,440
Come on, Qi Tian, what have you done?

509
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,760
Chunsheng, calm down.

510
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,600
Let him finish.

511
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,800
The hospital asked
for compensation and refunds.

512
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,560
What's worse, they called the police.

513
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,600
The police sealed our warehouse.

514
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,360
I got the money
but couldn't deliver the instruments.

515
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,480
How can I pay for breach of contract?

516
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,440
Tian,

517
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,400
Shuan's apparatuses must be unqualified.

518
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,240
Yes. According to the State Administration
for Industry and Commerce,

519
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,000
his apparatuses are unqualified.

520
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
They're actually reassembled.

521
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,800
Only some imported opponents are used.

522
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,680
- But...
- Say no more.

523
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Where's Shuan?

524
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,000
I can't find him.

525
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,480
I looked for him,
but his neighbors said he wasn't in

526
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
and his parents didn't come back.

527
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,440
He even swore to me...

528
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,160
It's no use saying this, Tian!

529
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,240
But...

530
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,560
We have to be responsible for this case.

531
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
We sold unqualified instruments

532
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,600
and we have to take care of it.

533
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,880
Not we, but I... I sold them!

534
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
It's no use arguing, Tian!

535
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,240
Well,

536
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,600
we must give a solution
to the hospital and the patients.

537
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,600
We can't let this case

538
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,800
ruin the reputation
of Chunxiao Health Care.

539
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Chunsheng is right.

540
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Chunsheng, Xiaomei, listen.

541
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,640
The hospital didn't ask
for only a little money.

542
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
It can be astronomical to us.

543
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,160
Tian, we have to compensate,
however much it is.

544
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,960
This isn't a small case.

545
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,640
We must show the hospital

546
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
that we're a responsible company.

547
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,320
Otherwise...

548
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,880
Otherwise, Chunxiao Health Care

549
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,200
would be totally gone.

550
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,960
We spent a large amount of money
on the products for BACC,

551
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,760
and another large amount
on medical instruments.

552
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,240
Now, how could we have

553
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
some more cash?

554
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,280
Well, tell the hospital

555
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,040
that we won't be a deadbeat.

556
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,960
Five days. Give me five days.

557
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,200
I promise I'll get the money.

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Come on, just go.

559
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,680
OK.

560
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,320
Wait, Tian. Your bag.

561
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,360
Go.

562
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
Xiaomei, it's OK.

563
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,280
I can take care of it.

564
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,600
I can.

565
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,480
Everything will be all right.

566
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,320
How about I go to Xiang Nan

567
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,200
and ask him to give us

568
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,280
the year-end dividends in advance?

569
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,720
No, you can't.

570
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,880
Tian,

571
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
rules are very important in business.

572
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,160
For our jade business,

573
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,560
the dividends are
always given punctually.

574
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,440
Now, we offer more products

575
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
and more money is needed.

576
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,680
If you ask him
for dividends at this moment,

577
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,880
you'll give him a hard time.

578
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,520
What else can we do, then?

579
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,400
Calm down.

580
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
We still have two days, right?

581
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
Let's think of a way.

582
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,000
Come in.

583
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,560
Xiaomei?

584
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
What brings you here now?

585
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,520
I came to check on you.

586
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,000
Duan Lei's letter was sent to your flat.

587
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,560
In case it's about something urgent,
I brought it to you.

588
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
It's OK. We'll think of a way.

589
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,860
(Chunxiao Health Care)

590
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,160
What?

591
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Duan Lei

592
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,240
passed away.

593
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,520
Well done, man.

594
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,360
I'm Xiao Chunsheng. And you?

595
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
Quite arrogant.

596
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,120
- Fight!
- Fight!

597
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,000
Come on!

598
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,360
It doesn't count!

599
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,040
Duan Lei, compete with me in pull-ups.

600
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
Bring it on.

601
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,080
Since little, I've been practicing this

602
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,800
with those military guards.

603
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Pull-ups are what I'm best at.

604
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,160
105.

605
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,280
106.

606
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,720
What, Xiao Chunsheng?

607
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
Convinced or not?

608
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,080
Lei,

609
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,240
we're still good buddies, though.

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,640
Got it.

611
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,360
I still won.

612
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,960
Competing with you one more time,

613
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,280
I felt great.

614
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,040
Having a rival like you,

615
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,640
I feel great, too.

616
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,320
From this day on,

617
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,040
we are

618
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,600
the best buddies.

619
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,680
Comrades-in-arms of a lifetime.

620
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,760
Best buddies of a lifetime.

621
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,600
I brought you breakfast.

622
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,240
Have something to eat.

623
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,040
Xiaomei, don't worry about me.

624
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,040
It's just that Lei died so unexpectedly

625
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
and I couldn't accept it for now.

626
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,440
I know.

627
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,120
You're very close to him

628
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,040
and you need some time.

629
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
Just because we're close,

630
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,680
I don't want him to see

631
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,080
how sad I am now.

632
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,520
You know what? According to the letter,

633
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,720
that unpleasant steel nail in his body

634
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,040
got him killed in his mission.

635
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,320
I can't be defeated.

636
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,360
I must realize the updating

637
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
of medical instruments as soon as I can.

638
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,400
I have to persist.

639
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
You're indeed positive,
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng.

640
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,600
Glad to see you think like this.

641
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,880
Don't worry about the compensation.

642
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,000
I've borrowed money from my parents.

643
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,160
No way.

644
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,040
I can't trouble you anymore.

645
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
Every time I'm in trouble, you help.

646
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,760
What a useless man I would be!

647
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,640
Xiaomei, don't worry.

648
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
My sister and I have agreed.

649
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,360
We'll spend all our savings
on the compensation.

650
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,280
Xiang Nan's dividends
will be transferred soon.

651
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,120
That's great.

652
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,280
With the dividends,

653
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
we can solve the problem.

654
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,920
I'll keep you company.

655
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,360
I thought after this case,

656
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,640
Chunxiao Health Care would collapse.

657
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
Unexpectedly, we survived.

658
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,560
Come on.

659
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,760
Thank you, guys, for not leaving me.

660
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,440
Thank you. I'll drink it up.

661
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,360
Next,

662
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,720
I have an announcement to make.

663
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,760
This case greatly inspired me.

664
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,280
We will make
our own medical instruments.

665
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,840
We can't only rely on imported ones.

666
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,080
Can... Can we do that?

667
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,360
Tian, trust me.

668
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,080
It's the goal of our transition.

669
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
Within five or even ten years,

670
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
we will achieve it.

671
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,480
If...

672
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,360
I mean if.

673
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,400
If we transform
from trading to producing,

674
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,080
we can't do that alone.

675
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,800
We grew up without too much knowledge.

676
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,600
However hard we try,

677
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,440
this is already the best we can do.

678
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,880
When we want further development,

679
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,000
we have to recruit some talents.

680
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,480
But we're a small company.

681
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
How can we recruit any talents?

682
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,320
Chunsheng,

683
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
the government encourages
private enterprises.

684
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,710
But most people only want
permanent jobs.

685
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,360
We can't compete with big companies.

686
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,520
Then why would knowledgeable guys

687
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,920
work for us?

688
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,080
I have an idea.

689
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Listen.

690
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,480
Considering we can't

691
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,320
offer some cash now,

692
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,440
what can we do?

693
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,920
Offer them some money in the future.

694
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,920
Leave this to me.

695
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll ask our talent center
for recommendation.

696
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
It would be more reliable.

697
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,880
If our recruited talents

698
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,760
help us invent new products,

699
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,190
we'll promise them

700
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,230
5% of the subsequent profit.

701
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,320
To attract them.

702
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,190
I get it.

703
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,150
You mean profit promise.

704
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,080
Yes. Think about it.

705
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,720
Generous rewards rouse one to heroism.

706
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,200
And our medical projects

707
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,680
are very promising on the market.

708
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,800
Why don't we just be bolder?

709
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
According to Xiaomei,

710
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,040
some professors and head physicians

711
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
have nothing to do

712
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,400
after they retire.

713
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,640
If we can recruit them,

714
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,000
they'll be excellent talents.

715
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Be careful.

716
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm OK, Xiaomei.

717
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:24,760
Sit down.

718
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,160
We got an order again.

719
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Be careful.

720
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm really OK.

721
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,200
I'm fine, Xiaomei.

722
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,840
Don't worry about me.

723
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,400
I know you're delighted.

724
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,560
But you needn't have drunk that much.

725
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Here.

726
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,720
Have some tea.

727
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,520
Xiaomei,

728
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,640
if only Duan Lei was still alive!

729
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,920
If only he was still alive!

730
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,560
He promised me.

731
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
He said when we got married,

732
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,920
he would come to Beijing.

733
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,000
He promised me.

734
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,240
He said when we got married,

735
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,000
he would come to Beijing.

736
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,120
We even went through the gunfire.

737
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,360
Why did he die?

738
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,680
Chunsheng, let's get married.

739
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,460
(Congratulations on the opening ceremony
of Beijing Huasheng Trade Company)

740
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,140
(By Li Shangyou, By Chen Hongjun)

741
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,360
From this day on,
hope we'll stick together,

742
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,360
struggle and make contributions

743
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,960
for Huasheng's future.

744
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,480
- Nice!
- Right!

745
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,480
- (When Xiao Chunsheng made a fresh start,)
- OK. Bye.

746
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
(Ye Guohua was doing
better business, too.)

747
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Hope we'll help each other.

748
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Thank you. Thank you.

749
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,840
Wish us good cooperation!

750
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,120
What?

751
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,000
With this order,

752
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Huasheng will be
the flagship of this industry.

753
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
Your effort wasn't wasted, huh?

754
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,720
Hongjun,

755
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,240
it's not that hard to do business.

756
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,920
It's not.

757
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,040
But it depends on your partner.

758
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
What, Mr. Ye?

759
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,320
When will you buy a house?

760
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,160
A house?

761
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,400
Next month.

762
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,720
It's so late. Why are you still up?

763
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,360
Waiting for you.

764
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,240
I have something to ask you.

765
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,240
For me? Tell me.

766
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,720
What do you want?

767
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,480
You were out there with my brother?

768
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
You've been very close lately.

769
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,440
What a ridiculous question!

770
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,440
Guohua and I have been best buddies.

771
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,560
And now, he's my brother-in-law.

772
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,640
When I have resources and abilities,

773
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,320
I should help him.

774
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,160
That's for sure.

775
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,480
Don't set my brother up.

776
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,960
What are you talking about?

777
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,680
Why would I set him up?

778
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,320
Don't you know our relationship?

779
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
We're friends and relatives.

780
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,120
In my heart,

781
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,280
he's like my real brother.

782
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,440
How could I set him up?

783
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,880
Real brother?

784
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,600
You used to say
Xiao Chunsheng was your real brother.

785
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,680
You keep talking about Xiao Chunsheng.

786
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,760
Will you cut it out?

787
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
You just can't get it over, huh?

788
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,960
Fine.

789
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,360
I indeed did something wrong,

790
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,880
OK?

791
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,160
But this is a different case.

792
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,840
Guohua isn't Xiao Chunsheng.

793
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,680
You...

794
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,040
What do you exactly think of me?

795
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,800
Why do you think I would set Guohua up?

796
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,040
How absurd!

797
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,360
What do I think of you?

798
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,760
I know exactly what you think.

799
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,080
Fine. Tell me about it.

800
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm all ears.

801
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
What do I think?

802
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,120
Make it very clear now.

803
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,480
Come on.

804
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,840
Now, my brother relies
on you in business.

805
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,520
You're certainly delighted,

806
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,480
thinking it's a chance

807
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,800
where you can show off

808
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
in front of my family and me.

809
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,040
But if one day,

810
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,440
my brother does bigger business

811
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,480
and no longer needs your help,

812
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,640
can a narrow-minded man like you

813
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,000
still bear him?

814
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,600
Will you not play dirty tricks?

815
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,960
Narrow-minded?

816
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,200
Is this what you think of me?

817
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes.

818
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,200
Fine.

819
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,120
You win.

820
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,240
You totally win, Ye Fang.

821
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,520
We've been married for so many years.

822
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
But you think I'm narrow-minded, huh?

823
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Sometimes, I wondered

824
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,080
when it started.

825
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
I thought about it for a long time

826
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,840
and I finally figured it out.

827
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,320
From the very beginning,
you despised me,

828
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,920
right?

829
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,040
Among all of us, you think

830
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,840
I'm the worst one.

831
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,240
I'm not as faithful as Xiao Chunsheng,

832
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,960
not as powerful as Ye Guohua,

833
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,520
not as sophisticated as Xiaoliu,

834
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,560
and not as humorous as Xiang Dong.

835
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,360
Right?

836
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,800
I've never despised you.

837
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,600
Never?

838
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,120
If you hadn't despised me,

839
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,400
you wouldn't have given me
the bad name of raping

840
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,080
just to run away from the wedding.

841
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,840
If your brother hadn't despised me,

842
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
he wouldn't have punched me
irresponsibly.

843
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,840
And your parents.

844
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
They wouldn't have given me
a hard time just for trifles.

845
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,120
Even Xiao Chunsheng,

846
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
if he hadn't despised me,

847
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,280
he wouldn't have embarrassed me
in front of our leaders

848
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
and put me on the spot.

849
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,880
I'd like to ask you, Ye Fang.

850
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,800
Are you guys just selfish

851
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,600
or do you just not care about me?

852
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,760
Chen Hongjun,

853
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,040
ask yourself.

854
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,160
Who's the selfish guy?

855
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,280
You're the most selfish guy, actually.

856
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,160
I'm selfish?

857
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,520
Fine.

858
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,760
I am.

859
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,560
I'm the most selfish!

860
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,280
Satisfied?

861
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,120
But who am I being selfish for?

862
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,360
For you,

863
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,520
and our family!
