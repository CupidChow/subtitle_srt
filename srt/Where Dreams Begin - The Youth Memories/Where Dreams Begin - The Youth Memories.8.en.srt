3
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
Today is your engagement.

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,800
Why do I feel that you are not happy?

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,520
Hongjun, we are best friends.

6
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
If you don't wanna do it,

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
you can call it off now.

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,080
Chunsheng,

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,440
I like Ye Fang,

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm just not sure if she likes me or not.

11
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
You silly boy.

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,960
If she doesn't like you,

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,360
why is she engaged to you?

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
Since you said so,

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,520
I believe you.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,600
OK. Let's get back in.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Everyone is waiting for us.

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Come on.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,520
(Many years later,)

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,440
(Chen Hongjun often thought of
Xiao Chunsheng's words.)

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,760
(He wondered if Xiao Chunsheng
hadn't said this at the time,)

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,200
(if his life could be different.)

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
This is wonderful.

24
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Are we gonna eat one of these fish?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,760
Mrs. Chen,

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
I really want to cook one for you,

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm just afraid that my mom will kill me.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
In her eyes,

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
these fish are more precious than me.

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
These are ornamental fish?

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,160
Yes.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,440
Look at me.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,640
I made a fool of myself.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,520
It's OK.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
I'll shut up.

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,680
Wow.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,360
What a great feast.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,880
Come on,

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
let's drink a toast to Mrs. Chen.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Come on.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
A toast to you.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh, no, no, no.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,880
Listen, I just want to say that

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,600
today, the two kids
are officially engaged.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Starting today,

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Hongjun is our son.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,120
Of course,

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
Ye Fang is also your daughter.

49
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Mrs. Chen, I am not
robbing you of your son.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,040
I just want to tell you that

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,320
I will treat Hongjun

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
the same way I treat Guohua.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
And from now on,

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
you don't have to worry
about Hongjun anymore.

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
You can enjoy your life now.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,360
You are talking too much.

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Let Mrs. Chen talk.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Oh, that's right.

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
What's your opinion, Mrs. Chen?

60
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,240
What can I say?

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,560
You are a commander,

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,640
you call the shot.

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
Don't call me that.

64
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,560
We are family now.

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Come on.

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Raise your glasses.

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,320
Let's celebrate the engagement
of Hongjun and Ye Fang.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
- Come on, Mrs. Chen.
- Come on.

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,480
- Cheers.
- Dad.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,800
I have something to say.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
All right. Go on.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,200
I don't care what outsiders think or say,

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,120
but everyone here is my family.

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
I want to make it clear

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
before we get engaged.

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Hongjun

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,800
didn't rape me at all.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,800
He has always respected me.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
I don't like Chen Tao.

81
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,240
I tried to accept him,

82
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
but I failed.

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
His family forced me to marry him,

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
but I didn't want to.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
I didn't know what to do

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
and I didn't want
to give you a hard time,

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
that's why I did that.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
This whole thing,

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,240
it's all my idea.

90
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,840
Hongjun just helped me.

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
I owe you.

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,520
I'm done.

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Cheers.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
Let's wish Ye Fang and Hongjun happiness.

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,240
Come on.

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
Hongjun, I'm sorry

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
for what I did.

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's get hammered today.

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Guohua,

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
I have to tell you something.

102
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,200
The superior made the decision.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,280
Your Uncle Xiao's matter
still needs some time.

104
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,600
So this time,

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Xiao Chunsheng

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,480
can't go join the military with you.

107
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,040
Does Chunsheng know about this?

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
I haven't told him yet.

109
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Don't you often see him?

110
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Well,

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,560
you tell him.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Mr. Niu,

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
did anyone call me?

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,200
Chunsheng.

115
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
No.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,400
Chunsheng,

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,600
I will let you know
if there's a call for you.

118
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,160
OK.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you, Mr. Niu.

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll let you know.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
OK. Thank you.

122
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,340
(Fancy Wooden Violin Case  Price: 15.6 yuan)

123
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,420
(Quiet  Ward Area)

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,000
Xiaomei.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
You're back.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,400
I heard Chunsheng say

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,360
you went to Beidaihe for training.

128
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
How did it go?

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,560
Did it go well?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, I think so.

131
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
And I heard

132
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
you have been close
to Chunsheng recently.

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Mr. Xiao needs to measure
his blood pressure once a week,

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
so I go there every week.

135
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,480
Every week, huh?

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,280
What's the matter?

137
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,000
I remember

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,440
you've always wanted to be a doctor.

139
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Why don't you stay?

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
Just say what you have to say,

141
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
stop beating around the bush.

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
I want Hongling to join the art troupe.

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
But now all places are occupied.

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
I heard that you've got a place.

145
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
So I was thinking,
since you don't want to go,

146
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
why don't you...

147
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,400
You want me to give it to her?

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,280
And you want to be together with her?

149
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Yes.

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
You know she doesn't like you,

151
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,680
so you shouldn't...

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
Xiaomei,

153
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,950
I didn't come to listen to your lecture.

154
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Just tell me,

155
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
yes or no.

156
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,070
I can give her the chance,

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,520
but it's for Chunsheng and Hongling,

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
not for you.

159
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
Do you understand?

160
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,160
Mrs. He,

161
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,520
I'm here to talk to Hongling
about something.

162
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
Hongling, come on.

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,400
What's the matter?

164
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
Xiaomei told me that

165
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,800
she's gonna let you
take her place in the art troupe.

166
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,120
What?

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
But I heard that

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
the art troupe will still
conduct an assessment on you.

169
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,720
You must practice well.

170
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,720
Really?

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
That means we can join the army together!

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,680
But there's an assessment.

173
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,520
Which piece should I play?

174
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
Chunsheng, I'm so nervous.

175
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,560
What's going on?

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
The He Hongling I know is never nervous.

177
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
How can I not be?

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,440
This might be the only chance in my life.

179
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Besides,

180
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
I've never performed on a formal stage.

181
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
What if I screw it up?

182
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
Just practice well,

183
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,600
and leave the rest to me.

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,720
Don't be distracted. Focus.

185
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
How many years
have you played the violin?

186
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Eleven.

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
I shouldn't have come.

188
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
It's not fair to the others

189
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
for me to watch your show in private.

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,480
But this girl came to my door

191
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
early in the morning,

192
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,640
saying that if I didn't come today,

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,560
I would miss the best
violin player in Beijing.

194
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,080
"Under the Silver Moonlight".

195
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,920
This is a hard piece.

196
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,960
And you've played the best version
I've ever heard.

197
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
For the interview
on the 1st of next month,

198
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
I'll save a spot for you.

199
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
Thank you, sir.

200
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,480
Hongling,

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
you played really well just now.

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,560
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

203
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I was not even ready.

204
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,800
You are the best

205
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,520
even if you don't prepare at all.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
Chunsheng,
we can go to the army together!

207
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,480
Hongling.

208
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
You played the violin
really well just now.

209
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,000
Thanks.

210
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Actually,

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,440
I asked Xiaomei to bring her father here.

212
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,520
Guohua,

213
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,960
maybe something I did the other day

214
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,800
misled you.

215
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,320
But I have figured it out now.

216
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,720
I want to be with Chunsheng.

217
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,480
And we're going to serve
in the military together.

218
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,720
Hongling,
Chunsheng can't join the army with you.

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,640
He failed the political appraisal.

220
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,240
Xiaomei, thank you so much.

221
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
Hongling, come here.

222
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,960
I just promised Xiaomei that

223
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,680
I'd treat her to dinner to thank her

224
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
at Moscow Restaurant.

225
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,840
Of course.

226
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,640
(Xiao Chunsheng found out that)

227
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,240
(He Hongling was not
as happy as he expected.)

228
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,320
(Tong Xiaomei and Ye Guohua
were also worried about something.)

229
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
(He didn't realize that
the enlistment matter)

230
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,680
(had set off)

231
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,000
(Be vigilant to defend our country)
(a huge emotional wave among them.)

232
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
Yanqiu, you are back
from your business trip.

233
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
This business trip was a long one.

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
I came back as soon as I was done.

235
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
I forgot to introduce you.

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
This is He Hongling.

237
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,840
Yanqiu.

238
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,720
Hello.

239
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
I heard my dad say that

240
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
during my absence,

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,040
it's you who took care of him.

242
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
Thank you.

243
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
You are welcome.

244
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,480
I've been staying in your room
all this time.

245
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,400
I should thank you.

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,680
Not at all.

247
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,760
I was not here anyway.

248
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
It's better than leaving it empty.

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,680
Chunsheng, you two have a chat.

250
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,960
It's time for Mr. Xiao
to take his medicine.

251
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll help him.

252
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,880
You are dating?

253
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,320
Does she know about our situation?

254
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,680
Yanqiu, Hongling is a good girl.

255
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
She knows everything about our family,

256
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,200
but she doesn't care.

257
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,320
And she has been doing her best
to take care of Dad.

258
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
A good girl indeed.

259
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
Be nice to her.

260
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Don't let her down.

261
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
Take good care of her.

262
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,600
I also want to take good care of her,

263
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,960
but she's about to take
the military art troupe assessment

264
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,960
and go to the army.

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,480
I forgot to ask you.

266
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,240
How is Dad's political appraisal going?

267
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Will it affect your enlistment?

268
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,000
There's no news yet.

269
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
I'll ask again tomorrow.

270
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
The comrade in charge of
the political appraisal called

271
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
and said you gave this opportunity
to someone else.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Dad,

273
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I can neither play the violin nor sing,

274
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,520
why should I join the art troupe?

275
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,560
My dream is to be a doctor.

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
We have discussed this issue already.

277
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
We support you

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
to pursue your dream,

279
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,040
but you should be aware
of the situation now, right?

280
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,600
The Medical School
is currently not recruiting,

281
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
and the places in the army's medical team

282
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,640
are for the children of workers,
peasants and soldiers.

283
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,440
You are just doing those chores

284
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
in the hospital every day.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
It's not promising at all.

286
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,960
Your mother told me that

287
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,040
you have been hanging out
with those little punks

288
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,200
from the military compound.

289
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,720
Xiaomei,

290
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,160
is this your ideal and your dream?

291
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,960
Dad, I'm not doing chores.

292
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,150
That's my job.

293
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm taking responsibility
for protecting people's health.

294
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,840
If everyone

295
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,800
despises my work like you,

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,630
then in this world,

297
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,720
many people will

298
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,080
lose their lives due to

299
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,280
lack of professional care.

300
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440
I want to be a doctor,

301
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,350
but I don't despise my current job.

302
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,630
In my opinion,

303
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
the difference between doctors and nurses

304
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,680
is just in expertise.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
It's the same as the truth

306
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,760
that you are no nobler
than your soldiers.

307
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,920
Besides,

308
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,000
those little punks you talked about

309
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,400
are my friends.

310
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,440
I like them very much.

311
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Unlike you,

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,520
they don't despise
my profession as a nurse,

313
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,320
and they definitely won't

314
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,560
judge my life choice.

315
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,040
How dare you!

316
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
I know what I'm doing in my life,

317
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,560
and I don't need anyone to intervene.

318
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,160
Come back!

319
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,080
You...

320
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,180
(Take the bookmark as a thank-you gift.)

321
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,600
You are up so early.

322
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,280
Why are you up so early?

323
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,760
I have something to do.

324
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
Hongling is still asleep?

325
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Yes.

326
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,640
She is tired.

327
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,880
Just let her sleep.

328
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,640
All right.

329
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,240
You are going out, right?

330
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,120
Yes, I have to go.

331
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,720
OK.

332
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,400
Comrade,

333
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
you have come to see
this violin case several times.

334
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,920
Are you going to buy it or not?

335
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
You know what,

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,320
this is the last one.

337
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,720
I'll take it.

338
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,620
(Nurse Station)

339
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,540
(Physical Examination Form
for Enlisted Personnel)

340
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Guohua,

341
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
this year's enlistment
physical examination has begun,

342
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
can Chunsheng still enlist in the army?

343
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
Chunsheng failed the political appraisal.

344
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,160
I'm afraid he won't make it this year.

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,200
Did you get to know this long ago?

346
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,240
I...

347
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,840
I just got the news.

348
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,100
(State-run Musical Instrument Store)

349
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,900
(Unit One)

350
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
I came to tell you that

351
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,680
Chunsheng failed the political appraisal,

352
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,080
so he can't join the army this year.

353
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,200
You know...

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
Xiaomei is here.

355
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,720
Xiaomei is here
to measure Mr. Xiao's blood pressure.

356
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
Yeah, that's right.

357
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,920
Everything is fine.

358
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,960
He's OK.

359
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,080
That's good.

360
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,040
That's good.

361
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,080
(Xiao Chunsheng
treated Xiaomei to dinner)

362
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
(to thank her for taking care of his dad)

363
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,840
(and giving her spot to Hongling.)

364
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
(Looking at Xiao Chunsheng being drunk,)

365
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
(He Hongling knew that)

366
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,640
(deep in his heart,)

367
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,880
(he was still sorry for
not being able to enlist.)

368
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
(Seeing the brand new violin case,)

369
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
(He Hongling started to waver.)

370
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,600
(She didn't know if she would regret)

371
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,360
(leaving this man
who loved her wholeheartedly)

372
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,920
(for her dream.)

373
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,800
Guohua, have some fruit.

374
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,080
Mrs. He, I'm good.

375
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,520
Just eat.

376
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,400
Thank you, Mrs. He.

377
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
Why do I feel that you are tanned?

378
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,000
I went to Beidaihe
for training some time ago.

379
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,640
I plan to enlist later.

380
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
You are going to join the army?

381
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,640
That's right.

382
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,080
Kids from families like yours

383
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
should enlist as early as possible.

384
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,760
Too bad that

385
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,520
I dragged Hongling down.

386
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,040
Mrs. He, didn't Hongling tell you?

387
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,120
I mean...

388
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
about the surgery.

389
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,560
I told you about
Professor Su before, remember?

390
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
I asked someone

391
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,960
to show him your medical record.

392
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,040
He thinks that after a successful surgery,

393
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,280
you'll have a very good chance
of full recovery.

394
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,160
Really?

395
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,120
If you are willing to take the surgery,

396
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,520
I'll have them come in a few days

397
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
and give you a preoperative
physical assessment.

398
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
That's great.

399
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Guohua, thank you so much.

400
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,640
You are welcome.

401
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,040
Just take a good rest

402
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,680
and don't worry about anything else.

403
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,160
I will contact Professor Su
when I get home.

404
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,440
Guohua, come with me.

405
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
Hongling,

406
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
talk to Guohua nicely.

407
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Don't forget what I told you.

408
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,040
Thank you for what you did, Guohua.

409
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,880
Not at all.

410
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,240
Hongling, why do you look unhappy?

411
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,320
Before

412
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,080
I was worried that
after Chunsheng went to the army,

413
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,960
I would be left alone in Beijing.

414
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,880
But now the situation is reversed.

415
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,360
Hongling,

416
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,640
a violinist's peak period

417
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,800
is very short.

418
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
You know that better than me.

419
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,840
Chunsheng can wait,

420
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,280
but you can't.

421
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,280
And you play the violin really well,

422
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,360
why don't you let more people hear it?

423
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,160
I think

424
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,680
you should think it over.

425
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,880
If you

426
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,000
miss this chance,

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,840
you might never have another one.

428
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,000
You should think about yourself

429
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,920
and your mom.

430
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,960
Dong,

431
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
Hongling is going to

432
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,560
participate in the interview
of the military art troupe.

433
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
If she passes it,

434
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,080
she will join the army.

435
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,280
How is your father's
political appraisal going?

436
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
Why do you guys keep asking me this?

437
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,760
I went to the Revolutionary Committee
this morning to ask about it.

438
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
They told me to wait for the notice.

439
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,080
But earlier,

440
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,080
Mr. Ye told me that

441
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,560
there will be no problem.

442
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
That's good.

443
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,760
Chunsheng,

444
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Hongling is a competitive girl.

445
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,840
If she does something wrong,

446
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,840
you must forgive her.

447
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
Dong,

448
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
what's wrong with you today?

449
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,440
Hey,

450
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
just say it if you have something to say.

451
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,680
The way you are talking

452
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,960
is making me worried.

453
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
Do you remember

454
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,360
Linzi who practiced with me?

455
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,720
You mean the one

456
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,600
who always lost to me?

457
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Well,

458
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
I haven't seen him for some days.

459
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
That's him.

460
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
He has passed the initial examination,

461
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,160
and gone to the army
for a re-examination.

462
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,120
Xiaomei,

463
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,480
what are you doing here?

464
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,120
Chunsheng, nobody dares to tell you this,

465
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,320
but I don't want to hide it from you.

466
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,800
I came to tell you that

467
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
you can't

468
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,880
join the army this year.

469
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,920
I got it.

470
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,440
Thank you.

471
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,200
Chun...

472
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,480
Why did you come back so late?

473
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,280
There's food for you in the kitchen.

474
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
I ate at Dong's place.

475
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,320
The yarn dropped.

476
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
I just promised Xiaomei that

477
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,600
I'd treat her to dinner to thank her

478
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,640
at Moscow Restaurant.

479
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,440
Xiaomei is here.

480
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
Xiaomei is here to measure
Mr. Xiao's blood pressure.

481
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,360
Hongling,

482
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,760
a violinist's peak period

483
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,920
is very short.

484
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,400
Chunsheng can wait,

485
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,920
but you can't.

486
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,080
You should think it over.

487
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,200
Before

488
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,960
I was worried that
after Chunsheng went to the army,

489
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
I would be left alone in Beijing.

490
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,480
But now the situation is reversed.

491
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,860
(Enlistment Notice
Comrade Ye Guohua)

492
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,120
Hongling, you are up.

493
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,080
Come over for breakfast,

494
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,760
and then I will take you
to the examination place.

495
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
I was tired from training last night,

496
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,320
so I just fell asleep.

497
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,920
Hongling,

498
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,920
what's wrong with you?

499
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
What do you mean?

500
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,640
Were you too nervous
to sleep well last night?

501
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,040
Look at your eyes.

502
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,680
You are like a panda.

503
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,520
Don't be nervous.

504
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm with you.

505
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,480
Let's eat.

506
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,040
Mom, I made it!

507
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,560
I'm going to join the army!

508
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
You are joining the army?

509
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,160
You are joining the army?

510
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,240
That's great.

511
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,800
Mom.

512
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,280
Mom, why are you crying?

513
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,840
Because I'm happy.

514
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,160
I'm happy.

515
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,480
My daughter is joining the army.

516
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,360
I am so happy.

517
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,240
You haven't told Chunsheng yet?

518
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,800
I think he knows it already.

519
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
He just doesn't know that

520
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,680
you and I knew about it.

521
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Don't look at me like that.

522
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,480
I admit that I have selfish intentions,

523
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,480
but I really feel sorry for you.

524
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,400
You have practiced the violin
for so many years

525
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,280
just for the chance

526
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,720
to join the art troupe one day.

527
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,800
And I believe that

528
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,080
as long as you join the art troupe,

529
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,400
you will definitely become the best.

530
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,560
Hongling, I did that

531
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,120
for the sake of your dream.

532
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,680
Do I have to leave Chunsheng
to realize my dream?

533
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,080
Hongling, don't get carried away.

534
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,080
I believe
you won't make the wrong decision.

535
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,560
The table's too small.

536
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,960
Let's put two together.

537
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,000
- Put them together.
- Come on.

538
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,640
- Let's put two together.
- Alright.

539
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,520
Come on.

540
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:18,960
Come on.

541
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,040
Hongling.

542
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,710
Come sit here.

543
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,160
Sit down.

544
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,560
OK.

545
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,560
How many bowls do you need?

546
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,000
Let me see.

547
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,080
Who wants two bowls?

548
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,440
- Me.
- And me.

549
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,960
OK, ten bowls of wontons.

550
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Are special requests?

551
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,640
One without coriander.

552
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,750
One without dried shrimps.

553
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,440
One without filling, just wrappers.

554
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,640
Okay, got it.

555
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
I don't like coriander.

556
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,920
Ye Fang doesn't like dried shrimps.

557
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,120
Who is that bowl

558
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,040
without the filling for?

559
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,320
Me.

560
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,360
Chunsheng, I have to say something.

561
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
When did you become

562
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,840
such a picky eater?

563
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,400
You are becoming

564
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,800
more tricky than our young lady

565
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
here.

566
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,080
Am I right?

567
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
What are you saying?

568
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,140
(State-run Public Restaurant)

569
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,440
Chunsheng,

570
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
enjoy what you are eating now.

571
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,360
The food is bad in the army.

572
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,800
You'll have to bear hardships

573
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,120
once you become a soldier.

574
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,640
Come on.

575
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,120
I know you are envious.

576
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
You don't have to talk like that.

577
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,960
What is there to envy?

578
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,400
We will enjoy our good lives in Beijing

579
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,000
while you have to drink rainwater
and eat mud on the battlefield.

580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,720
There's no meat?

581
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,360
Is it good?

582
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,880
Try it.

583
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Chunsheng,

584
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,000
I plan to go to the ace field unit
of the 46th Army.

585
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Where do you plan to go?

586
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
That regiment is quite close
to the art troupe.

587
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,880
Why don't you come with me?

588
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I asked you a question.

589
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Tell us about it.

590
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Where do you plan to go?

591
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,480
I can't go to the army this year.

592
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,280
I wanted to tell you earlier

593
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
but I just didn't.

594
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,360
I failed the political appraisal,

595
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,920
but I don't feel ashamed.

596
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,280
My dad didn't do anything wrong,

597
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,160
and he should not
acknowledge any mistake.

598
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
I can afford to wait.

599
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,000
I know you can.

600
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,880
What about Hongling?

601
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
I support Hongling

602
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,040
to go to the art troupe.

603
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
This is her dream.

604
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,760
I have to support her.

605
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
There's a cheese shop up ahead.

606
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,200
Let's go. Cheese is on me.

607
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,520
Come on, let's go.

608
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,400
Come on.

609
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
About the art troupe,

610
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,080
I made that choice for my own dream.

611
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,640
And Hongling got the chance
fair and square.

612
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,400
It has nothing to do with Ye Guohua.

613
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,840
Don't get stressed about it.

614
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,040
Have a good chat.

615
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
We'll wait for you in the cheese shop.

616
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,800
Chunsheng,

617
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,440
I knew the result before the interview,

618
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,560
but I didn't know how to tell you.

619
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,360
Hongling,

620
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
do you remember what I told you?

621
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,600
This is your life.

622
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,560
You have the right to make any choice.

623
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,280
But I want to be with you.

624
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,000
As long as you stop me,

625
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,880
I will give the art troupe up.

626
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,360
Hongling,

627
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,800
what are you worried about?

628
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,520
I don't want to leave you
at a time like this.

629
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,400
Mr. Xiao is sick.

630
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,480
Yanqiu is busy with work in the factory.

631
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm worried that you can't handle it alone.

632
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
Hongling, I can perfectly handle

633
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
the things you said.

634
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,120
I will take good care of

635
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
not only my family but also your family.

636
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,800
Just go to the army with peace of mind.

637
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,560
And in the army,

638
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,640
you can play the violin
however you want.

639
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,400
You won't have to worry anymore.

640
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,680
When I pass the political appraisal,

641
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,560
I will go to the army for you.

642
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,160
You are still

643
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,760
not saying that sentence.

644
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,480
I thought you felt it
that day on the mountain.

645
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,080
My heart

646
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,840
raced that day.

647
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
I like you.

648
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,600
I should have told you this
a long time ago.

649
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
But I'm also afraid.

650
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,960
Like what I told you before,

651
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,880
the final choice is yours.

652
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,520
Have you made the decision?

653
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,760

00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,440
OK. Alright.

657
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,720

Every day!

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,400
You can't think about that girl
in the stack room again.

660
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,840
And you can't look at other girls.

661
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,640
You can only miss me.

662
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,840
OK. No problem.

663
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,560
I will only miss you.

664
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,800
I'll wait for you to join me in the army.

665
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,800
We've got a deal.

666
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,480

I heard Hongling's house
is being repainted,

675
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,920
so I came to give you a hand.

676
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,680
There's a stool.

677
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,080
Sit down.

678
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,040
Hurry up if you want to apologize.

679
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,440
It's becoming embarrassing.

680
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,640
Why should I apologize?

681
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I still need an explanation.

682
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,240
You agreed to help me court her,

683
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,840
but in the end,
she became your girlfriend.

684
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,440
Don't you think that's wrong?

685
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,960
It's you who said it's a fair competition.

686
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,080
What?

687
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,320
You regretted it after I won?

688
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,920
Moreover,

689
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,360
you also said that
we would still be brothers

690
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
no matter who would win.

691
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,920
Why did you suddenly change?

692
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,200
Ye Fang criticized me yesterday,

693
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,400
saying that I shouldn't
have expected you to let me win

694
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
after challenging you
to a fair competition.

695
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,840
And I shouldn't have used the power
of my family to court Hongling.

696
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,720
I thought about it all night

697
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,560
and she made some sense.

698
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
I'm also responsible for this.

699
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,160
I should have controlled my emotions

700
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,360
while courting her for you.

701
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
I can't blame you.

702
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,280
I remember reading it
in some books that

703
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,280
in this world

704
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
there are three things
that cannot be controlled.

705
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
What are those?

706
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,840
Sneeze, fart,

707
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,560
and love.

708
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,920
Chunsheng,

709
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,120
I now admit that

710
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,880
I lost to you.

711
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,480
Are we still brothers?

712
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,800
Of course.

713
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,240
Get back to your work!
