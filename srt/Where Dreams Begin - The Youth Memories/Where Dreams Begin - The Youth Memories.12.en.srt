3
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,640
Duan Lei.

4
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,560
Well done.

5
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
Be one minute faster
and you would break the record.

6
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,920
I'll keep trying hard.

7
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,840
Xiao Chunsheng.

8
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,880
You did a good job, too.

9
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
You finally broke your own record.

10
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,280
Well done.

11
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Comrade Xiao Chunsheng,

12
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
you passed it.

13
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
But compared to Duan Lei,

14
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,400
you were much slower.

15
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
Platoon Leader Ye,

16
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
give me some more time

17
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,720
and I'll do better than him.

18
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Don't take that personally.

19
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,480
To be honest,

20
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I was three minutes slower
than Duan Lei.

21
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,560
I've never been so frustrated like this.

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,960
Since little,

23
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
you've been the best boy

24
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,560
among us.

25
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
You never knew

26
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,880
how it felt to lose.

27
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,840
I understand

28
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,240
what this means to you.

29
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,640
Actually,

30
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,110
it's not a bad thing.

31
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,060
(Unit One)

32
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,680
What are you doing here?

33
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,600
Waiting for you.

34
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
It's so late. Where have you been?

35
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,040
Where else could I be?

36
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,480
The mill organized for us
to watch synchronized swimming.

37
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,920
I thought you were in the night school.

38
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
I waited at the door for a long while

39
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,360
but didn't see you at all.

40
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,840
Qi Tian,

41
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
don't bother to escort me, seriously.

42
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,440
It's too much trouble for you.

43
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
No trouble at all.

44
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,840
Before leaving, Chunsheng asked me

45
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,160
to take care of you and your father.

46
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,640
I have plenty of time, right?

47
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
Fine. Now that you're back,

48
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm relieved.

49
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Get back home.

50
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,920
I should go.

51
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,640
Bye.

52
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,440
You're back.

53
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
Silly man.

54
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
I'm already yours.

55
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
Why do you still stare like this?

56
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Come.

57
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,880
I was waiting the whole night.

58
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,480
Before you're back,
I couldn't fall asleep.

59
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,840
Come on, hurry.

60
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
Zhao Xiaohui, are you insane?

61
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,680
You're insane!

62
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,520
Tell me.

63
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,120
Today, I saw a man in the natatorium.

64
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
He ran out upon seeing me.

65
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Is he your friend?

66
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Fine.

67
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
Let's talk about this.

68
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,080
Zhao Xiaohui.

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Zhao Xiaohui,

70
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,920
what happened to you
and your coach today?

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,560
Confess!

72
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
What?

73
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
If you don't believe me, what can I say?

74
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,840
Fine, I believe you.

75
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Say it now.

76
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,040
You believe me. Really?

77
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Yes.

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,520
OK. Let me tell you this.

79
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,080
Today, out there,

80
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
nothing happened.

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
So much for this, huh?

82
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,920
Nothing happened?

83
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Then why did that coach stroke you?

84
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
This is nothing?

85
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Explain this!

86
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Heizi,

87
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
from what happened
before we got married,

88
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
you still haven't
learned your lesson, huh?

89
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
You want to know this, right?

90
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,560
Fine. Listen.

91
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,760
Well,

92
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,440
I don't know

93
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,600
what your friend told you.

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,240
Today, we just performed
for workers of the textile mill.

95
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
When it was over,

96
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
the coach handed me a bath towel

97
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,440
and stroked me.

98
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,480
I slapped him immediately

99
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,240
and cursed him.

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,040
Yanqiu was there, too.

101
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,800
If you don't believe me, go ask her.

102
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
That's what happened. I'm done.

103
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,360
I believe you.

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,960
Heizi,

105
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
if you always

106
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,640
suspect me like this,

107
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,920
what fun can you find

108
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,680
in our marriage?

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Xiaohui,

110
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm wrong.

111
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
I just didn't dare to think

112
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
that you would leave me.

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
I told you.

115
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
In my life,

116
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
unless you discarded me,

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,760
I wouldn't leave you.

118
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
What else worries you?

119
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm no longer worried.

120
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,680
Heizi, whatever you think, let me know.

121
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,880
When we live together,

122
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,960
we shouldn't be sulking.

123
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Understand?

124
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes.

125
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,040
Then, let's say it's the last time, OK?

126
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,520
All right. Come up.

127
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
Wait.

128
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,560
What?

129
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,720
You move inside.

130
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Or I couldn't see you.

131
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,120
Go, go.

132
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,640
Move.

133
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,560
Good.

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
Now, I can see you.

135
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,560
The... The coach...

136
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
Where did he stroke you?

137
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,080
Let me check.

138
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't bite me!

139
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,880
Zhao Xiaohui!

140
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,800
I really...

141
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
(Wedding)

142
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
After the operation,
the patient of Bed No.24 has

143
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
(Nurse Station)
pulmonary hypertension

144
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,800
and slight tricuspid regurgitation.

145
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
Last night, as monitored,

146
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,520
his heart rate was around 100.

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
The patient of Bed No.26
was in good condition last night.

148
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,280
He went to the toilet twice.

149
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,800
No chest distress after he walked.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
This morning, his temperature was normal

151
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,160
with clear pulmonary respiration.

152
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
His heart rate is 70,

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
beating regularly without murmur.

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,480
OK. Go back for some rest.

155
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,200
You've got bloodshot eyes.

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
See you tomorrow morning.

157
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,480
See you then.

158
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,920
I should go. See you tomorrow.

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,960
See you tomorrow, Xiaomei.

160
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,960
Xiaomei, knocking off?

161
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
See you tomorrow.

162
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,080
Xiaomei, getting off?

163
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,280
Goodbye.

164
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
See you tomorrow.

165
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,820
(Be united for greater victories)

166
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
There are you, Xiaomei.

167
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes.

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
You're just in time.

169
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,160
Or I would be late.

170
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
I timed it and rushed here.

171
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,280
You must be tired. You're sweating.

172
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,800
It's OK.

173
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I don't know

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
what our leaders were thinking.

175
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,960
They made us go to the night school.

176
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Luckily, you can help.

177
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,160
If my father stayed at home alone,

178
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I would be worried.

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,280
Thank you for these days.

180
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,040
Don't say that.

181
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,320
Chunsheng asked me to take care of you.

182
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
He just talked

183
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,480
and didn't care
whether it was hard for you.

184
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,680
It's not hard.

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
You bought some vegetables?

186
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,400
The money for vegetable shopping

187
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,520
is where it has always been.

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,280
In the cookie tin. Take some yourself.

189
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,520
No hurry.

190
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Mr. Xiao is sleeping?

191
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
I'll go make dinner.

192
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
He'll be hungry when he wakes up.

193
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,960
He has a good appetite recently.

194
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
It means he's getting better.

195
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
Hope so.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I should go.

197
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,560
Wait.

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,440
Yanqiu,

199
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
why do I feel

200
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
you look different today?

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,120
I don't.

202
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,600
You do.

203
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,920
You look prettier.

204
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,120
You're wearing a gorgeous scarf.

205
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,600
When I was shopping in Xidan,

206
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,440
it was on sale.

207
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
Then I bought it.

208
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,440
Looks great.

209
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,320
Wait, Yanqiu.

210
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
You rouged your lips?

211
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,360
No. You saw it wrong.

212
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,560
Yanqiu,

213
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
is anything going on with you?

214
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Qi Tian told me

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
a teacher at the night school...

216
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Don't trust his blab.

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,920
I even hate to think of him.

218
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,360
Now,

219
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
he's like my personal
instructor and commissar.

220
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,680
He keeps asking

221
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
where I go or who I meet.

222
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,400
If I meet a man,

223
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,440
I have to tell him.

224
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Wait and see.

225
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,760
He'll go to the night school tonight.

226
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Why?

227
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Who's he to me?

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,440
Why can he restrain me like that?

229
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Why?

230
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,880
Because your brother asked him to.

231
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,960
I wrote several letters
to complain about this,

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
but he pretended he didn't see.

233
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,440
Come on, he has someone watch me.

234
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
All right. Get going.

235
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Or you'd be late.

236
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,680
Oh,

237
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
I'll take you to a movie this Sunday.

238
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,560
OK.

239
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,560
Thank you.

240
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,440
Mr. Xiao,

241
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
you have a better appetite.

242
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,680
When you eat more, you'll recover soon.

243
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,200
You make delicious dishes.

244
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,680
Better than Yanqiu.

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,360
You're just fed up with her dishes.

246
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,880
Very well.

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,600
We can cook in turn
and make different dishes.

248
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,080
Thank you.

249
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,560
My pleasure.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Don't mention it, Mr. Xiao.

251
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Stay for some rest.

252
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I'll go wash the dishes.

253
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,280
Hongling,

254
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
go back to your room for some rest.

255
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,200
When Ye is back,
have him do the washing.

It's so late.

260
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,240
You should have been in bed

Come on.

When a man like you stands here,

264

what if she sees you and gets annoyed?

265
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,760
I have something to ask Yanqiu.

266
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,840
She's dating a man.

267
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
And why do you care so much?

268
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,720
Tian, do you have a crush on her?

269
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,560
I care about her? I don't.

270
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
I just fear she would be bullied.

271

That's his old disease.

290
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm often mistaken.

291
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,560
He thinks I'm Chen
of the cookhouse squad.

292

to ask you something.

306
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,630
do you think of me?

307
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,630
They came for you, huh?

308
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,280

310

As an educated intellectual,

312
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,840
I don't get along with such loafers.

313
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,320
And I don't know

314
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,080
why a decent girl like you

315
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,320
would have this kind of friend.

316

Yanqiu, what's all this about?

323
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
What do you want?

324
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,560
Nothing.

325
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,240
I just want a talk with Mr. Fan.

Yanqiu,

329
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,720
our business with Mr. Fan

330
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
isn't your concern, either.

332
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,920
asked us to bring him a message.

335
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,240
You must be familiar with this name,

336

aren't you?

337
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720

We get the right guy.

339
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Mr. Fan, your wife,

340
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
Ms. Hu, I mean.

341
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,240
She told me to ask you something.

342
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
It's been three months,

343
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,520
but she and her son

344
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,600
only had 15 yuan for living expenses.

345
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
She wondered

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
who else

347
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
you spent your salary on.

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,360
Man,

350
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,480
you think I'm scamming you, huh?

351
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Here.

352
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,400
Check this.

353
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,240
Return tickets from Beijing to Nanchang.

354
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,840
Coach tickets from Nanchang to Fuzhou.

355
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Still don't understand?

356
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,600
I sent my men to visit your family.

357
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,880
Don't be nervous.

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,960
They went in the name of your school.

359
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,840
And don't be scared.

360
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,600
They didn't speak ill of you.

361
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
If your wife

362
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,040
couldn't get over it and killed herself,

363
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,080
who would be to blame?

364
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Mr. Fan,

365
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,480
is this true?

366
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,760
Yanqiu, this is slander.

367
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,520
I don't know what they're talking about.

368
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,280
Yanqiu,

369
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,120
don't be taken in by this kept man.

370
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
He's married.

371
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,000
He has a wife and a son.

372
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
His son is three years old.

373
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,880
Yanqiu, I love you.

374
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,600
You love more girls than her.

375
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,960
Sunday morning,

376
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,360
the female college girl, right?

377
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
And Sunday afternoon,

378
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,560
the primary school
music teacher in Haidian.

379
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
You quite play the field.

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Fan Jianping,

381
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,360
I don't care

382
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,600
how many wicked ideas you have,

383
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,240
but I'm gonna get them out of your mind.

384
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,000
You're going to graduate, right?

385
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,040
You want to stay in Beijing.

386
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
A job at this school would be better.

387
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
But there are only a few places.

388
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,480
What can you do?

389
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,440
Quickly find a local girl

390
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,280
and marry her.

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
In this way,

392
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,440
your application will be considered.

393
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,360
You!

394
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
During your stay in the countryside,

395
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,480
you got married, right?

396
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,440
Your file wasn't sent there.

397
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
When you came to school,

398
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
the file was then left in Beijing.

399
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,880
So,

400
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,480
in your file, your marriage

401
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
isn't recorded.

402
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,360
Do you know what this is?

403
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
Bigamy.

404
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,760
It's worse than a moral problem.

405
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,800
You'd even break the law!

406
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,640
Theoretically,

407
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,840
I should take you to the police.

408
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,960
At least, I should go to your school

409
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
and tell your school leaders about this.

410
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,040
Sir, it's my fault.

411
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,960
I beg you.

412
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Don't tell my school leaders.

413
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll graduate and have
my job assignment soon.

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
If this is exposed,

415
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,160
my hard study over all these years

416
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
will be wasted.

417
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
And I'll be doomed.

418
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,320
Gentlemen,

419
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
I beg you.

420
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,680
Please be a bigger person

421
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,840
and let me go.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
I won't do this again!

423
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,720
Yanqiu.

424
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
Yanqiu,

425
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,040
may I ask you something?

426
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,360
Not today. She isn't available now.

427
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Yanqiu,

428
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
Xiaohui told me last week,

429
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,840
you watched her swimming performance.

430
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
Did you see her and her coach?

431
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,000
I just wonder if she and that man

432
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,320
have an affair.

433
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,480
Yanqiu,

434
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
don't be sad.

435
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,480
That man isn't worth it.

436
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,640
You'll find a better man.

437
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,280
If I tell you she has an affair,

438
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
what would you do?

439
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,120
Heizi,

440
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,960
can she not leave you

441
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,840
or can you not leave her?

442
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,880
Does every man think

443
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,280
he's great?

444
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,920
Breadwinner?

445
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,800
Or backbone?

446
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,920
Can we not even survive without you?

447
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
I'm telling you this.

448
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,760
Without men, we'd still live a great life.

449
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,120
We don't need

450
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,640
this narcissistic care and entanglement.

451
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
She doesn't have an affair.

452
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,000
But if you keep suspecting her,

453
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,600
maybe she will.

454
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,440
Yanqiu is right.

455
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Yanqiu,

456
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,240
I just didn't want you to get hurt.

457
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,400
Fan Jianping appeared to be a bad guy.

458
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,440
Indeed,

459
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
he isn't a good guy.

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,600
But if you...

461
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,760
If you don't want us

462
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,600
to interfere,

463
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,720
I... I won't.

464
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm serious.

465

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
have to think for others.

473
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,640
But I want you

474
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
to think more for yourself.

475

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,320
I think

478
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,520
you are that kind of person.

479
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,240
I think you should join them.

You belong to their world.

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560

You know what?

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
The other day,
I met Xiaomei in the school.

492
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,520
She's having a hard time.

493
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,560
She has to work and audit our courses

494
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
for the college entrance exam.

495
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
Audit our courses?

496
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,240
Can she understand?

497
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Don't underestimate her.

498
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Since little, she's been interested
in medical science

499
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
and read a lot of books.

500
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
She's even more perceptive
than ordinary college students.

501
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,560
The other day, she audited
Professor Lin's class

502
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
and gave a big compliment.

503
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
She even sighed

504
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,040
that China's medical science

505
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,920
was far more backward
than that of foreign countries.

506
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
I totally agreed.

507
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,320
Teachers in my department

508
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
are leading

509
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,240
a translation project
of foreign literary works.

510
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,560
Now, I just know

511
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,200
that foreign literary works

512
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,960
have broken through realism

513
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
into surrealism,

514
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,800
stream of consciousness, and absurdism.

515
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,040
Recently, we've sorted

516
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,440
some translated books
since the Republic of China.

517
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,880
Then I know

518
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,080
China has

519
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,480
so many great translators.

520
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,800
Oh,

521
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
tonight, I'm not going
to the library with you.

522
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,480
Xiaomei invited me

523
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
to the sharing session of literature.

524
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,440
When it's over,

525
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,880
she'll help Professor Lin to analyze

526
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,560
a theoretical document on anatomy.

527
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,320
I'll help her, too.

528
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,360
I was talking to you. Did you hear?

529
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,000
Think about it. Xiaomei isn't

530
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,760
Professor Lin's real student.

531
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,880
Why is she helping so much?

532
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,800
The college entrance exam is
only a few months away.

533
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
I think she should

534
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,320
spend her time and energy

535
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:06,960
on basic subjects,

536
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,760
like Math, Physics, and Chemistry.

537
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,680
How do you know

538
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,320
she isn't working hard on them?

539
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,500
Someone who really prepares for the Exam

540
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,380
won't waste his time

541
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,620
to be a free helper.

542
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,620
What's she actually doing?

543
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,780
Fooling around.

544
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Chen Hongjun,

545
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,100
if you feel bad, get mad at me.

546
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,500
Don't be so sarcastic.

547
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,420
I just...

548
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,140
What?

549
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,700
Hongjun,

550
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,260
I stopped you for your own good.

551
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,140
Why do you not listen?

552
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,220
It's not that I can't listen.

553
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,100
I always listened, didn't I?

554
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,980
But you have to explain this.

555
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,180
Why can't I run

556
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
for the presidency of the Student Union?

557
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,300
For the election, you'll give a speech.

558
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,780
The president will give more speeches.

559
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,140
You sometimes stutter

560
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,660
and get nervous on the stage.

561
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,220
Can you make it?

562
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,220
But...

563
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,380
In... In this case,

564
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,340
I can practice.

565
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,780
Where there's a will, there's a way.

566
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,700
That's not the key problem.

567
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,980
What is it then?

568
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,460
If you succeed,

569
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,460
you may possibly enter politics

570
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,580
and be an official.

571
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,460
What's wrong with being an official?

572
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,900
Your father is an official, isn't he?

573
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,140
And he's big.

574
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,060
A state cadre.

575
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,140
They're people's servants,

576
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,020
instead of haughty officials
in old times.

577
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,300
You aren't fit for this position.

578
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,860
Why not?

579
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,380
You are

580
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,940
too curious and bold.

581
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,700
But they don't sound

582
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,100
like disadvantages.

583
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
Bold men aren't fit?

584
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,380
Who are fit? Cowards?

585
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,820
You have no idea.

586
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,340
Times will change.

587
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,260
A future cadre

588
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,100
has to hold the service consciousness,

589
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,860
do law-based administration,

590
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,100
and be very responsible.

591
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,380
A bold man like you
would easily get in trouble.

592
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,780
I don't understand.

593
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,860
Just trust me. I have good instincts.

594
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,220
Yes, indeed.

595
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,900
Since you accurately

596
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
predicted the college entrance exam

597
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,220
and showed off your instincts,

598
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
everyone has been awed.

599
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,780
Since then, you give weighty advice

600
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,860
and no one dares to disagree.

601
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,220
You've been reading War and Peace.

602
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,140
Can you understand it?

603
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,380
You not only give weighty advice.

604
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,580
I think you just

605
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,660
look down on people like me.

606
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,420
I was a loafer, so what?

607
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,020
Now, I'm a college student.

608
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,620
It's normal that I read books.

609
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,020
Or do you think

610
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
only privileged students like you

611
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,220
of English major

612
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,660
can read foreign books?

613
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,460
Come on.

614
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,540
Don't push it.

615
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,140
We'll spend our lives together.

616
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,260
Your business is mine

617
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,820
and vice versa.

618
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,340
For something concerning our future,

619
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,060
we should respect each other's opinion

620
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,100
and be very serious.

621
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,980
We're talking about business.

622
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,020
Don't try the sweet talk.

623
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,980
What? You don't like it?

624
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,420
Just listen to me and it won't go wrong.

625
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,980
Fine, fine.

626
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,420
I'll listen to you.

627
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,180
He's trying so hard.

628
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,020
He runs really a lot.

629
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,300
Duan Lei,

630
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,780
is Xiao Chunsheng getting insane?

631
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,660
He doesn't even rest.

632
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,220
Quite risking his life.

633
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,100
This guy

634
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,460
is fierce enough.

635
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,540
Good.

636
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,740
Have some water.

637
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,740
Thanks.

638
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
You're welcome.

639
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,940
I quite admire

640
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,820
your hard-bitten spirit.

641
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,700
When I first came

642
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,700
and knew you were from Beijing,

643
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,940
I thought you didn't

644
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,540
belong in our world.

645
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,980
I disliked you.

646
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,980
Turns out

647
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
I had a bias.

648
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,740
It's OK.

649
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,220
You aren't the only one
who thinks like that.

650
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,020
Many people think of Beijing soldiers

651
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,820
with prejudices.

652
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,420
But to be honest,

653
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,820
an opponent like you

654
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,300
makes me feel good.

655
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,780
I'm ashamed to say this,

656
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,060
but when I was in the military compound,

657
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,900
I never lost to anyone.

658
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,260
You are

659
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,740
the first man that has ever defeated me.

660
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,780
Let's be friends.

661
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,580
(Unit One)

662
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
It's midnight.

663
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,540
Naughty Ye Guohua

664
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,060
and our squad leader

665
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,540
launched an emergency muster.

666
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,100
Luckily, you trained me before.

667
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,060
Since I came,

668
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,580
I've never slept deeply.

669
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm always ready for the muster.

670
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,740
Others weren't as vigilant as me.

671
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,060
(Dear Father)
Some were too deeply asleep to wake up.

672
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,820
Some failed to pack very well

673
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,580
and their things dropped along the way.

674
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,620
The generations are declining.

675
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,420
When I was in the army...

676
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,740
But my daughter-in-law,

677
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,380
my son is stronger than them,

678
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,260
including the guy who wrote this letter.

679
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,300
In this field training,

680
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,220
we hiked for nearly 30 kilometers.

681
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,860
From before dawn to daybreak.

682
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,340
From the camp to the mountain.

683
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,940
Yunnan is

684
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,500
really different from Beijing.

685
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,540
Mushrooms shoot up in the mountains.

686
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,260
They look very weird

687
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,860
and don't even look like mushrooms.

688
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,700
There are all kinds of bugs, too.

689
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,540
At lunch,

690
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
my squad leader roasted some bugs.

691
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,860
A long bug was crisp.

692
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,580
And it tasted good.

693
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,220
But after eating some,

694
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,140
I felt a little bit sick.

695
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
And leeches.

696
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,140
Before I came,

697
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,500
Xiaomei warned me

698
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,780
not to be leeched.

699
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,380
I was leeched, though.

700
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,500
When I found the leech,

701
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,100
it was as thick as three fingers.

702
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,660
My condition wasn't serious.

703
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,900
In worse cases,

704
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,620
some got a few leeches on their shanks.

705
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,620
So, in the second half of the training,

706
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,740
we patted each other

707
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
with the sole of the shoe.

708
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,540
Taking a beautiful fall is better
than wandering aimlessly.

709
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
When he's young,

710
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,460
he should go out and experience more.

711
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,500
Xiaomei, it's you.

712
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,100
I just read
Chunsheng's letter to Mr. Xiao.

713
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,540
Sorry for the trouble.

714
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Didn't I tell you

715
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,260
to review your lessons
and not to come often?

716
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,060
I just come once a week

717
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
to take his blood pressure.

718
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,180
No trouble at all.

719
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,380
Do you not want me to eat here?

720
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,700
Tell me what you would like to eat.

721
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,540
I'll make it for you.

722
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,300
I love

723
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,100
the tomato and egg noodles you make.

724
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,220
Wait. I'll make some for you.

725
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,580
How are you preparing for the Exam?

726
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,860
Not bad.

727
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,100
Yanqiu,

728
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,100
have you been to another city?

729
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,580
Does Beidaihe count?

730
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,060
Why did you ask?

731
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,780
When reading Chunsheng's letter,

732
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,420
I found it fun.

733
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,300
Compared to them,

734
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,420
I'm like a frog in the well.

735
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,340
The society isn't what it used to be.

736
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,900
We no longer

737
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,180
have to be restricted

738
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,140
in this small place.

739
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,100
Not only Beijing,

740
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,060
but all the other cities.

741
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,420
You can go anywhere you want.

742
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,140
Don't be jealous of him.

743
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,500
When you finish college,

744
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,380
you'll see a bigger world than him.

745
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,300
People like me can't go anywhere.

746
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,660
But you still have chances.

747
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,580
A bigger world is waiting for you.

748
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,340
As long as we want to go out,

749
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,140
we can go out at any time.

750
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,780
Actually...

751
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,100
Actually, I'm jealous of you guys.

752
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,500
You're young

753
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,580
and have plenty of chances.

754
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,500
When I was young,

755
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,300
I could be nothing but a worker.

756
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,740
At this age,

757
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
I don't have a career

758
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,180
or a husband.

759
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,620
Life is really hard.

760
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,860
Not getting along well

761
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,540
with the teacher of the night school?

762
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,580
You should ask Qi Tian,

763
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,940
the instructor and commissar
my brother got me.

764
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,020
Mr. Fan failed the political appraisal.

765
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,060
Tian did that as a favor.

766
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,420
What favor?

767
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,020
Who needs that?

768
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
My brother is to blame.

769
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,260
He insists on having me watched.

770
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,220
No way.

771
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
The more I think, the angrier I get.

772
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,460
Are you finished?

773
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,140
I'll go wash the dishes.

774
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,460
Go to Chunsheng's bedroom

775
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,340
for some paper and a pen.

776
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,740
I'll write to criticize him.

777
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,460
You do it with me.

778
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,740
What a man he got me!

779
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,180
He can't play cards.

780
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,860
You know what?

781
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,940
(Porter, Loader, Garbage transporter)

782
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,420
He'll lose.

783
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,180
Come on, sir.

784
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
What work do you have?

785
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,100
Sand sieving and plastering.

786
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,700
We guys can do that.

787
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,860
OK.

788
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,900
Ten hours.

789
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,940
No lunch.

790
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:32,980
Come on.

791
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,260
Another poor job.

792
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,820
We can earn very little money.

793
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,700
And you don't even offer lunch.

794
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,100
Guys, break up. Go.

795
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,380
Let's wait for bigger jobs.

796
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,300
You can hardly get a worker.

797
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,620
Let's continue the cards.

798
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,580
Go on.

799
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,260
Sir,

800
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,780
I'll take the job.

801
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,100
OK.

802
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,220
Go.

803
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:48,940
Go.

804
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,460
One, two, three, four.

805
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,300
You're asked to rest more
but you never listen.

806
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,140
Mr. Xiao.

807
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,620
Oh, Qi Tian.

808
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,860
What are you up to?
Haven't seen you for days.

809
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,340
Just fussing around.

810
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,940
How are you doing?

811
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,860
Good.

812
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,420
But she always restrains me.

813
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,540
When you're here, I can take a breath.

814
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,740
Fed up with me, huh?

815
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,300
What do you think?

816
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,580
I'm going back to my room for some rest.

817
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,100
Didn't I tell you not to waste money?

818
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,580
Why did you buy some many things again?

819
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,060
After the training for three months,

820
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,260
all of you

821
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,340
have become

822
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,820
basically standard Chinese soldiers.

823
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,540
Comrades,

824
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,340
your life as recruits will soon be over.

825
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,460
Soon,

826
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,100
you're going

827
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,180
to different field forces.

828
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,580
The Company decided

829
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,700
to give you two days off

830
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,140
so that you could get enough rest!

831
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,220
Thank you, Mr. Ye!

832
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,780
- Nice!
- Yeah!

833
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,740
All of you!

834
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,940
Dismiss!

835
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,700
- Here we go!
- Go!

836
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,940
Chunsheng.

837
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,620
Go visit Hongling.

838
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,860
It's been a long time.

839
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,620
OK. I'm on my way.

840
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,060
(Serve the People)

841
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,260
Hongling.

842
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,740
What?

843
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,580
Someone asked to see you.

844
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,780
Who?

845
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,340
There he is.

846
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,460
