3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Then he left us.

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,000
You don't want us. Fine.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,480
But don't give us away.

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,920
He entrusted us to you

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,800
and asked us to listen to you.

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,280
For what?

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,480
Heizi,

10
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,480
you are too simple. That's your problem.

11
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,200
And that's why
Tian was worried about you,

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
and entrusted you to me.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,160
Don't you know that?

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Heizi, the police are here.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
So what?

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,480
Why do I care?

17
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,480
What's going on?

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
Everything is fine, officer.

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
They are just here

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
to buy something.

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,120
It's alright.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Nothing happened.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
I don't care if they're customers.

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
I will arrest whoever makes trouble.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,000
You are so right, officer.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Do not worry.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
We never make trouble.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,720
We'll leave now, OK?

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,360
Let's go.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,440
- Let's go.
- Look. Everything's fine.

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Nothing happened at all.

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,760
I will come to you again.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
Violin solo,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Under the Silver Moonlight.

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,680
Performer, He Hongling.

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,340
He Hongling? Have you heard of her before?

37
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,180
(Welcome Performance for New Recruits)

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
She's my friend.

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,280
You all did a great job tonight.

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
You must control your emotion well.

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Secretary Li.

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
Long time no see, Secretary Li.

43
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
How have you been doing?

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,430
Are you here for me?

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
You did pretty well just now.

46
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,960
Take a break.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
Where have you been?

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
I've been at a grassroots unit
for half a year.

49
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,080
I just came back.

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
No wonder you are so tan.

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,280
He looks better this way.

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
I think he was more handsome earlier.

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,640
All right, see you around.

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,440
Okay.

55
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,680
Mrs. Huang.

57
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Secretary Li.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,560
Your troupe's performance
is getting better and better.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,480
Yeah?

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
Then you should come more often.

61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Is this

62
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,000
the violinist just now?

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
Her name is He...

64
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,360
He Hongling.

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,200
Yes.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,480
He Hongling.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
Let me introduce you.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,360
This is Comrade He Hongling.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
She's new here.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
And she's a great violinist.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,760
More importantly,

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,680
the soldiers love her performance.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,800
You have seen it just now.

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,560
You are right.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Then you should let more people know.

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Comrade He Hongling,

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,360
my name is Li Dongzheng.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm the propaganda secretary here.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,920
Nice to meet you.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,960
Nice to meet you.

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Hongling.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Guohua.

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,000
This is Secretary Li
from the Propaganda Department.

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
This is my good friend.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,200
Ye Guohua.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Li Dongzheng?

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,880
It's been a long time!

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah, a long time indeed.

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
You know each other?

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,640
We grew up in the same compound.

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,320
Later his father
was transferred to the South,

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
and he moved with him.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,360
I think we haven't seen each other
for almost six years.

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,480
It's five years.

96
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,720
Not bad, Guohua.

97
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,680
Good for you.

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
What do you mean?

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,560
Hongling is a keeper.

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,280
She is Chunsheng's girlfriend.

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
Xiao Chunsheng?

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
How has he been?

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,440
Didn't he join the army with you?

105
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,000
I thought you were inseparable.

106
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,280
Secretary Li,
are you here for something?

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,080
Yeah.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,080
It's about
the Military Region Newspaper.

109
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,200
We plan

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
to publish an interview

111
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
about the newly issued

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,600
cultural policy.

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,240
So I want to talk to some

114
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,240
representative personnel.

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm just a new recruit.

116
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,320
You should find
some really capable people.

117
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Li Dongzheng and I

118
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,920
have known each other since childhood.

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,320
It's not that I'm prejudiced against him,

120
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
but he has been mischievous

121
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,960
since he was a child.

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
And he's vain.

123
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
Back then,

124
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,520
he looked down upon everyone,

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,840
and he was a big bully.

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,160
Did he bully you?

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,960
Me?

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,640
Did you and Chunsheng bully him?

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,360
Li Dongzheng

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
liked bragging

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
and showing off back then,

132
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,360
so Chunsheng taught him many lessons.

133
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
Later, as soon as he saw Chunsheng,

134
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,000
he would run away.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,800
You guys always bully people.

136
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
We didn't bully him.

137
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,760
You just don't know how arrogant he was.

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
He asked for it.

139
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
First, it was Ye Guohua,

140
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
and now it's Secretary Li.

141
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
What's so good about her?

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Do they like her pretty face

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,640
or her family background?

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,760
I don't think
she looks particularly beautiful.

145
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,760
It's just so-so.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,480
You are right.

147
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
And she doesn't play the violin so well.

148
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,440
I think Chen Can is better than her.

149
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
No, I'm not.

150
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,400
Well...

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Let's go out.

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Hongling, I heard that

153
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,880
you are the daughter of Deputy Director He
of the General Political Department.

154
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
He Hongling, are you free today?

155
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,680
No.

156
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,920
Hongling is so proud that

157
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
she thinks you are
not good enough for her.

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
Did she tell you that?

159
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,710
Mengmeng, please hold it for me.

160
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,800
I'm going to speak to Mrs. Huang.

161
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,560
OK.

162
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
She's showing off again.

163
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,160
Excuse me. Excuse me.

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,200
Excuse me.

165
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
You can't jump the queue.

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
Come on.

167
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm serious.

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,320
You can't jump the queue.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,280
I'm not.

170
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
I was in front of you a moment ago.

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
She's right, Chen Can.

172
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,600
What's wrong with you?

173
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
But she left.

174
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,440
I just went out for a little while

175
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,840
to talk to Mrs. Huang.

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,520
And I left my lunch box to Mengmeng.

177
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
You think I'm afraid of Mrs. Huang?

178
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,520
Your lunch box
can't replace you in the line.

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
Why are you being unreasonable?

180
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,480
It's you who's being unreasonable.

181
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,160
You wanted to keep your spot
in line with a lunch box.

182
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,160
If everyone is like you,

183
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,520
the whole canteen will be a mess.

184
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,460
- Don't try to fool anyone again.
- Give it to me.

185
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
Liar.

186
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,400
What did you say?

187
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,560
You heard me.

188
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,920
Who did you call a liar?

189
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
You know that the best.

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,280
Can you stop talking like that?

191
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,440
Who did I lie to?

192
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
Is your father Deputy Director He
of the General Political Department?

193
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,320
No.

194
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,680
You pretended to be his daughter,

195
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,920
aren't you a liar by doing that?

196
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,280
When and where did I say

197
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,960
I was his daughter?

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Did you hear it?

199
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,560
Of course I didn't hear it
with my own ears.

200
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,920
Who heard it then?

201
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,120
That's what everyone says.

202
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,040
Someone must have heard it.

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,760
Who?

204
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,520
Stop denying it!

205
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120
Who would say that except for you?

206
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,400
Who would say that to make you look good?

207
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Moreover,

208
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,040
it's been around for so long,

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,080
don't you know it?

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,240
Why don't you refute the rumors?

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,200
I don't have time for that.

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,040
That's silly.

213
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,240
You just want others
to think that way, right?

214
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,480
OK, I'll queue up again.

215
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Chen Can,

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
go and sit in Hongling's seat.

217
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
What are you waiting for?

218
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Hurry up.

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
Let's start.

220
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,040
Good.

221
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm just thinking

222
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
maybe we can try to
let Chen Can take your place

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,080
as the concertmaster.

224
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,200
Hello.

225
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Yes, it's me.

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes.

227
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,960
What?

228
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,880
Body temperature?

229
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,320
38.9 degrees.

230
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,040
It's dropped.

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,080
(Keep Quiet)
Her vomiting and diarrhea?

232
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
They are gone temporarily.

233
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,160
Blood pressure and heart rate?

234
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,040
All normal.

235
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
The drug for flexneri
is still out of stock?

236
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,920
The Cuban one?

237
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,440
Right.

238
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,600
It's been out of stock for a while.

239
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,680
Give her sorbitol in half an hour.

240
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Dr. Wang, Bed No. 17 has a problem.

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,760
Coming!

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,680
Hongling.

243
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm here, Hongling.

244
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
Chunsheng. Chunsheng.

245

247
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
How do you feel?

248
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
I feel better now.

249
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,120
Where is the nurse?

250
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
Your infusion is running out,

251
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,400
but no nurse is around.

252
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,400
She was with me just now.

253
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,200
I felt it in a daze.

254
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Unbelievable.

255
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,640
Although the hospital is full,
they shouldn't put you in the hallway.

256
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,440
I'll try to talk to them.

257
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Have some rest.

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,720
Mr. Niu, is there a letter for me?

259
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,800
No.

260
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,160

Stop it!

344
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,630
Chunsheng.

345
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,480
Chunsheng.

346
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,760
Xiao Chunsheng, why are you everywhere?

347
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
I warn you,

348
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,680
stay out of this. It's not your turn yet!

349
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,520
Heizi, what do you want?

350
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Just say it.

351
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
What do I want?

352
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,520
I don't know if I can

353
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,560
have this eye back.

354
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll take one of his eyes,

355
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,320
or

356
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
I'll stab you with a sharpened steel tube

357
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
as Tian said,

358
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
and then we will be even.

359
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,740
(Welcome to the Participants
of the 1977 College Entrance Examination)

360
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,120
Thank you.

361
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Thank you.

362
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,520
Your admission ticket, please.

363
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,120
Good luck.

364
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,920
Let me see.

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OK, good luck.

366
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Thanks.

367
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,360
Go for it.

368
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,040
Okay, thank you.

369
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,640
See?

370
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,920
This is your best friend.

371
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,080
You think he'll save you?

372
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,240
Do it.

373
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,400
Chunsheng.

374
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,520
No, Chunsheng.

375
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,720
Chunsheng.

376
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,600
Chunsheng.

377
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,840
You...

378
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,400
Heizi,

379
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,400
it must be Xiaohui who told him.

380
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,280
Chunsheng!

381
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Chunsheng.

382
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,720
Chunsheng. Chunsheng. Chunsheng.

383
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,080
Chunsheng.

384
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,160
Xiao Chunsheng, you are a real man.

385
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,440
- This matter is over.
- Chunsheng.

386
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,880
Go! You are running late.

387
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,440
You will always be my big brother.

388
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
No time for that.

389
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,680
Fang is waiting for you.

390
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Go now.

391
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
(Invigilator)
Girl, the bell is ringing for the last time.

392
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,120
There's no time.

393
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,280
Get in or you'll be late.

394
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,240
Come on.

395
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,760
Chunsheng.

396
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm fine. Come on!

397
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,960
Hongjun, what took you so long?

398
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,640
Don't dawdle, just go in.

399
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,000
Come on.

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Wait a minute.

401
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,360
Your admission ticket.

402
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,200
Admission ticket.

403
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,980
(Examination Admission Ticket
Chen Hongjun)

404
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,320
OK. Get in now.

405
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,400
Come on.

406
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Good luck!

407
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,120
Get in now.

408
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,560
Come on.

409
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,880
You're awake.

410
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,840
Xiao... Xiaomei?

411
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,160
Why are you here?

412
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm the nurse on duty
at the exam place near here.

413
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
Someone found you on the ground

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,160
and sent you here.

415
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,960
You are really treating me now.

416
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,520
Fortunately, the wound is not deep.

417
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,680
The bleeding has been stopped.

418
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,640
It was close.

419
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,520
Don't let this happen again.

420
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,080
I also don't want this to happen again.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,280
Now I just want both of them

422
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,760
to be admitted to a good university.

423
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,880
That way, my wound would not be in vain.

424
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,040
By the way,

425
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,680
Ye Fang and Hongjun

426
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,120
came to visit you after the morning exam,

427
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,280
but you were not awake,

428
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
so they went back for the afternoon exam.

429
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,640
Are you hungry?

430
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,400
Here, eat something.

431
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,760
Well, I'm a little hungry indeed.

432
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,960
Thank you, Xiaomei.

433
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,340
(See you in the boiler room at 3:00 p.m.)

434
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm sorry for what you experienced.

435
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
You did that to me.

436
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,320
Yes, I know.

437
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,880
But it doesn't mean I don't feel sorry.

438
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,320
You are bold.

439
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm not that bold.

440
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,760
It took me half a day

441
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,000
to nerve myself.

442
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,960
My heart is still racing.

443
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,160
Feel it if you don't believe me.

444
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,360
Let go of my hand!

445
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,480
You hate me,

446
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,840
right?

447
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,880
What do you think?

448
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,200
That's good.

449
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,480
That means you care about me.

450
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Listen,

451
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,280
Heizi is simple.

452
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,880
He really treats you like a brother.

453
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,840
I can't believe

454
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,920
you are still thinking about him.

455
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,440
He is just a simpleton

456
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,240
who is not good enough for you.

457
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,160
See?

458
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
What did you get for being loyal to him?

459
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,680
I know

460
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,320
they are very kind,

461
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
but they are also so stupid

462
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,640
that they prefer to believe lies.

463
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
We are smart people.

464
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,040
We'll just tell them

465
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,320
what they like to hear.

466
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,160
They will be happy this way,
isn't it good?

467
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,120
You should learn your lesson.

468
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,800
OK.

469
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,720
Enough of this.

470
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,960
Let me tell you something serious.

471
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,360
Xiaohui,

472
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,840
since the first time I saw you,

473
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
I've never stopped thinking about you.

474
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,120
And I miss you crazily every day.

475
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,720
I want to be with you.

476
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,960
Li Shangyou,

477
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,040
you are too confident.

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,720
Sooner or later
you will die because of this.

479
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,640
It doesn't matter.

480
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm willing

481
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
to die for you.

482
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,000
OK.

483
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,240
May your wish come true.

484
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,440
Heizi. Heizi!

485
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,360
This is too much.

486
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,200
We can't eat so much.

487
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,520
It's a waste.

488
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,760
I told her that,

489
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,400
but I couldn't stop her.

490
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,360
What are you doing, Fang?

491
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
Showing off?

492
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,800
You can take the leftovers back

493
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,320
for Mr. Xiao and Yanqiu.

494
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
We have been overworking recently,

495
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
so we need to

496
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
eat something good.

497
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,640
That's true.

498
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,480
Hongjun have lost
several kilograms of weight.

499
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,320
Come on, Hongjun,

500
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
have some meat.

501
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,840
I'm alright.

502
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,400
Here.

503
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,480
Thank you, Chunsheng.

504
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,720
Chunsheng is not recovered yet.
He needs nutrition.

505
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,800
I... I'm fine.

506
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,880
I'm good.

507
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
Chunsheng,

508
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,680
I have to toast you.

509
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,160
If it hadn't been for you that day,

510
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,160
- I would have...
- Hongjun, stop.

511
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,800
What are you doing?

512
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,000
We have always been
looking after each other like this.

513
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
No,

514
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,160
it's different this time.

515
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,400
If I can't pass the exam,

516
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
we can forget it.

517
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,480
But if I really pass it,

518
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,680
I will owe you

519
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,280
a big one.

520
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
So I have to thank you.

521
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,040
Hongjun, cut it out.

522
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,760
Don't worry about it.

523
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,440
We are brothers.

524
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,800
Come on, let's drink.

525
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
- Cheers.
- Wait a minute.

526
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,160
What?

527
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,120
What's wrong with you?

528
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,080
Hongjun did well in the exam.

529
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,400
He will definitely pass it.

530
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Fang is always reliable.

531
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
I believe what she said.

532
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,640
I also think I'll make it.

533
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,480
I really want to enter Peking University.

534
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,120
I think their Chinese Language Department

535
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,800
is particularly good.

536
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,640
Good.

537
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,160
What about you, Fang?

538
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,840
Fang wants to enter
the Foreign Language Department.

539
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
She is good at English.

540
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,720
That's great!

541
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,120
Come on, let's have a toast.

542
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
That's why we need to thank you.

543
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,360
Stop saying that, come on.

544
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,840
Fang,

545
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,680
there's something I need to figure out.

546
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,920
Are you thanking me

547
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,120
for Hongjun

548
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,880
or for yourself?

549
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,760
For myself.

550
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,560
That means

551
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,120
you think I'm a good person.

552
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,400
Certainly.

553
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,000
So you mean

554
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,040
it's good for Hongjun

555
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,440
to have a friend like me?

556
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,360
Did you hear that?

557
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
She has changed her opinion.

558
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,040
I remember that not long ago,

559
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,520
if I'm not wrong,

560
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,520
it was on Guohua's birthday.

561
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,000
At that table. Hongjun, was it that table?

562
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,560
I remember it was that table.

563
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,480
That's it, right?

564
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,920
What did you say that day?

565
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,440
Did you say that

566
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,920
Hongjun did nothing

567
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,800
but fighting and chasing girls all day

568
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,440
when he was with me?

569
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,960
Don't push it.

570
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,240
Do you want me to help you remember

571
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
your glorious past?

572
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,360
- No, no, don't.
- No.

573
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,880
That's not necessary.

574
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,560
- Fang.
- No need.

575
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
Stop talking if you don't want me

576
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,560
to die of shame.

577
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Come on.

578
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,920
Let's have another toast.

579
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,200
Come on.

580
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,160
Cheers.

581
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
University,

582
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,560
I am coming!

583
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,920
Be careful and watch your steps.

584
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
It's okay, I'm happy today.

585
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,560
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

586
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,240
Xiaomei, why didn't you
take the college entrance examination?

587
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Did the hospital stop you?

588
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
They are very supportive,

589
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,280
but our hospital
is really short of manpower now.

590
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
I want to take the exam later.

591
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm being stupid, right?

592
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,760
No,

593
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,000
not at all.

594
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,400
Instead,

595
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,040
I think you made the right choice.

596
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,240
There are always
some people in this world

597
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,280
who put others' interests first.

598
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
And I believe

599
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,920
you will be a very good doctor

600
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,720
in the future.

601
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,240
You too can be

602
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
an excellent soldier.

603
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,600
Thank you.

604
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,320
How dare you!

605
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,720
Beat him!

606
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
Who do you think you are?

607
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,760
You one-eyed punk!

608
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Look at yourself!

609
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
I have raised such a good girl,

610
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,560
how can I let you get her?

611
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,240
Beat him!

612
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,520
Beat him hard!

613
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,400
I told you to keep an eye on him,

614
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,720
but you ignored me!

615
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,000
You are also responsible.

616
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,760
Heizi, Heizi.

617
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,200
Do you want to marry me?

618
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,960
Yes.

619
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,720
I can't hear you. Louder.

620
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,640
Yes!

621
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,560
What did you say? Yes?

622
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
Yes?

623
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,960
Then bear with it.

624
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,280
Let me tell you.

625
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,640
These are all family.

626
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,120
Your future father-in-law
and brothers-in-law.

627
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,160
It's not shameful to be beaten by them.

628
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,360
Yes, I know.

629
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
Dad, listen to me,

630
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,280
you must beat him hard today.

631
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,720
You'd better beat him to death,

632
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,080
and then,

633
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,360
you will either be executed

634
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
or imprisoned.

635
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,760
And I

636
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,560
will be rid of all trouble.

637
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,600
I'll find another man, big deal!

638
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,680
This world is filled with men.

639
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,360
Come on, don't beat him so hard.

640
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,960
Stop it! Stop!

641
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,840
Why did you stop?

642
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,360
Listen,

643
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,560
if you don't kill him today,

644
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
he will be my husband in the future.

645
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,280
Look, he has only one eye left now.

646
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,320
He might lose an arm or a leg in a while,

647
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,440
or have a concussion or something.

648
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
I don't care

649
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,480
if you don't care.

650
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,800
Xiaohui,

651
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,960
are you determined to marry him?

652
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
What's so good about him?

653
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,520
There's nothing good about him
but I like him.

654
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,960
Wait.

655
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
Tell me, how long will you like him?

656
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,560
I know you very well!

657
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Looks like we have wasted our strength.

658
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,360
Yes!

659
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,160
She will like someone else soon.

660
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,920
That's right.

661
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,120
Since you mentioned that,

662
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,320
okay.

663
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,440
Today,

664
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,240
our whole family is here,

665
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,560
and our neighbors are also here.

666
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,520
I swear in front of everyone,

667
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,800
including Heizi,

668
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,440
that I, Zhao Xiaohui,

669
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,720
will never leave Heizi.

670
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,840
As long as he doesn't kick me out,

671
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120
I'll be with him all my life.

672
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,520
I, Zhao Xiaohui,

673
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,240
will keep your word.

674
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
Dad, look at her!

675
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,680
Heizi,

676
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,520
do you want to marry me?

677
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,240
Yes! It's my dream!

678
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,920
OK.

679
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,160
We'll get a marriage certificate later.

680
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,280
OK!

681
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,800
Mr. Hu. Mr. Hu!

682
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't just stand there.

683
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,120
I need to borrow your cart

684
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,800
to send him to the hospital.

685
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,720
No problem!

686
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,200
I'll get it now!

687
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,920
What are you doing?

688
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
You want me to take him to the hospital?

689
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,520
You beat him up,
who else should do that?

690
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,460
(Long live our great Party
Long live the great unity of the world)

691
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,360
Chunsheng.

692
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,560
I don't know
what Zhao Xiaohui is thinking.

693
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,240
Heizi lost one eye,

694
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,840
but now she's gonna

695
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,480
marry him.

696
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,320
Would you do that?

697
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,360
Where does she see in Heizi?

698
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,160
Beat me.

699
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
Chunsheng,

700
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,800
Zhao Xiaohui is flirtatious.

701
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,960
Look at the way she walks.

702
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
She's not a good girl after all.

703
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
Alright, stop.

704
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,840
Don't talk about people
behind their backs.

705
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,800
Heizi's eye

706
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,840
has something to do with us.

707
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,880
I feel very sorry.

708
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,320
Now Xiaohui is going to marry Heizi,

709
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm happy for him.

710
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,880
We're completely done with Heizi.

711
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,560
Chunsheng.

712
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,750
Xiaomei? What a coincidence.

713
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
I was just passing by.

714
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,710
I thought I saw you

715
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,520
and it's really you.

716
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,600
I just sent something to my master.

717
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,520
Come here. Sit down.

718
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,800
Where did you go?

719
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
I went to Fang's university for a lecture.

720
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,200
The university life

721
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,320
is amazingly colorful.

722
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,840
You want to go to university?

723
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,520
I know what I want now.

724
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,840
What is it?

725
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,960
Practice is the sole criterion
for testing truth.

726
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,640
All I need now is practical experience.

727
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,560
Studying in a university
is just a matter of time.

728
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,640
How have you been lately?

729
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,280
Me?

730
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,960
I have been the same.

731
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
Every day is the same for me.

732
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,440
I work at the cooperative during the day,

733
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,200
practice boxing with Dong after work,

734
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,760
and read books at home at night.

735
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,520
It's a pity that

736
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,160
the stack room of the
neighborhood committee was closed.

737
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,920
I have no access to a lot of books now.

738
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,480
Your daily life is colorful.

739
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,120
It's an association of activity and inertia.

740
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,200
It's not as colorful as yours for sure.

741
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,960
Look at you.

742
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,840
You have been working hard
for your dream.

743
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,000
You take college lectures,

744
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,840
read books and work at the hospital.

745
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,600
I can't compare to you.

746
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Then let's see
who can fulfill the dream first.

747
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,280
OK.

748
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,480
By the way,

749
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,040
do you have anything else to do later?

750
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,440
OK, come with me.

751
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,040
Our supply and marketing cooperative
just got a batch of candies.

752
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
I saved a pack for you.

753
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
I can't accept it for nothing.

754
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,000
Come on.

755
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,080
My sister said that

756
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,640
you came to our house every week
to take care of my dad,

757
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,160
so she wanted to thank you.

758
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
Since it is Yanqiu's idea,

759
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
I'll receive it.

760
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,480
What are you talking about?

761
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
It's me who saved it for you.

762
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,320
Hongling.

763
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,360
Guohua.

764
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,600
Are you better now?

765
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,680
I have recovered.

766
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,000
My training with the recruit company
is almost over.

767
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
An old comrade-in-arms
of my dad's is here,

768
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
so he called me over

769
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,840
to talk to me about

770
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,120
my plan for the future.

771
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,160
That's why I came to visit you.

772
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,560
It's nice to have a good family.

773
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,280
There are people
who can help you in everything.

774
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,360
Hongling, don't get me wrong.

775
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm not securing advantages
through my family.

776
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,480
Moreover,

777
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,320
I rank first in every training subject

778
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,160
in the recruit company.

779
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,800
Many troops are vying for me

780
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,360
Of course.

781
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,720
You are so talented,
you should have a good future.

782
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,000
Let's not talk about me.

783
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,880
How have you been?

784
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
Not bad.

785
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,280
Have you contacted Chunsheng?

786
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
Yes.

787
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,480
But I have been busy recently,

788
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,040
so I didn't write to him
as much as before.

789
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,680
By the way,

790
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,240
do you still remember Li Dongzheng?

791
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
Yes, what's the matter?

792
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
He went to our company days ago,

793
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
saying he would report on our deeds.

794
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,480
He took a lot of photos for us,

795
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
and said that

796
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,800
he would put some of the top soldiers
on the Military Region Newspaper.

797
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,440
Guohua,

798
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,520
will it help to have your photos
put on that newspaper?

799
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,480
Of course!

800
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,040
That'll be of great help, Hongling.

801
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,520
The Military Region Newspaper is
the most important one in our military region.

802
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,840
Only the best commanders

803
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
of each troop

804
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,520
can be reported by it.

805
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,800
As long as you make it,

806
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,160
everyone will look at you
with admiration.

807
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,680
Is that helpful enough to you?

808
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,640
But why did you ask that?

809
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,400
Nothing.

810
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,200
You said you were gonna be on it,

811
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,040
so I'm happy for you.

812
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't think he's serious.

813
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,320
And I don't even know
if I'm qualified or not.

814
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,600
Alright, it's getting late.

815
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
I'd better leave now.

816
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,680
OK.

817
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,840
I'll be here

818
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,040
for a few more days.

819
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,040
I'll come to visit you when I'm free.

820
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,520
Goodbye, Comrade He Hongling.

821
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,000
Goodbye.

822
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,240
Show me that score later, please.

823
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,080
Okay.

824
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,640
There you are.

825
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,760
Get in the car.

826
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,520
Why did he come to pick her up?

827
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,000
- Do you know that guy?
- What's he doing here?

828
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,560
He came especially to pick her up.

829
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,360
Yeah.

830
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,400
I've never been in a car like this.

831
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,800
Let's go.

832
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,400
Are you tired?

833
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,360
A little bit.

834
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,800
Taking pictures is always tiring.

835
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,120
Can I get the photos
when the films are developed?

836
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,800
Of course.

837
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,120
I'll give you a lot.

838
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,480
Thanks.

839
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,400
You're welcome.

840
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,240
You said you could put me
on the Military Region Newspaper?

841
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,640
No.

842
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
At least not now.

843
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,200
That requires a chance.

844
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,000
It is not run by me after all.

845
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,040
Isn't that Ye Guohua?

846
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,120
He's here.

847
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,160
This is going to be good.

848
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
Comrade Ye, you are still waiting?

849
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
Forget it,

850
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,040
He Hongling went to spend the weekend
with Secretary Li.

851
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,200
Comrade,

852
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,440
you should speak responsibly.

853
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,640
How could He Hongling
go out with Secretary Li?

854
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,520
We all saw it with our own eyes.

855
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,000
In the morning,
she left in Secretary Li's jeep.

856
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,840
Am I right?

857
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
- Yes.
- We all saw that.

858
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,640
We all saw it.

859
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
Isn't this Ye Guohua?

860
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,720
Guohua, why are you here?

861
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,920
Why are you with him?

862
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,920
Secretary Li took me to take pictures,

863
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,760
saying that he would put them
on the Military Region Newspaper.

864
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,360
I've pretty much said all I need to say.

865
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,960
The rest is up to you, Hongling.

866
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,600
However, Ye Guohua,

867
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,960
you are not his boyfriend.

868
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,560
What are you doing here?

869
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,360
Don't tell me you also like Hongling.

870
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,960
Does Xiao Chunsheng know about this?

871
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,720
I...

872
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
Guohua! Stop it!

873
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Let go.

874
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,200
Let go.

875
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,280
Okay, take your time.

876
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,560
I need to go.

877
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,960
Wait a minute.

878
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,600
How tall are you, Li Dongzheng?

879
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm 1.83 meters.

880
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,600
Guohua is 1.8 meters.

881
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,720
You win.

882
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,680
And I think, you are a little
more handsome than him.

883
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,560
Do you agree with me?

884
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,400
Secretary Li is the most handsome
in the military region.

885
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,740
- Yes, he is the most handsome.
- That's right.

886
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,640
You win again.

887
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,200
About your status,

888
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,200
Comrade Ye Guohua is an ordinary soldier,

889
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,520
so the result is obvious.

890
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,800
But apart from
these external conditions,

891
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,080
as a soldier,

892
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,570
you are nothing compared to him.
