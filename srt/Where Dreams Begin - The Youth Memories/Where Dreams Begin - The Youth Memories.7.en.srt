00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,820
Report, sir.

4
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,820
The Battle Command Room is ready.

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,660
Good.

6
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,300
Magnifier.

7
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,500
Has the time of
the general offensive been fixed?

8
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,660
It was fixed at the last meeting.

9
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,340
2 a.m. on the 24th.

10
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,540
(23rd Wednesday)

11
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,140
Let's proofread the time.

12
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,060
It's time now. Attack them fiercely!

13
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,100
- Yes!
- Yes!

14
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
Hongling, thanks.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,100
What?

16
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,340
I said thanks.

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,420
For what?

18
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,740
Thanks for taking care of my dad.

19
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,180
And you have to wear

20
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,620
such an ill-fitting uniform.

21
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,940
I must wear this

22
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,340
or I'll violate military discipline.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Commander will reproach me.

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,820
The bottom line is,

25
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,220
I don't look like a talented student
from the Communication Training Squad

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,900
of the 115th Division
without wearing this.

27
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,380
Right?

28
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,940
Do you think I look good in this?

29
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,300
Then why don't you compliment me?

30
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,220
You look good.

31
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
You look good in any clothes.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,660
Only...

33
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,220
Only what?

34
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,700
Only that you don't look like a soldier.

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,220
What should I do?

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,420
Come. Let me adjust it for you.

37
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,180
It looks better now.

38
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,420
Raise your head.

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,100
Raise your head.

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,580
Sir.

41
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,220
Sir.

42
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,180
What about lunch?

43
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,460
Sir.

44
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,220
What would you like?

45
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,780
What did the villagers send us recently?

46
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,220
Braised pork.

47
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,140
Pork?

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,300
That's what the folks save
for the Spring Festival.

49
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
How could we accept that?

50
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,300
Yes.

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,740
We've returned the pork.

52
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,180
The villagers also sent us
dried sweet potatoes.

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
We accepted that.

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
Dried sweet potatoes aren't rare.

55
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,780
We can accept them.

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,740
I'm a bit hungry.

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,780
We don't have dried sweet potatoes.

58
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,980
Guohua, shall we play basketball?

59
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,060
Again?

60
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,500
We did it last night.

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,460
Tonight is different.

62
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,220
What's the difference?

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,860
The cheerleaders

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,660
are different every night.

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah.

66
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,420
Unbelievable.

67
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,580
You guys play tonight.

68
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,540
I'm not going.

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,660
No. You must come.

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,460
You rank first in the target practice
every day.

71
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
The cheerleaders come to see you.

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,980
If you don't come,

73
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,460
how can we see them?

74
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,140
Exactly.

75
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,500
Guohua is good at shooting.

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,220
Sure.

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,100
You've never seen someone
who is really good at shooting.

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Is there someone better than you?

79
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,820
Someone you don't know.

80
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,060
You guys go play tonight.

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,940
I'll take a break today.

82
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,300
I have to go back and make a phone call.

83
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,620
Dude, do you have a lover in Beijing?

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,220
Is she Mr. Tong's daughter?

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,780
Nonsense. It's not true.

86
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,620
Who is it, then?

87
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,620
Is she pretty?

88
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,260
You must keep an eye on her.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,340
Any progress with the art troupe thing

90
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,260
Guohua told you about last time?

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,780
He was just saying.

92
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,180
Don't take it seriously.

93
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,180
Guohua must be concerned about

94
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,860
anything related to you.

95
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,780
Still, it's useless.

96
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
You know our background.

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,620
I hear that

98
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
you've moved into Chunsheng's place.

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,180
Hongling,

100
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,740
don't forget what Mom told you before.

101
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,220
You're a girl.

102
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,740
If you take the wrong path
in terms of marriage and love,

103
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,340
your life will be ruined.

104
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,420
You should stay with

105
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,100
your aunt recently.

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,340
Did you forget that she hasn't

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,660
been in touch with us since Dad's death?

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
(Unit One)

109
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,620
Not bad.

110
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,260
He's been better.

111
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,140
Stable blood pressure.

112
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Stable moods.

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,220
Keep up the good work.

114
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,700
Thanks, Xiaomei.

115
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
You did most of the work.

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
What about your political appraisal?

117
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,780
Mr. Ye said

118
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,140
I would hear of the result in no time.

119
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,980
I should congratulate you beforehand
on joining the military this year.

120
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,580
Ye Fang told me.

121
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,700
Where is Hongling?

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,180
(High-end wooden violin box
Price: ¥15.6)

123
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,180
I heard that she is talented.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,900
She's good at playing the violin.

125
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,380
Xiaomei.

126
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,980
Hongling, would you
play a tune for me someday?

127
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,260
OK.

128
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,860
Chunsheng. He Hongling.
You're wanted on the phone.

129
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,180
Chunsheng, this is Guohua.

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,900
How is your dad?

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,860
Don't worry.

132
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
He is fine.

133
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,580
Focus on your training.

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,660
Don't worry about anything else.

135
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,460
Well...

136
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,340
Is Hongling with you?

137
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Put her on the phone.

138
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,300
Hongling, right?

139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,540
She's here with me.

140
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,300
OK. I'll put her on the phone.

141
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,380
Guohua wants to speak to you.

142
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Hello, Guohua.

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,740
Hongling.

144
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,140
I have good news for you.

145
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
What news?

146
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,260
The art troupe of the military region

147
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,100
is badly in need of a young
and highly skilled violinist.

148
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,380
I plan to recommend you.

149
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,740
I'm afraid I'm not qualified.

150
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,660
Yeah. It's impossible
under normal conditions.

151
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,300
But I heard that the former soloist

152
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,420
was accidentally injured.

153
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,700
She probably has to
leave the stage for good.

154
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,100
She used to be the pillar.

155
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,140
Without her, all performances
can't be staged.

156
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,700
None of the other members
can replace her.

157
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,180
They tried to recruit someone
to fill her void,

158
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,340
but they haven't found one yet.

159
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,460
This has been delayed for six months.

160
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,300
The leaders in charge of propaganda
in the military region are anxious.

161
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,580
They complained about
the bureaucratic rules

162
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,740
affecting their normal work.

163
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,460
So they decided to handle
special cases with special methods.

164
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,060
They'll examine
the candidates' skill first,

165
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
then other things.

166
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,380
Do you know what this means?

167
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,420
No.

168
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,540
It means they've loosened up
the requirements.

169
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,380
Hongling, I figure

170
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,300
as long as you can pass the test,

171
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,300
you have a good chance.

172
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,740
I see.

173
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,340
Hongling, wait for my news.

174
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,820
I'll call you if there's any emergency.

175
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
I'll let Mr. Niu get you.

176
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,940
Gotta go.

177
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,940
It's good news.

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,340
(Be vigilant to defend our country)

179
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,460
Hasn't he slept yet?

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,220
It's been two days.

181
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,380
What should we do?

182
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
He wouldn't take sleeping pills.

183
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,300
I have an idea.

184
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,980
What?

185
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,740
But I don't know if it's helpful.

186
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,060
No worries. Just tell me.

187
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,220
You told me the other day that

188
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,540
your dad talked with you
about the war times

189
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,540
and the best sleep he ever had.

190
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,540
What did he do?

191
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,540
(Be united for greater victories)

192
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,980
Hongling, how is it going?

193
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,860
Is everything ready?

194
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,620
Of course.

195
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,060
What about the quilt and pillow?

196
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,060
Right here.

197
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,140
OK.

198
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,220
Wait for me.

199
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,260
Report, sir!

200
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,300
Emergency!

201
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,900
Chunsheng.

202
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,140
(Unit One)

203
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,940
He Hongling.

204
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,300
You're wanted on the phone!

205
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Chunsheng, He Hongling!

206
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,620
Hello.

207
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,140
Guohua, they are out.

208
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,140
OK.

209
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
Thanks, Mr. Niu.

210
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,660
I'll bring you

211
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,980
two bottles of good wine
when I return to Beijing.

212
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,020
Why are you laughing?

213
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,220
It's fun.

214
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,580
Hongling, you must be tired.

215
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm sorry for bothering you these days.

216
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,580
You even didn't get a good sleep.

217
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm not tired.

218
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,460
I am glad to
look after Mr. Xiao with you.

219
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,900
I like him.

220
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,860
My dad died when I was young.

221
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,140
I feel like
I have a dad again these days.

222
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,860
Hongling, if you don't mind,

223
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,980

A little.

229
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,420
We only brought one blanket.

Sir, morning!

254
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,380
Did you sleep well last night?

255
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,140
Sir?

256
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
What are you playing at?

257
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,540
Where am I?

258
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,900
What's this place?

259
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,060
We are near Jinzhou.

260
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,260
The village at the foot
of the mountain is Hujiatun.

261
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,020
The command center
has been set up here temporarily.

262
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,700
We transferred here urgently last night.

263
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
Don't fool me.

264
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,340
It's Beijing at the foot of the mountain.

265
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,580
Why do you lie to me?

266
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,780
Who is she?

267
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,420
She...

268
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,460
Sir,

269
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,420
don't you remember me?

270
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm He Hongling, the telephone operator
and telegram decoder

271
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,060
from the original Communication
Training Squad of the 115th Division.

272
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,220
How old are you?

273
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,860
19.

274
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,540
If you're from the
Communication Training Squad,

275
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,180
you should be 50 at least.

276
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,260
What are you playing at?

277
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,620
Are you acting?

278
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,580
Dad.

279
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,580
You're back.

280
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,260
I'm back?

281
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,700
Where have I been?

282
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,820
Right. I'm supposed to be under

283
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,780
quarantine review in Yanqing.

284
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,500
Don't try to fool me.

285
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,700
I've been making mistakes all my life,

286
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,540
but I never get confused.

287
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,180
Dad, don't deny it.

288
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,420
We still have a command post at home.

289
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Xiaoliu, Xiangdong, and I

290
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
spent half a day

291
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,260
borrowing three truckloads of props

292
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,420
from the August First Film Studio.

293
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,980
Impossible.

294
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
You're slandering me.

295
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,940
You even dressed me up like this.

296
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,060
And the two of you.

297
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,340
How dare you run around

298
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
in military uniform?

299
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,140
We followed your orders.

300
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,300
Absolutely not.

301
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,700
Fine.

302
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,580
Don't be stubborn.

303
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,740
You'll know when we get home.

304
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,700
Chunsheng.

305
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,100
Don't argue with Mr. Xiao.

306
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
He's in poor health.

307
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,100
Who told you so?

308
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,020
Alright.

309
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,460
You're in good health.

310
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,780
Come.

311
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,340
Take care.

312
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,340
Come.

313
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,700
Dad.

314
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,140
What do you think?

315
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,780
I didn't lie, did I?

316
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,460
You just don't admit it.

317
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,820
You didn't let us sleep well for days.

318
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,700
If you don't believe me,

319
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,900
ask Hongling.

320
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,780
Stop talking.

321
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,740
Dad.

322
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,940
Dad, what's wrong?

323
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Don't be mad, OK?

324
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
I was joking with you.

325
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,460
Chunsheng,

326
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,580
it turns out that you told the truth.

327
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
Dad is getting senile

328
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,180
and confused.

329
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,140
I thought I could still
make contributions

330
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,780
to the Party and People's Army
for a few years

331
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,900
when the problem was clarified.

332
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,780
But it's over now.

333
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,620
I've become a burden.

334
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,540
Dad, don't say that.

335
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,180
You're still young.

336
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,140
You're not old at all.

337
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
You're in good health.

338
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,740
Moreover,

339
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,780
everyone could have minor illness.

340
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,740
Take good care of yourself.

341
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,060
When the problem is clarified,

342
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,620
the Party still has
a lot of tasks to assign you.

343
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,780
Chunsheng,

344
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,940
Hongling.

345
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,380
Did you take me up the mountain

346
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,620
on a motorcycle

347
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,260
just to make me sleep?

348
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,300
Sorry to trouble you.

349
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,580
It's no trouble, Mr. Xiao.

350
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,300
It's fun.

351
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,620
Go have a rest.

352
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
You've run around for a whole night.

353
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,780
You must be sleepy.

354
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,580
Dad, it's OK.

355
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,700
Let us stay with you.

356
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,420
I want to be alone for a while.

357
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,340
Mr. Niu, this is Guohua.

358
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,540
They are out again?

359
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,220
OK. Thank you.

360
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,020
Chunsheng, Hongling.

361
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,940
Guohua asked you to call him back.

362
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,700
Thanks, Mr. Niu.

363
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,820
Call him.

364
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,980
OK.

365
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,780
You're both fine, right?

366
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,260
I'm still inquiring about it.

367
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,420
(Ye Guohua felt like he was)

368
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,180
(retreating from
this triangular relationship.)

369
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,580
(He called more frequently,)

370
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,660
(only to find that he drifted)

371
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,060
(further apart from the other two.)

372
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,580
(Algebra)

373
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,260
(Hongjun, go for it!)

374
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,300
I already knew.

375
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,220
Your mom and I are pleased

376
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,140
with your good performance
in this training session.

377
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,620
Little rascal,

378
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,820
you didn't disgrace
your mom and me this time.

379
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,660
Alright.

380
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,820
You've been training hard these days.

381
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Stay home and have a good dinner.

382
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,620
Your mom has prepared your favorite...

383
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,140
Dad,

384
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,260
I'm going to see Chunsheng.

385
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,900
I won't eat at home.

386
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,980
You've just arrived.

387
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,820
Why are you so anxious to see him?

388
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,420
Chunsheng.

389
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,420
Chunsheng.

390
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,380
Guohua, you're back.

391
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,420
Hongling.

392
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,940
Sit down.

393
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,980
Let me get you some water.

394
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,220
Don't bother. I can do it myself.

395
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,860
It's OK. Sit down.

396
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,300
Thanks.

397
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,620
Wait a minute.

398
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,180
I don't know

399
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,740
you like dried sweet potatoes.

400
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,220
It's not for me.

401
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,460
It's for Commander.

402
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,740
Commander?

403
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,060
Mr. Xiao.

404
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
We're used to calling him Commander.

405
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,740
Mr. Xiao

406
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,780
gets sober and confused
by turns recently.

407
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,620
Not long ago,

408
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,500
he seemed to have
returned to the war times

409
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,780
and clamored to eat the dried
sweet potatoes sent by the villagers.

410
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,580
He's like a child.

411
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,020
We can only coax him.

412
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,420
How's your training?

413
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,260
Is everything OK?

414
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Yeah, it's OK.

415
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,580
Is it like in the military?

416
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,620
Almost.

417
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,620
Hongling, I asked you

418
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,740
to join me in the military before.

419
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,180
Would you like it?

420
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,140
Of course.

421
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,340
Then, I...

422
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,660
I want to go with you.

423
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,780
Guohua, you're back.

424
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,780
Chunsheng.

425
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,980
How do you like it in Beidaihe?

426
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,740
It's good.

427
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,020
Come on. Sit.

428
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,700
Don't stand there.

429
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,260
Hongling, let me do it.

430
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,660
You take a break.

431
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,500
It's OK.

432
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,180
It's OK.

433
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,180
It's OK. Let me do it.

434
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,860
Guohua.

435
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,180
Guohua, sit down.

436
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,620
I invited you over today

437
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,580
to have a good talk with you.

438
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,900
I'll retire
when your wedding date is set.

439
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,580
I want to babysit my grandchildren.

440
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,420
Mom.

441
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,900
I hear that you've been preparing for
the college entrance examination.

442
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,220
But the examination
was abolished in 1966.

443
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
It will be resumed.

444
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
Probably soon.

445
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,820
Where did you hear it from?

446
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,460
From Beijing?

447
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,620
My speculation.

448
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,140
Your guess?

449
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,260
Kind of.

450
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,780
It's a good thing that
young people love studying.

451
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,860
You're better than Tao

452
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,860
in this aspect.

453
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,700
Let me put it this way, Ye Fang.

454
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,260
Your mom and I

455
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,140
have arranged

456
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,540
a good future for both of you.

457
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,940
You just work hand in hand

458
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,460
and take one step at a time.

459
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,900
Don't make blind conjectures.

460
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,060
Your future will be bright.

461
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,700
Mom, eat. The food is getting cold.

462
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,140
OK. Eat.

463
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,820
(Carry forward revolutionary tradition
Strive for greater glory)

464
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,940
Fang,

465
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,700
the longan from my mom!

466
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,500
Report.

467
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,460
Come in.

468
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,620
Ma'am,

469
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
do you want to see me?

470
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,620
Ye Fang.

471
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,020
Come here. Sit down.

472
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
Let me get you some water.

473
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
Ye Fang,

474
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,180
the Party Organization is concerned
about your work

475
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,740
as well as your personal affairs.

476
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,620
Here. Have some water.

477
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Personal affairs?

478
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,260
Your love relationship and marriage.

479
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Comrade Ye,

480
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,420
you and Chen Tao

481
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,900
are both from revolutionary families.

482
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,420
You're loyal and trustworthy.

483
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,100
Moreover,

484
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,900
you stand out in work.

485
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,180
So,

486
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,300
considering your situation,

487
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,380
the Party Organization
suggests you get married.

488
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,980
It's good for your work.

489
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,540
Ma'am, I don't want to
get married too early.

490
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,220
The time is precious
for working and studying.

491
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,900
Comrade Ye,

492
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,220
the Organization highly

493
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,660
recognizes your selfless dedication.

494
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,780
But there is no conflict.

495
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,140
I've been there.

496
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,260
I know a good family relationship

497
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,660
will assist in your study and work

498
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,420
rather than affect them.

499
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,140
Ma'am...

500
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,140
So,

501
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,020
here is my advice.

502
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
There's no rush.

503
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,500
This year,

504
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,340
let's give you a big wedding.

505
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,060
When you get back,

506
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,660
consider the opinions
of your parents and the leaders.

507
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello, who's that?

508
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,060
Are you a family member of Chen Hongjun?

509
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,460
Yes.

510
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,820
This is Baoding Public Security Bureau.

511
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,100
Public Security Bureau?

512
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,500
What did Chen Hongjun do?

513
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
He is suspected of
indecently assaulting a woman.

514
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,700
He is in custody.

515
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,900
We have to notify his family

516
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,180
and he gave us your number and name.

517
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
What did you just say?

518
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,940
(Severity to those who resist)

519
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,740
Get in.

520
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,340
How dare he assault a soldier?

521
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
Outrageously bold.

522
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,860
He has a death wish.

523
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,060
Go.

524
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,060
Ye Fang.

525
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,300
It's all your fault.

526
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,060
No.

527
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
How could it be possible?

528
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,140
Are you still denying it?

529
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,300
Do you think Ye Fang
falsely accused him?

530
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
Mom, that's not what I mean.

531
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,700
I mean, Chen Hongjun...

532
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,220
I'm going to kill him!

533
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,020
What?

534
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,420
Do you want to be a murderer?

535
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
You've spoiled him.

536
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,900
Why is it my fault?

537
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,980
Mom.

538
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,020
I'm sorry.

539
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,940
What should we do?

540
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,540
She is so young
and isn't married yet.

541
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,580
It must be from the Chen family.

542
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,940
I'll get it.

543
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Let me answer it.

544
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,300
Hello.

545
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,060
They pretended to comfort us.

546
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,740
In fact,

547
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,740
they want to renounce the engagement.

548
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,620
They wouldn't even wait until tomorrow.

549
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,900
Mrs. Liu.

550
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,660
Chunsheng.

551
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,740
Hongjun...

552
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,580
He raped Ye Fang

553
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,460
and was caught by the police.

554
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,020
Mrs. Liu.

555
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,060
Mrs. Liu. Mrs. Liu.

556
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,780
Don't worry.
Speak calmly when you get there.

557
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,860
It's no good to be impatient.

558
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,620
I know. Stop rambling.

559
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Your cap.

560
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,060
Don't you need me to go?

561
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
No, no.

562
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,380
You two stay at home.

563
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,620
If anyone asks about me,

564
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,980
tell them I have an emergency
in my hometown.

565
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,740
Try your best to hold it down.

566
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,420
- Let Guohua...
- Tomorrow noon,

567
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
tell Li

568
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,620
to cook Ye Fang's favorite dishes.

569
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
You go tell his mom.

570
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,020
She has to know this.

571
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,300
Take care.

572
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,340
I know.

573
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,620
You...

574
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,180
Here, Mrs. Liu, take the medicine.

575
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,780
Here.

576
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,940
Director Wu.

577
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,620
Director Wu.

578
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,820
It's my fault as a leader not to have

579
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,340
stopped such an incident from happening.

580
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,260
I must make a self-criticism
to the Party Organization

581
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,860
as well as Deputy Commander Ye and you.

582
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,380
But don't worry.

583
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,180
The police have clarified that

584
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,580
they'll pay great attention to the incident

585
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
and deal with it

586
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,740
severely and rapidly by law.

587
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,300
Don't rush to any self-criticism.

588
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,700
It hasn't been
thoroughly investigated yet.

589
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,860
We can't determine its nature.

590
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,300
Of course.

591
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,180
We can't determine its nature

592
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,940
without investigation

593
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,540
Where is Ye Fang?

594
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,620
Salute.

595
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,420
Ma'am.

596
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
She's in the room.

597
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,060
Leave us alone.

598
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,140
Mom.

599
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,580
Mom is here.

600
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,260
Has Chen Tao renounced the engagement?

601
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,220
Did you do it on purpose?

602
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,620
How could I have such a daughter?

603
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,700
Do you know how big your mistake is

604
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,460
and how bad the influence is?

605
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,580
You are a girl.

606
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,820
How could you

607
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,020
ruin your own reputation?

608
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,820
You

609
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,740
must make a profound self-criticism

610
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,380
to the Organization, Mrs. Xue,
and all the leaders

611
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,460
who are concerned about you.

612
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,860
You must accept any punishment
from the Organization against you.

613
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,340
Mrs. Xue,

614
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,860
I was wrong.

615
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,900
Is that all?

616
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,940
Director Wu, don't be angry.

617
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,700
To put it plainly,

618
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,300
they are young.

619
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
The biggest mistake

620
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,580
young people are prone to make

621
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,980
is about love.

622
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,460
It happens.

623
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,580
You mustn't be indulgent towards her.

624
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,340
You must severely punish her.

625
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,580
I see.

626
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,220
Don't worry. I know what to do.

627
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,460
As for the Public Security Bureau,

628
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,220
please explain it and

629
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,380
make a sincere apology to them for me.

630
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,060
I'll call the police chief now

631
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
and ask him to release the young man.

632
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,060
Before that...

633
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,460
What's his name?

634
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,020
Chen Hongjun.

635
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,820
I want to see Chen Hongjun.

636
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,900
Please give us some privacy.

637
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,820
Leave us alone.

638
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,780
Yes.

639
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm Ye Fang's mother.

640
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,020
Ye Fang told me what happened.

641
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,060
Do you know the consequence?

642
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
I know.

643
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,660
What is it?

644
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,500
I may die.

645
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,700
You'll definitely die.

646
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,940
Or maybe

647
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,980
there's another consequence.

648
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,500
I'll marry Ye Fang to you

649
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
and let her apply for demobilization
ahead of schedule.

650
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,860
She agreed.

651
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,900
You and Ye Fang

652
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,220
were romantically involved

653
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,900
even before she was enlisted.

654
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,500
But you kept it from your parents.

655
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,500
Afterward,

656
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,740
we introduced
Commissar Chen's son to Ye Fang

657
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,620
and they started to date.

658
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,860
But you and Ye Fang
couldn't forget each other.

659
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,620
So you didn't break up.

660
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,140
Lately, Ye Fang
was going to marry Chen Tao.

661
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,860
You had a fight.

662
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,780
You hit her on the spur of the moment.

663
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,140
She called the police in a fury

664
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,580
and said you raped her.

665
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,300
Do you understand?

666
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,460
Yes, I understand.

667
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
This whole thing has been clarified.

668
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
If you cooperate,

669
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,700
you can get out today.

670
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,660
Then, you get engaged to Ye Fang
without delay.

671
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,900
Do you get it?

672
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,380
Yes.

673
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,340
But,

674
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,340
I have two requirements.

675
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,500
First,

676
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,460
be good to Ye Fang.

677
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,460
I will.

678
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,100
Be good to her for a lifetime.

679
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,900
I promise I will.

680
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,900
I will.

681
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,780
Second,

682
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,820
from now on,

683
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,660
you are one of the Ye family.

684
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,020
Do you agree?

685
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,620
Come with me.

686
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,580
Let's talk privately.

687
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,580
Guohua.

688
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,620
None of your business!

689
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,060
I'll go check.

690
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,900
Stand still.

691
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,900
Do you have anything else to say?

692
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,940
You don't, right?

693
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,340
Fine.

694
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,260
Wait.

695
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,740
Come on.

696
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,540
No.

697
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,060
Stop it.

698
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
Guohua, what are you doing?

699
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it.

700
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,340
Chunsheng, leave me alone.

701
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:38,740
Let go of me.

702
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,340
Stop it!

703
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,100
Are you OK?

704
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,260
Ye Fang!

705
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,380
What are you doing?

706
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,140
Why do you still protect him
after he raped you?

707
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,500
That's what he told you?

708
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,740
Would the police arrest him
if he didn't assault you?

709
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,500
Enough, stop it!

710
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,020
Fang, come with me.
I have questions to ask you.

711
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,300
Stop fighting.

712
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,300
Wait for me.

713
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,260
Do you hear me?

714
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,900
Fang,

715
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,660
Hongjun grew up with me.

716
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,540
I know well what kind of person he is.

717
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,540
And he likes you so much.

718
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,420
He would never do anything

719
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,620
that may hurt you.

720
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,660
Say something.

721
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,420
That day,

722
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,780
I went to the old house to see Hongjun.

723
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,060
When I was changing his
bed sheets and covers,

724
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,020
I didn't know what went wrong with him.

725
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,700
He held me in his arms suddenly

726
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,020
and kissed me.

727
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,140
I was so scared.

728
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,820
I pushed him away and ran out.

729
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,260
But at the same time, you realized that

730
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,380
it was an opportunity for you
to get rid of the Chen family.

731
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,740
So you told the police
that Chen Hongjun raped you.

732
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,460
Yes. Scold me if you want.

733
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,940
After all,

734
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,940
I should be held accountable.

735
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,660
I used Chen Hongjun's feelings for me

736
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,180
to get rid of the Chen family.

737
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,740
Fang, you're so bold.

738
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,540
Have you ever thought that

739
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,820
if it didn't develop

740
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,060
as you designed,

741
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,260
Chen Hongjun would be screwed?

742
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,540
I thought it over.

743
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,900
I knew

744
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,780
my mom wouldn't escalate it.

745
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,980
She would find a way to hold it down.

746
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,540
After all,

747
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,060
domestic shame shouldn't be made public.

748
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,140
My family, particularly,

749
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,620
won't tolerate such a scandal.

750
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,180
What if your mom didn't act
as you imagined

751
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,060
and must hold Chen Hongjun accountable?

752
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,260
If they disregarded their reputation

753
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,700
and must have him sentenced,

754
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,820
I would turn myself in.

755
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,900
You...

756
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,500
I would tell the police

757
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,420
I falsely accused him.

758
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,700
Anyway, I would confess everything.

759
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,100
I would never hurt him.

760
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,500
Fang, you...

761
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,380
Fine. You're good.

762
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,220
Fang, let me ask you one last question.

763
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,460
Go ahead.

764
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,900
Do you love Chen Hongjun?

765
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,580
To be honest, Chunsheng,

766
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,460
I don't know if I love him.

767
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,420
But

768
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,860
I like his company.

769
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,300
With him, I feel at ease

770
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,140
and secure.

771
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,980
Ye Fang,

772
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,380
don't disappoint Chen Hongjun.

773
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,220
Mrs. Liu.

774
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:48,940
Please.

775
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,140
Have some snacks.

776
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,940
Ye Fang, get Mrs. Liu some water.

777
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,820
Here.

778
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,900
Guohua, give Hongjun some candies.

779
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
- Mrs. Liu, have some water.
- Please.

780
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,020
OK. Thanks.

781
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,540
This isn't a main course.

782
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,780
Put it on the side.

783
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,060
OK. Let me do it.

784
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,100
Give it to me.

785
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,140
Some dishes needn't be
served on big plates.

786
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,420
Use small plates.

787
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,700
We can serve more
when the food is finished.

788
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,900
Don't waste food.

789
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,820
Corruption and waste are great crimes.

790
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,180
Hongjun,

791
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,820
come out and have a word with me.

792
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,420
OK.

793
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,660
Thanks.

794
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,900
Mom, I'm going out with Chunsheng.

795
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,380
- I'll have a word with him, Mrs. Liu.
- Is there enough space?

796
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,140
Chunsheng.

797
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,140
Do you believe me?

798
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,020
Yes.

799
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,980
Hongjun,

800
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,340
today is the occasion
of your engagement.

801
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,260
Why don't you look happy?

802
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,180
Hongjun, I'm like your elder brother.

803
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,900
If you're not sure,

804
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,140
you shouldn't get engaged.

805
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,740
Chunsheng,

806
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,100
I like Ye Fang.
