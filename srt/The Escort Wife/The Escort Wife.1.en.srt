1
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,102
Oh, well...

2
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,519
Here we go again.

3
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,144
Another day
of making a living.

4
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:48,609
Because I'm not rich.

5
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:51,352
My husband is.

6
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,019
This work-from-home routine?

7
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:22,019
It's getting boring.

8
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,827
Oh, well.

9
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:27,102
I just got paid yesterday.

10
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,244
Here I am...

11
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,307
Same place.

12
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:32,707
Same spot.

13
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:34,352
And the same view.

14
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,518
Maybe I should find
a new adventure.

15
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,144
I wonder what.

16
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,698
So...

17
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,940
Are you coming home late?

18
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,307
Can I go out by myself?

19
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,453
So, what now?

20
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,385
Should I order food for us?

21
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:12,852
Okay.

22
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:13,948
Yeah.

23
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:16,174
I love you.

24
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,102
Patricia?

25
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:27,019
Oh, shit.

26
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,202
Are you okay?

27
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,264
Fuck.

28
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:31,721
Wait!

29
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,227
What happened?

30
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:49,023
Why did you lock the door?

31
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,889
Nothing...

32
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,795
I just fell asleep.

33
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,516
I was so worried!

34
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,635
I'm sorry...

35
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,327
I need to go back
to the hospital.

36
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,352
I promise...

37
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,377
We can have

38
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,617
breakfast together tomorrow.

39
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,977
Hey, I'm sorry
about what happened.

40
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,477
It's okay.

41
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:33,752
It's my fault.

42
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:43,968
Gotta go. Bye.

43
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,477
I love you.

44
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,883
I love you.

45
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:57,977
Take a shower.

46
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,102
Sweetheart?

47
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,877
- What?
- Can I go back to work?

48
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,953
It's different when
you're in the office.

49
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,977
It's been a while.

50
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:37,169
You know?

51
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,444
I'm just here at home.

52
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:41,193
I'm so bored and...

53
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:44,483
I'm healthy enough to work.

54
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,094
Please?

55
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,904
Doctor's order sweetheart.

56
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,570
You're too fragile.

57
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,506
You can't risk it.

58
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,865
- He just said two...
- No. He said three to four.

59
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,827
But, that's a very long time.

60
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,006
I'm so bored here already.

61
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,882
Why don't you invite
your friends to come over?

62
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,263
Look, I just have one friend.

63
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:11,888
Joanne.

64
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,778
She's not here.

65
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,727
Oh yeah?
Where'd she go?

66
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:17,505
Out of the country.

67
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:25,602
I'm going to sleep.

68
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,352
I'll just eat later.

69
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
Fuck.

70
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:09,727
You startled me.

71
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,227
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,334
Sorry too...

73
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,144
Hey...

74
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,602
What time
are you coming home?

75
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,352
I can't really
talk right now.

76
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,477
I really miss you.

77
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,852
Should I wait for you?

78
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,726
No.

79
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,227
I'm on night shift.

80
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,102
Sorry.

81
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,977
I didn't know.

82
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,477
Should we have
breakfast together?

83
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,227
Maybe.

84
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:41,602
Hey, I gotta go.

85
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:43,227
I love you...

86
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,227
Hey!

87
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,133
What's that?

88
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,288
What?

89
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:14,852
What?

90
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:16,788
That.

91
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,914
That!

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,276
Wait...

93
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,229
I need to take a shower.

94
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,852
Is that my tank top?

95
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:52,664
Hey, are you alright?

96
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,444
I wanna take you
out to lunch.

97
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:00,120
What?

98
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:02,477
Let's go out.

99
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,197
Let's eat out.

100
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:13,229
This is still
my favorite place.

101
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,269
Thank you.

102
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,120
Right?!

103
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,557
Yeah. You know,
we used to come here a lot.

104
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,752
Is it our
anniversary today?

105
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:24,477
Just celebrating.

106
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,602
Celebrating what?

107
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:31,573
Say 'hello' to the new head of
the orthopedic surgery department.

108
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:35,102
Oh my God! I'm so
proud of you! Congrats!

109
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:36,602
Thank you.

110
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:39,436
Here it is.

111
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,202
I'll have the...

112
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,745
- bone-in ribeye...
- Okay.

113
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:57,852
Herb-glazed carrots

114
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,549
And broccoli salad, please.

115
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,319
What?

116
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,612
We practically
ordered the same thing.

117
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,477
Thank you Ma'am.

118
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:23,538
You looked like you
just stripteased for that waiter.

119
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,328
What the fuck?

120
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:28,354
Sorry.

121
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,456
I didn't realize.

122
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:36,102
Can we have coffee, please?

123
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:36,952
Sure, sir.

124
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,706
I wish we can have beer.

125
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,065
Sure, ma'am.
We have beer.

126
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,581
No.

127
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,456
I have work tonight.

128
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:46,745
- Alright.
- Okay, sir. Thank you.

129
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,406
Do you know her?

130
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,617
No.

131
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,039
Do you?

132
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:20,269
Sweetheart...

133
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:21,169
Hi.

134
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,823
- Wait...
- Stay here please.

135
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:26,952
I...

136
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:28,894
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

137
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,041
Stay here please.

138
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,151
Stay, please?

139
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:50,221
Stop. Stop.

140
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,120
Stop, please.

141
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,144
Hey, come here.

142
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,299
I really have to go.

143
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,852
Alright? I have to go.

144
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:04,436
I'm sorry...

145
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:15,065
Girl...

146
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,977
I can't go back to work yet.

147
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,174
It's very complicated.

148
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,834
You have no idea.

149
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,960
I can understand why Roy
is so concerned...

150
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:28,922
But, it doesn't mean you
can't go out by yourself.

151
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:30,862
When are you
coming back?

152
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,327
In five months.

153
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,883
Five months? Shit.
That's still a long time.

154
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,416
Yes, shit.

155
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,508
I have nothing
to do here.

156
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,658
And, girl...

157
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,690
I haven't scored yet.

158
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:46,401
I haven't had
one good fuck yet.

159
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:49,477
What are you talking about?
You're not the only one.

160
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:50,502
I haven't had one too.

161
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:51,977
What?

162
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,320
Girl...

163
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:56,331
Go out.
Have a drink or two.

164
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,018
And a fuck or two?

165
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,452
Hi. Miss Patricia!

166
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:09,352
You haven't been
back in a while.

167
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,227
The other time,
we just had lunch.

168
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:12,503
Where's Doc cutie?

169
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,163
Work.

170
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:17,174
I just wanted to
chill for a bit.

171
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,324
Beer.

172
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:40,102
Miss Patricia, do you
need anything else?

173
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,096
Nah.

174
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:44,135
Just the check babe.

175
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,711

00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:26,352
It doesn't suit you to be
sexually aggressive.

196
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,648
This is for you.

197
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:33,923
For the entire month.

198
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:18,820
Paid like a whore.

199
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:24,781
Why can't you be more
at home sometimes?

200
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:30,352
This is just a
three-day seminar.

201
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:33,727
Work.

202
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,104
It's been a long time
since I've been out.

203
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:48,602
Three days...

204
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,132
You're always away.

205
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,406
I'm all alone here.

206
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,007
Because you need to rest
so we can have a baby?

207
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:00,602
Fuck.

208
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,234
I just...

209
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:04,789
What?!

210
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,507
Fucked me?

211
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:16,227
Even if I fuck you
every night...

212
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,752
I will still not
have a baby with you.

213
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:24,727
Fuck!

214
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:32,838
Okay.

215
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:41,852
You know what?

216
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:46,269
You better
make your boys swim well

217
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,044
so we can have a baby.

218
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,102
Or maybe your dick
is just firing blanks.

219
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,727
Fuck you!

220
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:03,894
Fuck you!

221
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:14,227
I'm sorry.

222
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:18,227
I'm sorry.

223
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,019
Shit!

224
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,102
I'm sorry.

225
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,859
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

226
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,688
I'm sorry.

227
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:43,977
Fuck.

228
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,679
I'm sorry.

229
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,769
Sorry.

230
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:07,305
Who's this jerk
this time?

231
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:15,452
You two-timing asshole.

232
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,594
I thought I'm your crush?

233
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,602
Cheers to you too!

234
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:46,227
Hi, it's Patricia.

235
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:50,977
I wanted to schedule an
appointment for hair treatment...

236
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,602
You look so pretty.

237
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,077
Just trying
something new.

238
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:19,102
The usual?

239
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:28,453
Hi.

240
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:31,352
I'm Chrissy.

241
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:32,977
Patricia.

242
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,519
I like it here.

243
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:37,227
Cool...

244
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,477
relaxed

245
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,852
Not hectic.

246
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:43,102
Opposite from everyday
pressure from school.

247
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:44,852
Oh...

248
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:47,352
- You study in the city college?
- Yeah.

249
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,227
Drinks?

250
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,102
Junior.

251
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,602
Data science and
software development.

252
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:54,602
Same beer.

253
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,352
Sorry, ID?

254
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:58,880
Wow, that's...

255
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:00,727
That's just...

256
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:02,669
Wow.

257
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,227
Hey, this one's mine.

258
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:39,133
Thank you.

259
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,852
Spend your money for school.

260
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:08,984
- Hi.
- Hey.

261
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:21,273
Hey, I like your
new hairstyle.

262
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,592
Really?

263
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:23,492
Thank you.

264
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,727
Is that a new trend?

265
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,070
You know, I've seen a few women
carry that hairstyle.

266
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:35,744
What's this?

267
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:36,977
Oh, wait. It's um...

268
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,096
Well...

269
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:39,852
What's that?

270
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,851
This is for...

271
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,477
You.

272
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:47,990
You may not think
it's funny...

273
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,890
But, I find this humerus.

274
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:52,984
Yeah!

275
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:54,531
Humerus?

276
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:57,977
Humor...

277
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,202

278
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:01,898
Humor-uuus.

279
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,867
Humor. Jokes. Humor.

280
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,102
Ah...

281
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,477
You're referring to...

282
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,227
Yeah, it's that bone.

283
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,102
Yeah!

284
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:14,117
- It's very funny. Yeah.
- It's funny.

285
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:55,562
Yeah?

286
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,477

I didn't expect you'd call.

296
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:51,769
Oh...

297
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:52,544
School?

298
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:54,952
Too many stuff to submit.

299
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:55,852
But...

300
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:58,727
I'm almost done.

301
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,102
I'll have one later.

302
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,519
I don't know. But...

303
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,865
I like beer better.

304
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,536
I'm having one right now.

305
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,852
Maybe I'll drink two.

306
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:14,727
Or maybe three.

307
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,977
You can come over
brings some beer

308
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:19,002
If you like.

309
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,536
Hey, um...

310
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,559
I'm gonna
take a shower first.

311
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,744
Me too.

312
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,341
I haven't taken
a shower yet.

313
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,724
Hey.

314
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:34,977
I'll go in
the shower now.

315
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:36,529
Bye.

316
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:39,352
Bye, Joanne.

317
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:41,644
See you soon, chief.

318
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:45,074
Bye, Chrissy.

319
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,686
What...

320
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,352
How?

321
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:10,769
Where is he?

322
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:11,769
Who?

323
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:13,420
My husband.

324
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,227
Roy?!

325
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,894
Is he hiding here?

326
00:33:19,352 --> 00:33:20,769
Roy!

327
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,727
He already left, Patricia.

328
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:24,852
Roy?!

329
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,171
Look...

330
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,102
I am not
your cliché wife.

331
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,178
I'm not here
to fight with you...

332
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,227
pull your hair...

333
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:38,627
Or be scandalous.

334
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,269
I just wanna know...

335
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:46,983
where the fuck
my husband is.

336
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,102
How long...

337
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:12,102
have you been
having an affair

338
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,731
with my husband?

339
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,484
We don't have an affair.

340
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,155
Fuck the both of you!

341
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:23,624
I've seen you many times
by my kitchen window.

342
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,687
You're fucking
different men.

343
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:32,305
And now, my husband.

344
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,639
Shit.

345
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:37,727
Shit, what?

346
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:39,296
I'm...

347
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:40,827
I'm not cheating.

348
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,920
So, Roy's cheating
on both of us?

349
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,803
Look...

350
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:51,352
Patricia...

351
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,055
Roy is just a client.

352
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:54,602
Just like that.

353
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:55,648
What?

354
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:56,920
So...

355
00:34:56,945 --> 00:35:00,233
Roy fucks
and pays you?

356
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,227
I'm really sorry.

357
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:15,102
Please don't tell my husband
that I was here....

358
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:16,757
and that I know.

359
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,852
And don't you ever

360
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:25,602
see him again.

361
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:52,138
Roy!

362
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:48,131
I'm leaving.

363
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,569
I'm transferring school.

364
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:52,265
I have some savings

365
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,915
more than enough
for my college

366
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,690
and for the
next ten years.

367
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,475
I wanna see
your bedroom.

368
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,046
Huh?

369
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,477
Can I ask you something?

370
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,727
How do all these work?

371
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,352
How are you
able to do this?

372
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,873
I get calls.

373
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:18,031
If the cash
or crypto is transferred,

374
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:20,681
then, we make a schedule.

375
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:22,975
One client a day only.

376
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,670
And strictly at 8:30 PM.

377
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,186
Also nothing...

378
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,577
after eleven because...

379
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:30,477
School.

380
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:31,534
What?

381
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:34,967
You don't like late night
and staying up late...

382
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:36,816
Because you have school.

383
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:38,977
Yes.

384
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:52,139
Did you know that Roy
is practically your neighbor?

385
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,690
No.

386
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:57,144
I know what they
do for work. But...

387
00:37:57,477 --> 00:37:59,061
I don't know where they live.

388
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,519
Wait.

389
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:04,061
I'll get something.

390
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,327
I have a client list.

391
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:13,413
It's handwritten. Here...

392
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,977
You're probably

393
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:24,077
a much better accountant

394
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,102
than me.

395
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,061
Please...

396
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:30,602
These?

397
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,804
These are their schedules?

398
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:35,102
Yes.

399
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:42,227
So many cheaters.

400
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,477
James!

401
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,352
What's up?

402
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,393
James.

403
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:03,144
Sure. Anytime dude. Yeah.

404
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:04,394
Yes, I'm free.

405
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:05,769
Come over.

406
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,477
Bring Charles.

407
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,499
What's that?

408
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:16,320
I'm hanging out
with the boys tonight.

409
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:17,859
I have. Yeah.

410
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:20,352
Yes, I have a lot.

411
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,477
Bring ice.

412
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:24,477
Sorry...

413
00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:27,102
Wear something nice.

414
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:38,702
- That's really funny, bro.
- Of course, I got it.

415
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:41,577
You know, bro?
I miss this place.

416
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:45,852
This place misses you too Charles.

417
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,803
That's my favorite.

418
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:52,894
Funny. It's funny.

419
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,374
That's the last guys.

420
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,977
Do you need
anything else?

421
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:03,102
Thank you, sweetheart.

422
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:06,977
Isn't she pretty?

423
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,256
Yeah bro.

424
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:11,769
Hundred percent.

425
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:13,773
I'll marry her in the future.

426
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,257
When you are dead.

427
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:16,420
Fuck you!

428
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:21,144
I love you so much, Patricia.

429
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:36,686
If only...

430
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:39,281
'If only,' what?

431
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,561
We can switch lives.

432
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:44,811
I used to
have fun you know.

433
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,186
But...

434
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:51,102
I think I need
a new adventure.

435
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,644
And leave
my husband...

436
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,019
As a revenge.

437
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:59,476
Make your own adventure.

438
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,144
Go out.

439
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,352
Where are you going?

440
00:41:07,477 --> 00:41:09,006
I'm done.

441
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,602
What's gonna happen
to your clients?

442
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,905
- You can have them.
- What?!

443
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:16,602
Take my clients.

444
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:19,519
Are you serious?

445
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:20,972
Maybe...

446
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,247
This will be
your new adventure.

447
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:25,894
It's not that bad.

448
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,019
Have you ever
fucked other men?

449
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:37,144
My clients
are well selected.

450
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:39,394
They don't
know each other.

451
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,049
Even if they may know
each other in real life.

452
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,102
All of them are rich,

453
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,477
married,

454
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,002
and have something to lose.

455
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:49,412
That's why I know
all their secrets.

456
00:41:49,437 --> 00:41:51,334
And I keep a record of it.

457
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:53,519
Isn't that...

458
00:41:53,623 --> 00:41:55,936
The same as blackmail?

459
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:59,477
Call it whatever you want.

460
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,990
I call it 'security.'

461
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:07,451
Leverage.

462
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,727
I don't do blackmail.

463
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,269
It's not good
for business.

464
00:42:21,602 --> 00:42:22,727
This is for you.

465
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:25,019
I'm not used to
wearing perfume.

466
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:31,144
You need it because...

467
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:33,352
that's me on your skin.

468
00:42:34,394 --> 00:42:35,519
And also...

469
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:42,232
keep a knife handy.

470
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,904
And make sure you know
all their moves.

471
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,144
Make them happy.

472
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,602
They will pay you well.

473
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:54,144
Do you want me...

474
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:56,128
to teach you?

475
00:42:56,864 --> 00:42:57,885
How?

476
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:30,451
Hey.

477
00:44:30,644 --> 00:44:31,644
Where've you been?

478
00:44:31,778 --> 00:44:33,461
Joanne's back.

479
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:34,977
I met with her.

480
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:37,269
Shouldn't you be
staying home?

481
00:44:42,008 --> 00:44:43,154
Did you drink?

482
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,811
Nah, I didn't drink.

483
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,477
You didn't cook
so I ordered out.

484
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,727
For myself.
Are you hungry?

485
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:51,311
I just ate.

486
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:06,019
Thank you Chrissy.

487
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,755
Miss Patricia,
this is the property.

488
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:14,644
Just let me know
what else you need.

489
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:17,086
I'll takeover the lease.

490
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,390
Chrissy has settled this.

491
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:23,068
It's all yours for the
next eight months.

492
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:24,461
All paid for.

493
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,352
Please sign here.

494
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,052
I'll keep your apartment, Chrissy.

495
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,727
And I will live your life.

496
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:50,658
These clients...

497
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:53,477
They are mine.

498
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,144
Assholes.

499
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:15,646
Asshole.

500
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:17,709
Jerk.

501
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:14,769
- Hello?
- Hello?!

502
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,776
What perfume?

503
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:21,227
You messaged me.
Sexy and perfume.

504
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:25,394
That was for Joanne.

505
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:27,577
We were just
messing around.

506
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:31,880
You know, because...
she's dating a new guy.

507
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:33,572
She was the one
I was texting with.

508
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:35,644
Good for her.

509
00:47:35,669 --> 00:47:39,482
Yes, good.
I'm so happy for her.

510
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:47,992
Fuck!

511
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:49,852
Leverage.

512
00:48:56,279 --> 00:49:00,852
I'm subbing for Chrissy
while she's away.

00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,456
Huh?

00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,727
I like your scent.

565
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,102
It's the new detergent.

566
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:35,737
Okay.

567
00:53:10,363 --> 00:53:11,640
Fuck.

Chrissy.

00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,406
Chrissy?

572
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,950
I'll see you.

573
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:41,750
Soon?

574
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,269
Hey, sweetheart.

575
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:11,352
Where've you been?

576
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,102
I ordered your steak
from the deli.

577
00:56:14,894 --> 00:56:16,144
Nice, thank you.

578
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:28,477
Shit!

579
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:24,852
This tastes good.

580
00:58:24,977 --> 00:58:26,477
But, it's the wrong cut.

581
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:31,352
You know that
I like T-bone.

582
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:34,977
This meat.
where'd you buy this?

583
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:38,602
I got this
from the supermarket.

584
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,602
The deli was closed.

585
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:47,352
Not bad.

586
00:58:48,977 --> 00:58:50,602
Not so good either.

587
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:14,164
Angel!

588
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:15,477
Angel!

589
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:19,577
Angel!

590
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:21,452
What's wrong with you?!

591
00:59:21,477 --> 00:59:22,852
Are you trying
to kill me?

592
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:23,977
Son of a bitch!

593
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:28,671
Patricia!

594
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:35,952
Can you get us

595
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:38,227
glasses and ice,
please sweetheart?

596
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:40,227
Let me help you.

597
00:59:41,096 --> 00:59:42,846
No. Dude. It's fine.

598
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:43,954
She can handle that.

599
00:59:44,477 --> 00:59:45,894
- Sure?
- Yeah.

600
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,477
So...

601
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:49,144
How's your day, bro?

602
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:52,269
Same as usual.

603
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:02,352
What the fuck is wrong with you man?

604
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,602
What were you saying?

605
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,602
What's wrong with you?

606
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,091
Hey. You alright?

607
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,093
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

608
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,844
Nothing is for free.

609
01:00:41,102 --> 01:00:42,977
- Sweetheart.
- Hey.

610
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:45,514
Hey, what happened to you?

611
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:47,608
- Nothing.
- You're drunk.

612
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,102
No.

613
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,062
Slowly.

614
01:00:53,953 --> 01:00:55,578
Oh, man.

615
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:16,679
Good for her.

616
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,977
Yes. I'm so happy for her.

617
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:25,852
This tastes good.
But, it's the wrong cut.

618
01:01:25,877 --> 01:01:26,977
Not bad.

619
01:01:27,148 --> 01:01:28,398
Not so good either.

620
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,352
I love you.

621
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:31,727
Take a shower.

622
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:34,227
You practically stripteased
for that waiter.

623
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:35,491
What the fuck?

624
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:39,070
It doesn't suit you to be
so sexually aggressive.

625
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:49,744
Fuck you.

626
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:51,602
Fuck you.

627
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:53,335
Fuck you.

628
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,203
I'm excited
for your surprise.

629
01:02:19,275 --> 01:02:20,977
Chrissy...

630
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,227
Chrissy?

631
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:30,202
Is this
a new phase?

632
01:02:30,227 --> 01:02:32,775
No more blindfold?

633
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,852
Chrissy?

634
01:02:36,977 --> 01:02:38,924
Chrissy's not here.

635
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,352
Fuck you.

636
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:41,602
What?!

637
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:44,477
Are you bored with your friends
that's why you're here?

638
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:46,327
And speaking of friends...

639
01:02:46,352 --> 01:02:49,852
I fucked your best friend
James right here.

640
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,227
And he paid me.

641
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:55,352
Fuck...

642
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:56,852
Precisely.

643
01:03:00,852 --> 01:03:04,508
I fucked your
best friend twice.

644
01:03:06,227 --> 01:03:07,102
Fuck.

645
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:10,352
Here and
in our bathroom.

646
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:13,102
It felt so good.

647
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:22,227
I enjoyed
every bit of it.

648
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:23,227
Fuck!

649
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:26,577
What...

650
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,602
What is happening here?

651
01:03:28,843 --> 01:03:30,187
Fuck.

652
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,102
What are you?

653
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:34,352
Huh? Are you...

654
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:35,852
Are you a prostitute?

655
01:03:36,477 --> 01:03:37,727
Like Chrissy?

656
01:03:37,952 --> 01:03:39,827
Are you a fucking whore?
You're a whore?!

657
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:40,977
Yes!

658
01:03:42,102 --> 01:03:43,352
I'm a whore.

659
01:03:43,977 --> 01:03:45,477
And it's not Chrissy...

660
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:47,688
It's me.

661
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:50,406
You...

662
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:52,727
fucked me.

663
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,602
What's happening here?
Why are you doing this?

664
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,758
You took me for granted.

665
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:05,477
I didn't take you
for granted...

666
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:07,377
I was just working.

667
01:04:07,727 --> 01:04:08,977
You changed...

668
01:04:09,102 --> 01:04:11,352
when we lost the baby!

669
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,102
I was giving you
space to grieve!

670
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:15,477
Space?!

671
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:19,977
Space so you
can fuck around?!

672
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:21,827
It wasn't about 'fucking around!'

673
01:04:21,852 --> 01:04:23,977
You weren't there!
I needed you!

674
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:31,852
When you had
the miscarriage,

675
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:35,602
you're the one who changed.
I don't even know you anymore, Pat!

676
01:04:35,627 --> 01:04:38,156
I don't believe you.

677
01:04:40,352 --> 01:04:43,102
I was grieving too!
I was broken like you!

678
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:45,452
I don't believe you!

679
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:47,203
Stop it!

680
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:50,758
Stop it! Fuck!

681
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:54,148
Stop!

682
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:04,102
No, please...

683
01:05:04,102 --> 01:05:05,727
Not my hand.

684
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,602
Not my hand, please?

685
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:10,852
Please...

686
01:05:13,102 --> 01:05:14,852
Alright, I'll leave.

687
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,977
If that's what you want...
I'll resign from the hospital.

688
01:05:19,227 --> 01:05:20,227
Please.

689
01:05:20,977 --> 01:05:22,602
Please don't.

690
01:05:22,602 --> 01:05:24,352
Just no scandal, okay?

691
01:05:25,977 --> 01:05:27,519
I want everything.

692
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:30,468
Your car...

693
01:05:31,852 --> 01:05:33,102
The house...

694
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:34,502
And money.

695
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,352
- Give me everything.
- Alright.

696
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,102
It's yours.

697
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,312
I need to
go to the hospital.

698
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:07,852
I have all your videos.

699
01:06:12,894 --> 01:06:15,644
I will ruin you, you fuck.

700
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,711
Get out of my life.

701
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:31,852
I'm so sorry.

702
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,312
What are you
going to do now?

703
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:06,070
I don't know.

704
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:10,102
But, doing that to Roy,
seems so satisfying.

705
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:11,502
You know...

706
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:17,102
But, it's not enough.

707
01:07:17,602 --> 01:07:19,102
He's gone, Pat.

708
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:20,873
Yes, he's gone.

709
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:23,500
But, there's still a lot
of them out there.

710
01:07:23,525 --> 01:07:25,977
Like our clients.

711
01:07:26,977 --> 01:07:28,227
My clients.

712
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,377
No.

713
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:32,727
Remember? Leverage?

714
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:34,627
It's bad for
your business.

715
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,602
I'm not satisfied.

716
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:43,055
My revenge to Roy,
it's not enough.

717
01:07:45,054 --> 01:07:47,429
I'll expose all of you...

718
01:07:50,227 --> 01:07:51,648
Cheaters.

719
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,406
Chrissy...

720
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:51,477
Hello?

721
01:09:51,977 --> 01:09:53,352
Chrissy, can you hear me?

722
01:09:53,377 --> 01:09:54,877
Chrissy, hello?

723
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,125
You ruined our lives.

724
01:09:57,602 --> 01:09:59,727
I'll find you, you whore!

725
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:01,875
Fuck you, whore!

726
01:10:02,227 --> 01:10:04,077
Whoever you are...

727
01:10:04,102 --> 01:10:08,552
If you're a wife
cheated by your husband,

728
01:10:08,577 --> 01:10:10,077
I'm on your side.

729
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,602
You are a bitch
and you will die!

730
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:19,352
One more threat...

731
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:22,186
and I'll release
all the videos.

732
01:10:22,477 --> 01:10:24,852
Including yours
whoever you are.

733
01:10:25,977 --> 01:10:27,602
Stop bothering me!

734
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:28,727
My husband
took his own life.

735
01:11:28,977 --> 01:11:30,477
Because of you.

736
01:11:31,394 --> 01:11:32,352
You whore!

737
01:11:32,602 --> 01:11:36,414
- I have nothing to do with that.
- I don't care if he fucks around!

738
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:39,394
I don't care because
he still goes home!

739
01:11:39,602 --> 01:11:42,602
You ruined our family.
You bitch!

740
01:11:44,894 --> 01:11:46,144
Fuck you!

741
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:04,125
You killed my husband!
Whore! You're a whore!

742
01:12:05,577 --> 01:12:08,366
Fuck you!

743
01:12:21,977 --> 01:12:24,352
My husband is not perfect.

744
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:26,727
But, I love him.

745
01:12:26,727 --> 01:12:28,227
And this...

746
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,186
is his gun.

747
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:18,352
I'm not a whore.

748
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:20,977
Those men are satisfied.

749
01:14:21,048 --> 01:14:22,953
I get paid.

750
01:14:27,187 --> 01:14:29,437
It's a fair transaction.

751
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:37,144
I have two jobs now
and working from home.

752
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,242
See?

753
01:14:43,267 --> 01:14:44,851
Look at this guy.

754
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:48,089
Not the dating material.

755
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:51,500
But he pays big.

756
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,031
I just got paid.
