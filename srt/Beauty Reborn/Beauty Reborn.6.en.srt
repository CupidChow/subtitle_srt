1
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,400
<i>Once I was sure Pong was one of them,</i>

2
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,920
<i>I told the cops to tail you.</i>

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,040
And they caught him red-handed.

4
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,440
<i>Sara and I… We're getting married.</i>

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Now you're using money</i>
<i>to make my sister marry you?</i>

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
What will come next?

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,160
So, how about this?

8
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Let time be the proof

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
that I didn't force Sara.

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,960
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
<i>Can you come to my condo?</i>

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
Eyes! Eyes!

13
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>You used the advance</i>
<i>to help your ex pay her debts?</i>

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
<i>Mr. Chakrit caught that</i>

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,960
<i>Mr. Pathawee used company funds</i>
<i>for personal matters.</i>

17
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,160
So, he must take responsibility
by resigning from his position.

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
Isn't that right, Mr. Pathawee?

19
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,240
Uncle Perm.

20
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,280
Now I hate my claustrophobia the most.

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
I couln't even use the elevator!

22
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
The documents in everyone's hands

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,240
are proof that every single baht
has been returned to the company.

24
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
The total matches exactly with
the evidence Mr. Chakrit showed earlier.

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,760
If you look at the date and time,

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
Mr. Chakrit's document came out first.

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,560
As for Mr. Pathawee's,

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
it was issued just this morning.

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,520
I had an urgent personal matter
and needed the money quickly,

30
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
but I returned it

31
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,680
within a very short time.

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
I understand it was inappropriate.

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,360
I sincerely apologize
to everyone once again.

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,440
Using company money
for personal matters is wrong,

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
even if you've already paid it back!

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
Everyone,

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
don't let him off the hook.

38
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Someone like this deserves to be removed!

39
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,200
This company doesn't belong
to you alone, Mr. Chakrit.

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Whether Mr. Pathawee stays or goes,

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
let everyone decide together.

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
Stay out of this!

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,880
Alright then.

44
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,480
Please don't side with me

45
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,080
just because
of our friendship or familiarity.

46
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,680
I take full responsibility for what I did.

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's put it to a vote.

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,720
If anyone believes
I'm no longer fit for this position,

49
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,640
please raise your hand.

50
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
Mr. Din.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
How are you? You doing okay?

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
News travels fast. Worried about me?

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Well…

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,720
Good thing you still have some merit left.

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
You're Suthee's daughter?

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Hello, Auntie.

57
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Haven't seen you in years. You look
just like your mother when she was young.

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,920
I'll be heading off now.

59
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
Yes, ma'am.
I'll have someone get the car ready.

60
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,680
You know someone's eyeing your position.

61
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,480
Be more careful with what you do.

62
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Right.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
So weak in the knees already?

64
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,600
My knees hurt.

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
I ran up the stairs
because I'm claustrophobic.

66
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,520
That's a lot of floors, you know.

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
Didn't know you were impatient.

68
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you smiling?

69
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
Thank you

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
for worrying about me.

71
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,040
I only worried because
I was the one who gave you the advice.

72
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,000
If you'd been removed from your position,

73
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,640
I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Hey, hey.

75
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,640
Mr. Din! What are you doing?

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
Stay still.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
Well…

78
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,240
You said your legs hurt.

79
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
So, I'm massaging them for you.

80
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,000
No need.

81
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,720
I can do it myself. Someone might see us.

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,680
-Stop it.
-That's even better.

83
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,560
They'll see how well I take care of you.

84
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,720
-Here, right?
-Yes.

85
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,680
So tell me,

86
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,440
whose money did you borrow
to pay the company back?

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,320
Hey!

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,320
It's a calf strain, not a cramp! It hurts!

89
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,800
2,000,000.00 RECEIVED
REMAINING BALANCE: 2,356,589.00

90
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
Why pay it back so soon?

91
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,840
I told you, it's idle money.
I wasn't going to use it anyway.

92
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,760
You're already making me
feel guilty enough.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,080
You warned me and even lent me money.

94
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,120
Hello, Baicha. What's up?

95
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
<i>Have you gotten home yet, Din?</i>

96
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Not yet. I'm on my way. What's wrong?

97
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,440
Can you stop by my café for a bit?

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,240
By the time I get there, it'll be closed.

99
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,720
Good.

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,160
Because I have something really important

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
I want to talk to you about.

102
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
Alright then, I'll come right away.

103
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,280
So, what will you do next, Din?

104
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't know yet.

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,120
Two million isn't a small amount.

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,680
And the deadline's coming up fast.

107
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
If it were just a few days,
I could borrow from friends.

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,160
Then, you could use my money
to tide things over for now.

109
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
I can't do that.

110
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,680
It's not a small sum.
I'm already grateful that you warned me.

111
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Trust me, Din.

112
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
Put the money
into the company account first.

113
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,280
Then wait
until the shareholders' meeting is over.

114
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
It might not fix everything,

115
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
but it should help a little.

116
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,800
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in real trouble.

117
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,080
I feel bad too,
having to betray Krit like that.

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,120
But I couldn't just stand by and watch
you suffer because of my brother.

119
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

120
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,840
No, I should be the one
apologizing for Krit,

121
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,720
for always stirring things up.

122
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,080
I just don't understand

123
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,280
how long he'll hold this grudge,

124
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,920
when it all started with our parents.

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Anyway, I really have to thank you
for helping me.

126
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,200
If not for you,
I would've lost my position.

127
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,800
Is that it?

128
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,480
Why is it that

129
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,200
for someone
who caused you trouble, like Eyes,

130
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
or someone you just met, like Ms. Sarah,

131
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,560
you'd go as far as marrying her,

132
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
but you never cared for me?

133
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,520
It's not that I don't care for you.

134
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,760
But I see you like a little sister.

135
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
I really can't think of you any other way.

136
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,240
Even though I'm grown up?

137
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
No matter

138
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,200
how good I am to you?

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,480
Din.

141
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,360
If Nam says he won't give up on Ms. Sarah,

142
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
then I won't give up on you either.

143
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,400
Where were you praying
to get out of that alive?

144
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,640
Company accounting

145
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,000
is internal.

146
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,520
It's odd that Chakrit knew

147
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,400
and even had the transfer records.

148
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,800
Well…

149
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
I was the one who told him.

150
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,160
Nam!

151
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
Is that what you wanted to hear?

152
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
You want me to be the bad guy?

153
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll be the bad guy.

154
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Happy now, Din?

155
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,560
You think you could stoop to dirty tricks
to make Ms. Sarah marry you,

156
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,280
so you assume
I'd use dirty tactics like you?

157
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,360
I would never do something I despise.

158
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll beat you the right way.

159
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,960
And I'll make Ms. Sarah see my worth.

160
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,080
Sorry for the trouble I caused, Din.

161
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,160
It's all right.

162
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
It's over now, and I pulled through.

163
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,720
I promise
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

164
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,640
Just do what you can.

165
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't pressure yourself.

166
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,400
I once lost you, Din.

167
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't want money
to make me lose you again.

168
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,040
Nam told me you had to marry Ms. Sarah

169
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,360
because of company problems.

170
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,680
Is that true?

171
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
Do you think it's true?

172
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,520
From what I know of you, I believe it is.

173
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,440
When you set your mind on something,
you always see it through,

174
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,080
even if it costs you,

175
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,520
even if it hurts so bad.

176
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,640
So, why couldn't you
force yourself to do this too?

177
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Honestly, I'm not being forced that much.

178
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,640
I've known Sara since we were kids,

179
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,520
even before I met you.

180
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,880
She's kind,

181
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
strong,

182
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,680
and family-oriented.

183
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,520
I don't think

184
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
I made the wrong choice.

185
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
You praise her so much,

186
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,360
now I kind of want
to meet this woman myself.

187
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,000
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

188
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
Who's gossiping about me now?

189
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,079
You've been gossiped about nonstop.
I've seen you sneeze a few times.

190
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,200
Is it gossip or just allergies?

191
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,079
The weather's been changing lately.

192
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,880
-Mr. Din.
-Hello.

193
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,400
I brought meals for everyone.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
Thanks so much.

195
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,680
I'll head to class.

196
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,200
Aren't you going to eat first?

197
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,760
-Mr. Din even brought food.
-No, thanks.

198
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Sorry about him.

199
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,400
Don't worry, I understand.

200
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
So, shall we eat together then?

201
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,680
Sure.

202
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,840
I'll help.

203
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,800
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

204
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,560
Hello. Please pick me up
in front of the hospital.

205
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,080
-Thanks so much.
-Alright.

206
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,560
Go sit and eat with Mr. Din.

207
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,440
I can eat right here.

208
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay.

209
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,280
Hey.

210
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Is this Sarach's?

211
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,560
Yes. He was so upset,
he forgot to grab it all.

212
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,280
Call him right now and tell him.
You might still catch him.

213
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Okay.

214
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,280
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

215
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,600
He doesn't pick up?

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
He probably rode off on the motorbike.

217
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,480
Should we bring it to the campus then?

218
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,240
-It's nearby.
-But…

219
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
You still haven't eaten.

220
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,880
It's okay.

221
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,200
We'll be back soon.

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,960
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

223
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,000
What's up? If you're calling
to complain about Din, I'm hanging up.

224
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,840
Oh, right.

225
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,000
I forgot.

226
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
Meet me at the back gate then.

227
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,720
You can circle around.
Traffic's bad at the front gate.

228
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,080
What did Sarach say?

229
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,600
He said to meet behind the campus

230
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
because the front gate's clogged.

231
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,600
I'll check the map for you.

232
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,080
Pong?

233
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,920
You called the cops on me, didn't you?

234
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,640
Hey. Beat him up.

235
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Sarach!

236
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
Mr. Din!

237
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,520
Help! Help!

238
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,680
Mr. Din…

239
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,840
Hey! Who the hell?!

240
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,960
Let me go!

241
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,240
Mr. Din! Mr. Din.

242
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,760
Help! Help! Someone please help!

243
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,680
Help! Mr. Din!

244
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,600
-Are you a relative of the patient?
-Yes.

245
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,880
How is he doing?

246
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,800
He asked for you.

247
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,640
But don't worry.

248
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,800
The doctors are doing their best.

249
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,720
Din! Din!

250
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,120
Well…

251
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,360
He seems fine.

252
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,080
Who told you I was going to die?

253
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,000
The patient's safe.

254
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,280
It was a glancing stab, not deep.

255
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,800
No vital organs were hit.

256
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,040
Get the meds, and you can go home.

257
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,360
Thank you so much, Doctor.

258
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,600
The nurse said you asked to see me.

259
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,000
I thought you were in a coma,
about to say your last words.

260
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,240
You should write novels, honestly.

261
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,440
So, why did you want me here?

262
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,400
My clothes were torn, and there was blood.

263
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I just wanted you
to grab a shirt from my car.

264
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,200
You could've told the nurse.

265
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
What?

266
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
It's all in your head,
and now you blame everyone.

267
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
What's with you?

268
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Making that face,
aren't you glad I'm okay?

269
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,240
Of course I am.

270
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
So glad I could stab you myself
with my own hands.

271
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,320
How violent.

272
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,760
If it had been a bit lower,
you'd have ended up with a trans buddy.

273
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
What?

274
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,440
You… You pervert. That's disgusting!

275
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Lower your voice.

276
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,440
This is a hospital.

277
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,240
Still, thank you.

278
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,400
For what?

279
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,200
For calling me just "Din."

280
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,960
I'd like to hear it again.

281
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,320
Din. Din…

282
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
Din…

283
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Call me again, please.

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,680
What? You just called me that.

285
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
-What's wrong with saying it again? Din…
-Ugh.

286
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,360
The closer the gift set launch gets,
the more stressed I become.

287
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,160
If it's launch day, I won't sleep.

288
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,640
I think I'm a workaholic.

289
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,520
But you're worse than me.

290
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
So, you owe me a big raise.

291
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,040
Are you okay? Does the wound hurt?

292
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah, it stings sometimes,
but it's nothing serious.

293
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,240
I think you should go get some rest.

294
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
Look at you.

295
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,000
You're hurt and still talking so much.

296
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,320
If that wound rips open
from your babbling, I'll make it worse.

297
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,520
Why are you smiling?

298
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,400
Did getting stabbed in the stomach
rattle your brain?

299
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm smiling because
you're fussing over me.

300
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Even when I say I'm fine,
you still held on to me all the way here.

301
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,120
Well, you're hurt because

302
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,880
you helped my brother,

303
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,000
so I have to look after you.

304
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
It's nothing really.

305
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,800
I wasn't complaining.

306
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,880
If we're not in front of others,
there's no need to put on a show.

307
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm taking care of Mr. Din

308
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,320
because he helped my brother.

309
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
I heard about it from Yo.

310
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,520
Din's not hurt that much.

311
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
Or is he just pulling
another trick to fool you?

312
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,800
That's your brother, you know.

313
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,360
I don't think you should be talking

314
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,360
about your own brother like that.

315
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
Are you defending him?

316
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
You forgot…

317
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,400
Forgot what?

318
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,000
You could've just called me.

319
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,600
I would've come to you.

320
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,240
You were just being helped
walking a moment ago.

321
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,240
How are you walking in so casually now?

322
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,040
I told you,

323
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
you can't beat my brother's game.

324
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,480
Whether it's true or not, I don't care.

325
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,560
But the fact that he got hurt
because of my brother, that's real.

326
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
And that's enough for me.

327
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,280
Is his money really enough
to buy you off this much?

328
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Don't talk to Sara like that.

329
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,280
You should work in my office instead.

330
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,600
That way, you won't have to get upset
over losers like this.

331
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
Let's go.

332
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,240
You insult me and walk away?

333
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,040
Mr. Nam!

334
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,760
Mr. Din!

335
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,440
Din…

336
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Hey, stop! Stop.

337
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,120
I told you to stop!

338
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I said stop!

339
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,600
-Hey.
-Hey.

340
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,800
Are you hurt?

341
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,520
You two are executives here.

342
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Pull yourselves together.

343
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,000
If you use your fists
instead of your heads,

344
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,440
there's nothing left to discuss.

345
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,320
You still haven't forgiven me?

346
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,400
The one who should apologize…

348
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
is actually me.

349
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,920
Because I was in trouble with money

350
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,560
and had to bother you,

351
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,640
and it even led to you
fighting your own brother.

352
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,160
Honestly,

353
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,760
I feel awful about it.

354
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,120
Don't blame yourself.

355
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,560
Nam and I dragged you into this mess.

356
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,120
This has nothing to do with you.

357
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,320
But still,

358
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,120
I can't help feeling upset.

359
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,640
Ms. Eyes?

360
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,680
Is there something you need from me?

361
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,000
I already know everything
about you and Din, and about Nam too.

362
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,800
Who will you choose?

363
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,880
Between Din and Nam?

364
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,760
If I get to choose,

365
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I'd choose not to answer that.

366
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay, then I'll change the question.

367
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,760
Between Din and Nam, who do you like more?

368
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
Why would you show this to me?

369
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,400
Don't tell me this is a photo of you.

370
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes. It's me when I was a child.

371
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
Before the accident.

372
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,440
Before I had surgery.

373
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,240
Stir-fried morning glory.

374
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Heat the pan. When it's hot,

375
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,200
pour in the oil like this.

376
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,320
Then add the morning glory.

377
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,480
Finish up and plate it like this.

378
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,400
-You can try.
-Okay.

379
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,240
THREE MONTHS LATER

380
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,720
Mr. Din.

381
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
What?

382
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,120
Didn't you ask me

383
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,360
who I liked better?

384
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,640
If you knew what's happening now,

385
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,560
you'd know I used to live
at Phimarndech house when I was a kid.

386
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,040
Back then,

387
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,960
the only person who ever saw me
for who I really was…

388
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
was Mr. Din.

389
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,120
The reason I didn't answer

390
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,840
when you asked who I'd choose

391
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,960
is because I wasn't the one

392
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
making that choice.

393
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,199
You're not just beautiful,
you're smart too, aren't you?

394
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,840
If no one knew
you'd had plastic surgery before,

395
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
I could've used that to expose you
and score points with Din.

396
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,679
Too bad that trick won't work now.

397
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
If it had worked,
it would've been good for everyone.

398
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,840
No, it wouldn't.

399
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,159
Because Din has feelings for you too.

400
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,640
Thanks for being willing to talk.

401
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
I think you still have a choice.

402
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,720
What do you mean?

403
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,680
Well, you and Din aren't married yet.

404
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
You still have time to rethink this.

405
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,760
It might already be too late.

406
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,480
But I still want you to reconsider.

407
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,560
Because I want to get back with Din,

408
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,720
but I can't, not while you're here.

409
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,040
If you're hesitating about marrying him,

410
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,280
it means you don't love him.

411
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,840
Not the way I do.

412
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,240
Then please give Din back to me.

413
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,240
I want to take care of him.

414
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,040
I want to repay the kindness he showed me.

415
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,640
You're a woman too.
You should understand how I feel.

416
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,320
Wait.

417
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,040
What happened to your face?

418
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,200
Oh, it's nothing much.

419
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,280
Nam's face has bruises too.

420
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,800
You two have been fighting, haven't you?

421
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,360
Yes.

422
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,040
Was it because of Suthee's daughter?

423
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,520
He's crazy about her.

424
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,640
Even after announcing the wedding,
it's still chaos.

425
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,320
You've got to do something about it.

426
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,480
There's probably only one way left.

427
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,640
-<i>When will you deal with this?</i>
-<i>Next week.</i>

428
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
<i>What were you talking about?</i>

429
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,440
What's happening next week?

430
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,680
<i>Just seeing their faces drives me crazy.</i>

431
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,120
Now I have to live
under the same roof as them.

432
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,040
<i>What are you doing? I'm not playing.</i>

433
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,960
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>just a pillow and a blanket</i>

434
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,440
<i>will actually keep me away?</i>

435
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,760
Mr. Din, we have a big issue.

436
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,680
If I ask for a seat on the board,

437
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,520
what will you say, Din?

438
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,360
<i>Who do you want on the board?</i>

439
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,480
Tonight…
I'll make you forget all about it.

440
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,920
