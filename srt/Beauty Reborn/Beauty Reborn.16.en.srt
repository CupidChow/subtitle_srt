1
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
<i>The person you should</i>
<i>really be taking care of is Namnuan.</i>

2
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,400
<i>But she doesn't love me.</i>

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,880
Even if she doesn't love you,
she's the only one who raised you.

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,480
She devoted everything to you,

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,480
even though she never had to.

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,240
What? Nam was assaulted?

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Let go of me. I said let go, you liar!

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,880
I love you, Baicha. When I realized
you'd disappeared, I nearly lost my mind.

9
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,320
<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>I'd do anything not to lose you.</i>

10
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm sorry. I know I hurt you.

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,200
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
<i>I can't forgive you.</i>

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,600
I hereby resign from my position as CEO.

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,960
<i>And I appoint Mr. Chakrit</i>

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,640
<i>to assume the position</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
<i>I won't let him control everything.</i>

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,920
<i>Let them keep each other in check.</i>

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
That way, we benefit.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>
<i>You disappear without saying a word.</i>

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Uncle?

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Uncle, can you hear me?

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
Alright.

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
Have some yourself.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Yes.

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,440
Hello.

26
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
What did you say?

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
METROPOLITAN POLICE
ROYAL THAI POLICE

28
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,560
Do you remember
why you were there with Mr. Praphop?

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,560
No.

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
I really don't know what happened.

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,680
Have you ever had
any quarrels with him before?

32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,040
We don't have any problems.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,800
But I've been informed

34
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
you have conflicts
at the company, don't you?

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
It's just a general business matter.

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,560
It's not so serious
that we have to hurt each other.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,080
Mr. Praphop is generous to him.

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,840
Even when he was sick yesterday,

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
Mr. Praphop personally took care of him.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,960
It's a privilege to work with you.
Thank you very much.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,280
Likewise. I'll take my leave now.

42
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm needed at another meeting.

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,440
Oh, really? Then please feel free.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,640
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes. Goodbye.

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,800
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

46
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
- Escort him, will you?
- Goodbye.

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
Goodbye.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Well, Din, let's talk about bringing
the company to the exchange now.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
Come on.

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
Uh, what?

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,760
Din, are you okay?

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,240
You've seemed a bit off
for a little while.

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,400
Actually, I…

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm allergic to pollen,
and I didn't bring any meds.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
- Oh?
- Oh, really?

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,560
Whoa, give it to me. Oh.

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,320
Then I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,960
If I had known, I would have told them
not to bring a bouquet. Sorry.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
- It's okay, Uncle.
- Here, here. Take it out.

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,480
Sorry to trouble you all.

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,440
Hey, you sure you're alright?

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Wow.

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Hey, hey. Whoa.

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,320
Hey, can you continue working?
Are you alright?

65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,720
- I'm fine. I just need a little break.
- Huh?

66
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,840
Really? Do you need any meds,
or do you need to see a doctor?

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,560
<i>After that, I had to go to an event,</i>

68
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,640
so he had the driver take me there.

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
He personally took Pathawee
to the hospital.

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,480
Why? Why would he do this?

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,560
It's not true. I saw them
have a very heated argument yesterday.

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,120
I told you to list
the company on the exchange.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
- <i>I was about to head home</i>
- This is my father's company.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
- <i>and saw Mr. Praphop and Pathawee</i>
- You can't make this decision.

75
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,480
- <i>fighting</i>
- Are you testing my patience, Din?

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,400
Stop! Back off, Din.

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,920
<i>It was about the shares</i>
<i>that Pathawee didn't want</i>

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,360
- <i>to be listed on the exchange.</i>
- Touch me again and…

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
<i>When they both saw me,</i>

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,000
<i>they stopped arguing</i>

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
<i>and split up.</i>

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,880
<i>I was shocked when I found out.</i>

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,320
We don't always see eye to eye
as shareholders,

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,720
but Mr. Pathawee is usually
a calm and very kind person.

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
I don't know what enraged him so much
that he hurt Mr. Praphop.

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,440
Are you okay?

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,120
It hurts so much.

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,520
Where does it hurt? Are you patched up?

89
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
It hurts my heart.

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,480
I don't want you to see me like this.

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
What's wrong with seeing you like this?

92
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Or you don't want to see me?

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Of course I do.

94
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,000
But…

95
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
I just don't want to see you upset.

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
I'd rather see you…

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
when you're happy.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,480
Our lives aren't always
sunshine and rainbows.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,560
If you ever fall,
I'll sit right by your side

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,840
until you're back on your feet.

101
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,240
Through thick and thin,

102
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,080
I will be with you.

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
Mr. Pathawee.

104
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
Mr. Pathawee.

105
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,960
Follow me.

106
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Where?

107
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Your blood test results are out.

108
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,360
No drug components were found
as you had testified.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
But the doctor stated
that the allergy meds you took

110
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,840
may be an old formula that was metabolized
quickly, making it undetectable.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,720
When there is no clear evidence
that you're innocent or you're a culprit,

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
we'll take your word for it.

113
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,560
Thank you very much.

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
But we may invite you to testify again,

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,680
since you're still a suspect.

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm well aware.

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Please.

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
Hey.

120
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Hey.

121
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
How did you get here?

122
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,520
Did they release you?

123
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes.

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,120
So…

125
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,080
Did you wait for me here all night?

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,520
I already told you.

127
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,840
I'll be with you through thick and thin.

128
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,440
Thank you.

129
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,920
You must be exhausted.
We should go home and rest.

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,760
I'd like to stop by one place first.

Hello, Auntie. I--

135
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,400
Do you still dare show your face?

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
No! Please don't. Please.

137
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,680
I really didn't hurt Uncle Praphop.

138
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
Leave now. I don't want to see your face.

139
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,400
We have disagreements.

140
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
But what you did to my husband,

141
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,840
leaving him in a coma like this,
is far too much.

142
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,120
Just like you said.

143
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,800
Even if we have problems,

144
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,320
but doing this is too much.
Do you really think I would do it?

145
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Just ask yourself why you did it.

146
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,560
Auntie.

147
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm not begging you to believe us.

148
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,160
But if Mr. Din really did it,

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,240
the police wouldn't
let him walk like this.

150
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
Do you remember

151
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,920
that I had a reaction to pollen that day?

152
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,840
It had gotten worse after that,

153
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,440
so Uncle told me to rest in the car.

154
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
Din.

155
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,800
It seems to have gotten even worse.
Let me help.

156
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,000
No. It's okay, Uncle.

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Come on. Don't push yourself. Come.

158
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,160
That's the last thing I remember.

159
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,000
You can even check Mr. Din's
medical records to confirm his allergies.

160
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,840
He always gets drowsy
after taking the medicine.

161
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
Let alone hurting someone,

162
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
he’d be out cold
before he could even blink.

163
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Please, Auntie.

164
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
I just want to visit him, that's all.

165
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Follow me.

167
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,440
What did the doctor say?

168
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
The doctor said that

169
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,840
he was hit in the head
with a hard, blunt object.

170
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
No one knows when he'll be conscious.

171
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,200
I understand how you feel.

172
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,920
I promise

173
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,640
I will find the truth to prove
I had nothing to do with this

174
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
and to get justice for Uncle.

175
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,160
If you can do that, then good.

176
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,400
You should be resting at home.
Hurrying here like this is…

177
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,120
I can't wait even a second.

178
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,720
The more evidence I can find, the better.

179
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
What are you doing?

180
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Protecting the company.

181
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
A suspect
like you shouldn't set foot here.

182
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,760
The police haven't concluded that yet.
What's the hurry?

183
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,360
I just don't want to let someone like you
ruin the company's reputation.

184
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,600
From now on,
don't ever let Mr. Pathawee enter.

185
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,760
Post a notice with his picture.
Understood?

186
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,040
This is too much.

188
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
Why are you two still here?

189
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
Or do you want security to drag you out?

190
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,000
You win, for now.

191
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Let's go.

192
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,680
Don'y worry, Mr. Din. We have
a lot of old-timers on our side.

193
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,560
You just have to ask,
and I’ll dig up whatever you need.

194
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,840
Thank you so much, Uncle Perm.

195
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,160
Where would you like me to start?

196
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
I have a feeling something strange
is going on at the company.

197
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,240
At first, I didn't suspect anything.

198
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,280
But when I think about it,
some unusual stuff did happen.

199
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,720
What is it?

200
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,040
After I finished talking to Uncle Praphop…

201
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,720
Sit down for a bit.
I'll take you to the doctor.

202
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
Oh, I'm really okay.

203
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,880
Just take a break. See?

204
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,040
I was so careless, and look at you now.

205
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh.

206
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
It's okay, really.
I don't want to trouble you.

207
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,400
I can drive to the hospital myself.
Or you can just

208
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,720
have your driver take me there instead.

209
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
Rosarin has somewhere to go,

210
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,640
so I already had him drive her there.

211
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,120
I want to drive you myself,
so I can be sure you're fine.

212
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
Then thank you very much.

213
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
Sit here for a bit, then.
I need to go oversee a few things.

214
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,040
Alright.

215
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
Excuse me.

216
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,160
Mr. Pathawee, please
take some allergy medicine.

217
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
Medicine?

218
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,520
Yes, Mr. Praphop told me to bring you
this medicine to soothe your reaction.

219
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,800
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
Whoa, Din.

221
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,520
You've been sitting down for a while.
Aren't you feeling better?

222
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,680
I’ve already taken the medicine

223
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,240
you left with the housekeeper.
It will take effect soon.

224
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,160
What medicine? I didn't
ask anyone to give you medicine.

225
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,800
Oh? But then…

226
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,960
Hey.

227
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,240
It seems your symptoms are getting worse.
Let's just go to the doctor.

228
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,760
Right.

229
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,360
<i>Then, I came down</i>
<i>to the parking lot with him.</i>

230
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,520
<i>But I felt so dizzy at the time.</i>

231
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,120
- <i>So, he helped me to his car.</i>
- Are you really okay?

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't worry. I'll take you
to the doctor, alright?

233
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,680
No need to hesitate. Let's go.

234
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

235
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,680
Hang in there. Stay strong.
I'll drive you to the hospital.

236
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
Yes…

237
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
I've gone over the timeline carefully.

238
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
There's a very strong possibility
that I was…

239
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,000
Drugged.

240
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,520
That's right.

241
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,600
To accuse me of assaulting Uncle Praphop.

242
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,280
Then the most suspicious one
is that housekeeper.

243
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Yes.

244
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,320
If we can find her, it won't
be hard to find the mastermind.

245
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,360
Who do you think it is?

246
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
At the company,

247
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,640
there are very few people
who can order the staff

248
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
to do just anything.

249
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
As everyone knows,

250
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,880
Mr. Praphop was assaulted
and still hasn't regained consciousness.

251
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,840
And the prime suspect
in this case is Mr. Pathawee,

252
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
one of our executives.

253
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,800
So I suggest delaying
the capital raise and the IPO

254
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,680
until all outstanding issues are resolved.

255
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,640
But Mr. Praphop has already approved
the capital increase plan.

256
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
If we suspend it now,

257
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,840
- we’re going to have liquidity problems.
- Yes.

258
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,120
We've prepared a press release
regarding the IPO as well.

259
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
If we delay it,

260
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,200
it will undermine market confidence.

261
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,160
And what if we proceed
with the IPO announcement

262
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,640
and the press starts digging
into what just happened?

263
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,760
Do you think
it will be good for the company?

264
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,720
We’d better wait
for Mr. Praphop to recover

265
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,520
and for the situation to clear up
before we move forward.

266
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,320
That way, we can prevent further damage
to the company's reputation.

267
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
Isn't it better?

268
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,080
If everyone's okay with it,
then we will all agree to this.

269
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,040
As far as I know, the one who gave you
the medicine is a housekeeper named Noi.

270
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,920
Is this her, Mr. Din?

271
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,480
Yes, I remember her face.

272
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Is there anything else you've learned?

273
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
This housekeeper named Noi
was the only one

274
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,520
who took care of the building that day.

275
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
But surprisingly,

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
she resigned on the day of the incident.

277
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,240
This is so obvious, isn't it?
Find out her address, Uncle Perm.

278
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,960
Oh, I already did.
I'll send it to you now.

279
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
And I also heard that

280
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Noi ran away to hide
with relatives in the suburbs.

281
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Mr. Din, I think you should be careful.

282
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,720
The person who caused this much trouble

283
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
must have prepared an escape plan.

284
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
Thank you, Uncle Perm.

285
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,240
Nam, let's go.

286
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,840
I'm going too.

287
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,600
No, you wait here.

288
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,640
- But…
- Wait here,

289
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,640
so I can be sure you'll be okay,

290
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,800
alright?

291
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,240
Then you’d better
come back here in one piece.

292
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,480
Otherwise, I… I'd never forgive you.

293
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,440
I promise.

294
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,600
Nam.

295
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,560
Wow, he's sweeter than honey.

296
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,280
It should be this house.

297
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,280
No more looking around.
Let's ring the bell and find out.

298
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,000
Hey, Nam!

299
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,840
If you press that much,
they will come out and curse you.

300
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,560
They'd better come out. Look.

301
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Silent as a graveyard.

302
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,360
Not coming to curse us?

303
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,960
It's really unusual.

304
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,240
If they don't come out, we'll break in.

305
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,480
Hey, Nam. This is trespassing.

306
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
I’d rather trespass

307
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
than stand here waiting for nothing
and possibly letting her escape.

308
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,440
Alright.

309
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
Go.

310
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Aunt Noi.

311
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
Aunt Noi.

312
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,240
Aunt Noi.

313
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,080
Aunt Noi. Aunt Noi.

314
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
Aunt Noi.

315
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
Aunt Noi.

316
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,880
Aunt Noi.

317
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
Aunt Noi!

318
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,960
- Whoa.
- Nam, dodge.

319
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
She could have killed us.

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,040
Aunt Noi.

321
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,760
Aunt Noi.

322
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,920
Aunt Noi. Aunt Noi!

323
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Aunt Noi. Aunt Noi.

324
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,120
- Aunt Noi.
- Aunt Noi.

325
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,280
Aunt Noi!

326
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
Aunt Noi!

327
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,720
- Help! Help!
- Aunt Noi, stop.

328
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,520
Aunt Noi.

329
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,840
They're trying to kill me!

330
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,120
Aunt Noi. Aunt Noi.

331
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Aunt Noi.

332
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
- Hey, stop! Stop!
- Stop right there!

333
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,640
Trying to kill someone in broad daylight?

334
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
What do we do?

335
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
What is this?

336
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
- Right?
- Split up.

337
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,080
- What?!
- Hey, hey!

338
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,800
- Huh?
- Hey, stop!

339
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,320
- Run, Aunt Noi! Run!
- Let go!

340
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Let go of me.

341
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,560
Stop here. Let me go with you.

342
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,600
Hurry.

343
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,080
Din.

344
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,720
We blew it.

345
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,440
So you went there for nothing.

346
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,680
But even if we hadn't shown up,

347
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,120
Aunt Noi was planning
to run away today anyway.

348
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,320
Yeah, she was packing up.

349
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,360
A little more gently, please, Baicha.

350
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm being gentle.
You can do it yourself if you want.

351
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,600
At least it confirms our theory.

352
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,280
Someone really used
this housekeeper to set you up.

353
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,120
And they also went as far
as sending someone to silence her.

354
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,400
They must be really careful
to stay hidden from us.

355
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,760
In that case, we need to find
her fast and get her to testify.

356
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,280
But I'm afraid it's too late.

357
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,000
Why, Mom?

358
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,640
The police came to arrest you again, Din.

359
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,760
We have new evidence

360
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,160
that proves you're the one
who hurt Mr. Praphop.

361
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,120
I'm sure I didn't hurt him.

362
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,040
That day…

363
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,000
We have evidence from CCTV footage.

364
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,640
It clearly shows
the last person with Mr. Praphop

365
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,080
was you.

366
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
If you don't believe me,

367
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,160
then see for yourself.

368
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,120
CCTV footage from the exit
to the parking lot

369
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,560
clearly shows that you
were with Mr. Praphop.

370
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,560
I don't see how it can be evidence
to incriminate me.

371
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,600
From our investigation,

372
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Mr. Praphop's car has not stopped anywhere
since leaving the company.

373
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,120
And the last person
who was with Mr. Praphop

374
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,520
was you. It can only mean one thing.

375
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,800
That I'm the culprit?

376
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
Officer.

377
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,560
I had a severe allergic reaction
to pollen that day.

378
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,280
The CCTV footage clearly shows
that I was sneezing and staggering.

379
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,120
Could I really hurt him in that condition?

380
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,440
You might just be pretending.

381
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,560
I think your baseless accusation

382
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,760
is completely unfair.

383
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,000
More importantly,

384
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,400
that CCTV footage

385
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,160
never actually shows me
hurting Mr. Praphop.

386
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,280
How can you be so sure that I did it?

387
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,440
I think you shouldn't try to make excuses.

388
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
The circumstantial evidence
is crystal clear.

389
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
It's just circumstantial evidence.

390
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,840
There isn't a single eyewitness.

391
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll say it once more.

392
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,400
I didn't hurt Uncle Praphop.

393
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,600
How did it go?

394
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,920
Go on home without me.

395
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
No.

396
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,120
If they won't release you,
I won't go either.

397
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,920
We can't release him yet, ma'am.

398
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,960
We have to detain
Mr. Pathawee here for now.

399
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,320
How long will it be?

400
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,080
As long as the process requires.

401
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,480
Don't worry about me.

402
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,120
I can take care of myself.

403
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,840
Go home and rest for now.

404
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,080
Didn't you say

405
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,560
it felt good having me watch over you?

406
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,080
But now I don't want you
to suffer because of me again.

407
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,199
Please go home. I beg you.

408
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,639
Mr. Pathawee, please.

409
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
Hey!

410
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,720
Who sent you?

411
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
Help!

412
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
Anybody, help!

413
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

414
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm stressing out right now.

415
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,920
Please let me recharge here.

416
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,560
It's truly exhausting this time.

417
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,080
So, what are you gonna do next, Din?

418
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,840
The police have all this CCTV footage.

419
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,880
<i>He'll be awake in no time.</i>

420
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,640
We'll soon know
who had the audacity to do this to him.

421
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,360
Consider this another chance
from me. But don't forget

422
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,480
to keep your promise.

423
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,920
<i>Chakrit said he didn't hire anybody.</i>

424
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,840
<i>So there's not enough evidence</i>
<i>to find out who hurt Uncle Praphop.</i>

425
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,920
<i>Officer, don't you suspect</i>

426
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,680
<i>that Mr. Pathawee might have</i>
<i>orchestrated this whole situation himself?</i>

427
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,600
I take full responsibility.

428
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,720
<i>Once we're separated</i>

429
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,640
and unable to contact each other,

430
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,400
ask the nurse to check
the CCTV footage right away.

431
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,320
Is that really necessary?

432
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,280
We'll only be apart for a few minutes.

433
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,920
