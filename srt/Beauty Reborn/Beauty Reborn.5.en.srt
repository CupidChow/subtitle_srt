1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,200
<i>I'm sorry for everything I've done before.</i>

2
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,760
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>why I treated you so badly.</i>

3
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,160
<i>But from now on,</i>
<i>I promise I won't do it again.</i>

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>Your father's muscular heart disease</i>

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,080
<i>has been getting worse, and right now,</i>

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>it's reached a critical stage.</i>

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,520
<i>I can help you.</i>

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,080
It's just that… you'll have to marry me.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>I accept your offer.</i>

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,840
<i>But it's only a marriage in name.</i>

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

12
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,000
<i>Agreed.</i>

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,880
<i>Did Ms. Sarah turn you down?</i>

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>Not just turn me down,</i>

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,040
she's marrying Din.

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,600
<i>You brought Eyes to see me,</i>
<i>hoping I'd get distracted.</i>

17
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
<i>So, I showed you</i>

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
<i>it didn't work.</i>

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
Sara and I will never fall apart
over your cheap tricks.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
<i>Please don't take Din's side.</i>

21
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,200
You're the only one I've got left.

22
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
But I'm not taking your side either.

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,960
I told you already.

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't approve of you
using that woman as a tool.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,200
But Eyes, she…

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
I came to see you because of Din.

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
He used Ms. Sarah to get at me.

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,320
But they're actually getting married.

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,160
That's part of Din's plan.

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Even though I don't have solid proof yet

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,320
why Ms. Sarah agreed
to marry him so easily,

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll never let him ruin her life.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,920
You really think
Din doesn't love Ms. Sarah?

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,360
He's my brother. Of course, I know him.

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,680
What's wrong with you?
Why did you call so early this morning?

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Has the gift set sample arrived yet?

37
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
Changing the subject, huh?

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm not changing the subject.

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,760
It's work hours now,

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,160
so it's right we talk about work.

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,280
I've told you many times already.

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
It's arrived, sir.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,959
We're looking for a test group.

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
Then we'll evaluate and decide…

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,360
EYES

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
Hello?

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
<i>Din.</i>

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Are you free today?

49
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

50
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,880
<i>Can you come to my condo?</i>

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,480
If you're not comfortable,
we can meet somewhere else.

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm busy. I have work.

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,040
Okay. I understand.

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
Sorry for bothering you.

55
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,920
Was that a work call just now?

56
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,200
Well, you're the one who keeps saying,

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,800
"Work hours are for work."

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
Ms. Eyes called, didn't she?
No need to act cool.

59
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,280
Our wedding is just
a business arrangement anyway.

60
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
Who am I to blame you?

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,560
You should get back to work.

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,200
Suit yourself.

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,680
But my offer still stands.

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Call off the wedding.

65
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,840
Let me pay for Dad's treatment
in installments.

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Then you can go back to your ex
or date whoever you want.

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,200
At least we won't have
to keep pretending like this.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
What the hell did I just say?

69
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
What are you doing?

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,720
Come with me.

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,720
To where? Hey!

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Didn't you just tell me to get
back to work? What's your deal?

73
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,920
Hey! I'm supposed to meet with Toy!

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm giving him
the gift set samples for testing.

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,040
You dragging me off like this,
I'm gonna be late.

76
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,920
Stop complaining already.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Let's just get this over with.

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,200
Get what over with? I've been asking
the whole way and you won't tell me.

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
This is Eyes's condo.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,960
And?

81
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,840
She called and asked me to come.
Not sure what about.

82
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,800
So, I brought you along.

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,640
I'll just tell her straight up
that we're getting married.

84
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
-What?
-Twice.

85
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,760
You've used me twice today already.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
If you're trying to move on, why can't you
do it yourself? Why drag me into it?

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay, I'm sorry.

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,480
Fine, I admit it.

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,880
I didn't dare tell her myself.
Just help me out this once, please.

90
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
When the company makes a profit,

91
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,800
you owe me a bonus. Deal?

92
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Greedy.

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
Deal or not?

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,440
Okay, deal.

95
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Eyes.

96
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
Eyes, I'm coming in.

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Eyes?

98
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,080
Eyes! Eyes!

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
Eyes! Eyes! Eyes.

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Eyes!

101
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,200
Eyes! Eyes!

102
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,360
Eyes!

103
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Eyes! Eyes!

104
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
Hello, please send an ambulance here.

105
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,159
Eyes… Eyes, can you hear me? Eyes?

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
Thank you.

107
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
If you hadn't helped, I wouldn't…

108
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
have known what to do.

109
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
Ms. Eyes has regained consciousness.

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Then… I'll be going now.

111
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Thank you.

112
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Are you a human or the Yellow River?

113
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
You really let your fiancé

114
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,800
stay with his ex?

115
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Did you expect me to make a scene?

116
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,200
"Oh my, Mr. Din, come back right now!

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,840
You can't stay alone together!"

118
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,400
Even saying it out loud
is so damn annoying.

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Alright, you diva.

120
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,320
Less than a month after getting married,

121
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
he started showing his true colors.

122
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,560
I couldn't stand his constant womanizing,

123
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
and we ended up divorced.

124
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
But I didn't want to come back
to Thailand. It felt like failure.

125
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
So, you started a business there.

126
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,440
After the divorce, I got a chunk of money.

127
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,560
But I wasn't smart with it,
and it ran out.

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Then I fell into informal debt.

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,520
That's why I had to come back here, Din.

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,400
I really messed up, didn't I?
Repeating the same mistakes?

131
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,520
Eyes…

132
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,360
Listen to me.

133
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
People who work

134
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,560
make mistakes.

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,040
The only ones who never do

136
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
are the ones who never try anything.

137
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,760
What matters

138
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,880
is what happens next,

139
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,160
what you'll do from here.

140
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,720
I really don't know, Din.

141
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
Um…

142
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,320
Wait, wait, hold on.

143
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
-Yes?
-Sarach, try this pose.

144
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,560
One hand at the nape,
the other in your pocket.

145
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,600
Nice, change it up a bit.

146
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
Ah, like that, yes!

147
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
Wow, so handsome.

148
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,960
Looking great.

149
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,720
Oh my God.

150
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,840
Thank you. I'll head off now.

151
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,200
Where are you rushing off to, Sarach?

152
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,920
Come to a party with me first.

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,240
Your makeup and hair look good today.

154
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,400
Trust me. This place will be fun.

155
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,960
Sorry, I have to see
my dad at the hospital.

156
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,320
Thank you so much
for giving me this opportunity.

157
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,360
Mhm.

158
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,680
I already sent the photos.

159
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
Boss.

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,560
Got a new boy to introduce.

161
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
He's fresh and looks great.

162
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,600
I'll send you the pics.

163
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,400
Okay, thanks.

164
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Where are you headed?

165
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,280
Mmm.

166
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,680
You actually eat street food like this?

167
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,720
I thought you only went
to thousand-baht-a-meal mall restaurants.

168
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,360
Sorry, I look so tasteful,
you got the wrong idea.

169
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
I've got good taste.

170
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,600
But honestly, I can eat street food too.

171
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,880
You've been staring
at me forever. What's up?

172
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,640
Well, I just came to warn you. Be careful.

173
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,280
The person who asked you
to work with him isn't exactly clean.

174
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,320
Oh, Pong?

175
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,680
What's wrong with him?

176
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,120
He's…

177
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,480
kind of a scammer.

178
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,480
I don't think he is.

179
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,160
Because after the job,
he transferred the pay right away

180
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
and didn't take a commission.

181
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
Whatever.

182
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,240
Consider this my warning.

183
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Oh,

184
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,440
and thanks for the noodles.

185
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
No problem.

186
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,080
I just don't like owing people favors.

187
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,320
Like my dad owing your family.

188
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
Have some soy milk.

189
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,920
If you drink coffee now, you won't sleep.

190
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,080
Thanks.

191
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,960
What made you come see me?

192
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,160
I needed someone to hear me out.

193
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
And I couldn't think of anyone but you.

194
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,520
Should I be happy about that?

195
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,640
That you think of me
when you have problems?

196
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,240
I think so.

197
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Not everyone
would get me to open up like that.

198
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,800
How much personal money
do you have left right now?

199
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,000
Not enough to help Eyes.

200
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,440
Because you already helped my dad.

201
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,560
But actually,

202
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,160
I do have another way to help her.

203
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,400
It's just…

204
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,520
I don't want to choose that way.

205
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,440
Then let me rephrase.

206
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,360
Between helping Ms. Eyes and not helping,

207
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,720
which would make you feel worse afterward?

208
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,720
That's something
you have to decide for yourself.

209
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,320
I can't make that call for you.

210
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,520
There is only one thing I can do.

211
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,480
What is it?

212
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll stand by your side.

213
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,080
No matter which choice you make,

214
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,000
or whatever comes from it,

215
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,680
I promise

216
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
I will be by your side.

217
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
Yes, Pong?

218
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,800
Right now?

219
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
Yes, I'm free.

220
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,560
Okay, I'll head out now. See you there.

221
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,560
-Hello, Pong.
-Hi.

222
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm so sorry. This is so urgent.

223
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
No worries.

224
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,120
Go get changed. I've left clothes
in the dressing room.

225
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay, I'll change now.

226
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Alright.

227
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,080
I transferred the money to you, Sarach.

228
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,840
Yes, thank you, Pong.

229
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,200
Why are you rushing home?

230
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,160
Come hang out with me first.

231
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm not available.

232
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,160
Not available?

233
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
You can come with me willingly,

234
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
or I'll make you come.

235
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,200
Make me?

236
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
Hey!

237
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,360
Let go!

238
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,480
How can you do this? It's illegal.

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,440
Why can't I?

240
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,840
You did everything yourself in this clip.

241
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,680
Where's the part where I forced you?

242
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,240
Gross.

243
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,040
Don't get mouthy with me.

244
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,040
If you go meet the client
properly with me,

245
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
you'll get paid well.

246
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,560
And maybe I'll even
be kind enough to delete this clip.

247
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,880
Well?

248
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,040
-Hm?
-Yeah.

249
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,920
Huh? What?

250
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Police!

251
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,800
What?

252
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,560
Take him!

253
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,560
-Go, go.
-Let me go!

254
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Yo.

255
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,880
I never thought he'd be that rotten.

256
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
Too bad he escaped.

257
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,880
He won't be free for long.

258
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,360
And you. Before you accept work,
do some background checks.

259
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,920
Is it that easy to check?

260
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,200
It's not.

261
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
But if you try, you can find something.

262
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,280
Otherwise, how could I help you?

263
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,200
Oh, you there!

264
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
Yes, you.

265
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,480
Well… Hello.

266
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,240
I run a modeling agency
and recruit talent.

267
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,960
Here's my card.
Contact me if you're interested.

268
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,040
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

269
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Alright, caught a new prospect.

270
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
"Scammer playing modeling agent

271
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,640
with name starting with P.

272
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
Always uses photo shoots as an excuse,

273
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
but really, it's a trafficking ring."

274
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Once I was sure Pong was one of them,

275
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
I went to the police.

276
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,080
Luckily, they had leads.

277
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,320
How did you know I had work today?

278
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
You seemed so confident
he wouldn't scam you,

279
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
so I thought
you might continue to take the gig.

280
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,760
I told the cops to tail you.

281
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,200
Luckily, they followed you
from the university.

282
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
They caught him red-handed.

283
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,560
Hey, I need to ask you something.

284
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
What is it?

285
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,960
Please don't tell my sister about today.

286
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,800
I don't want her to worry.

287
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
-About Dad alone--
-Don't worry.

288
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,480
It won't slip from my mouth.

289
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,720
Promise?

290
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,680
-If my sister finds out, I'll kill you.
-Got it.

291
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,040
You're the only one I'd do this for.

292
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,160
Slowly.

293
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't forget to take your meds, okay?

294
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
Okay.

295
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
Din.

296
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,080
You transferred me this money?

297
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
It's company money.
I don't have that much myself.

298
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,720
So, won't that get you in trouble?

299
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,160
Don't worry.

300
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,280
I can handle it.

301
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Thank you so much, Din.

302
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,480
When I have no one left,

303
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,360
you still won't abandon me.

304
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,360
How could I ever abandon you?

305
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,160
No matter what happens,

306
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
we'll always be friends.

307
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
I'll head back now,

308
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
so you can get some rest.

309
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
No Chef's Table, really?

310
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
You want it?
How many chefs, how many tables?

311
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,000
Bring all the chefs. Chef-palooza!

312
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,400
Oh, Mr. Nam.

313
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,200
Mr. Toy, why are you here?

314
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,760
He's here as a test subject
for the sample.

315
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,840
Want to grab lunch together?

316
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,040
But it's the canteen,

317
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,320
not the lethal mortar-and-pestle
papaya salad again.

318
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,680
It's fine. I'm swamped with work.

319
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,560
Aren't you taking a lunch break?

320
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,480
I want to prove
I can work as well as anyone,

321
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,120
and that I'm reliable.

322
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,920
Excuse me.

323
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,240
Yes.

324
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,520
Why did Mr. Apo say that?

325
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,000
Like he just can't let go.

326
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,640
You're about to marry
his brother, you know.

327
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Exactly, headache material.

328
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Let's go.

329
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,720
Really? The canteen? For real?

330
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,600
Din.

331
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,320
I'm sorry for everything.

332
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
Forget it, Eyes.

333
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,400
It's in the past.

334
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
No, Din. I still have to apologize.

335
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm sorry, Din.

336
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,240
I'm sorry.

337
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm really sorry.

338
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,000
Don't blame yourself.

339
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,240
Up until now,

340
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,240
I've never been angry at you.

341
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,280
Wow.

342
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,440
I don't have that kind of money.

343
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,840
But Din probably does.

344
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,040
Why don't you try asking him?

345
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
I wouldn't dare to.

346
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,320
You know what I did to him.

347
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,640
Come on. Din's not the vindictive type.

348
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,840
Since the breakup,

349
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,720
he's just been working, not seeing anyone.

350
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,400
I think…

351
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,480
Din hasn't forgotten you.

352
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,520
Is this because I'm a widow?

353
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,040
It's not like that, Eyes.

354
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,480
-If it's not, then why?
-I'm getting married.

355
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Din.

356
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,000
Mom, is something wrong?

357
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,360
Accounting called and told me

358
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,400
you withdrew two million
from the company advance funds.

359
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,680
What did you use it for?

360
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,440
You used the advance
to help your ex pay her debts?

361
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,240
Are you out of your mind?

362
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm really sorry

363
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
I messed with company funds.

364
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,160
But I already spent my personal money
helping Uncle Suthee. It was necessary.

365
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,640
So, you're saying
I forced you into this? Huh?

366
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,040
I didn't think that. You know that.

367
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
Let's just say,

368
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll return the company money
as fast as I can.

369
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,040
How fast is "as fast as you can"?

370
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,880
Shareholders' meeting is in a few days.

371
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
Even if this money
was within your authority to use,

372
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
if you used it for personal reasons,
you're done.

373
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,760
Company account data is internal.

374
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,960
No one outside will find out.

375
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,520
Good. Confidence is one thing.

376
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,880
But if something happens,
don't come asking for help.

377
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,680
Can Din be that stupid?

378
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,400
Well, that helps. Thanks for the tip.

379
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,360
Bitcoin up? Look at that grin.

380
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,000
No.

381
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,440
I just have something fun to do.

382
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,480
Din.

383
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,760
He signed a company advance

384
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,640
to help pay off his ex's debts.

385
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,720
Eyes?

386
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,120
That old flame

387
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,120
will finish him off this time.

388
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,560
Just wait and see.

389
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Dad.

390
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,720
Why didn't you tell me
Dad moved back to a regular ward?

391
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
So that you could skip class?

392
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,000
You'll see when you get here.

393
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,080
Dad moved sooner than the doctor expected.

394
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,560
If this keeps up,
you might be allowed home in a few days.

395
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,800
I also want to go home.
I'm sick of the hospital already.

396
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,400
Uncle, I brought a gift basket to visit.

397
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,320
Thank you, Mr. Din.

398
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,880
I'll step outside for a bit,
so you two can talk properly.

399
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,880
Uncle.

400
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,920
I have something I need to tell you.

401
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Why so formal all of a sudden?

402
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,800
Well…

403
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,320
Sara and I…

404
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,480
We're getting married.

405
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,159
What's up?

406
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,159
<i>Yeah, hello, Rach?</i>

407
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,400
Did you take my lecture notes?
I can't find them anywhere.

408
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,199
Oh, really?

409
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,840
Can you look for it too?

410
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,120
So I can stop looking.
I've searched everywhere.

411
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,239
Okay, hang on. I'll call you back.

412
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Please look after my daughter.

413
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm really happy

414
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,320
that our families
are like one sheet of gold.

415
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,639
"One sheet of gold?"
What do you mean, Dad?

416
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,600
Come on.

417
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,120
What else would it mean?

418
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,480
It means Din and your sister
are going to get married.

419
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,480
You said Din lent you money
for Dad's treatment,

420
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,240
so how did a wedding
happen all of a sudden?

421
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,160
Did you force her to marry you?

422
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
Why are you so quiet? Say something.

423
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,360
You're the one who should be quiet!

424
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Don't get aggressive
with elders like that! I--

425
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,440
-Dad!
-Uncle!

426
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,760
Dad.

427
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
Sarach.

428
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
I'll go after him.

429
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,440
Sarach.

430
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,200
Sarach.

431
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,240
Sarach, wait.

432
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,680
Sarach, wait. Listen to me first.

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,120
What excuse are you going to give?

434
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,960
Yes, I lent her money.

435
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,320
But I didn't force your sister
to marry me.

436
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,640
Our families have always been close.

437
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,880
But you've always taken advantage of us.

438
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,000
Now you're using money
to make my sister marry you?

439
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,240
What will come next?

440
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,880
So, how about this?

441
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,440
Let time be the proof

442
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,640
that I didn't force Sara.

443
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,000
If you didn't force her, then you and Sara
must really love each other, huh?

444
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,000
<i>Hello.</i>

445
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
<i>Hello.</i>

446
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,560
-Hello. Please come in.
-Hello. Please.

447
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,960
-Hello. Please come in.
-Hello. I'll show you the way.

448
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,080
Thanks for telling me to talk to Din.

449
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,920
At first, I was hesitant.

450
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,760
It's okay.

451
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,240
We're all friends here.

452
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,200
If Din hadn't helped,
I might not have made it.

453
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Anyway, thanks again, Nam.

454
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,400
And thank you

455
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,600
for keeping my debt situation quiet.

456
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm not one for gossip.

457
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,160
Congrats on clearing your debt.

458
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,400
More like I changed creditors.

459
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,880
At least a familiar face
puts less pressure on me.

460
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,360
I'll still have to get the money
to clear Din's debt.

461
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,200
I already told you

462
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,600
that Din

463
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,160
hasn't forgotten you.

464
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,880
If he hadn't forgotten,
he wouldn't be getting married.

465
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,440
Din said you know
the person he's marrying.

466
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
From last quarter's results,

467
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,520
we recorded only a slight loss
from investing in a new product.

468
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,960
Does anyone want more details?

469
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,440
Mr. Chakrit.

470
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,760
What question do you have?

471
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,080
Here you go.

472
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,640
Please take a look.

473
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,080
The documents in everyone's hands
are evidence

474
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,280
of suspicious activity by the CEO.

475
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,920
Now you've seen
that Mr. Pathawee used his authority

476
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,280
to transfer company advance funds

477
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,120
to an outside individual.

478
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,720
And we heard

479
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,840
the recipient was his ex-girlfriend.

480
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,120
Hey, live from the boardroom.
It's intense.

481
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Mr. Chakrit picked up

482
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,760
that Mr. Pathawee used
company funds for personal matters.

483
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,800
Whoa, seriously?

484
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Could that be true?

485
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,680
Seems unlikely.

486
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,560
So…

487
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,520
Mr. Pathawee,
is what Mr. Chakrit said true?

488
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,360
Two million

489
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,600
was within the CEO's authority.

490
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
But it's still wrong.

491
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,280
As an executive,

492
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,880
you should be transparent, shouldn't you?

493
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,240
I admit it.

494
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,120
I did use company money

495
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,240
for personal reasons.

496
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,040
Now I hate my claustrophobia the most.

497
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,960
I couln't even use the elevator!

498
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,320
See?

499
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,960
He's already admitted it himself.

500
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,800
So, he must take responsibility
by resigning from his position.

501
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,040
Isn't that right, Mr. Pathawee?

502
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,960
<i>I'll beat you</i>

503
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,080
<i>the right way.</i>

504
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,680
And I'll make Ms. Sarah see my worth.

505
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,160
<i>If Nam says he won't give up on Ms. Sarah,</i>

506
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,400
then I won't give up on you either.

507
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,320
Is this Sarach's?

508
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,880
Yes. He was so upset,
he forgot to grab it all.

509
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
<i>Call him right now and tell him.</i>

510
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,600
-Pong?
-You called the cops on me, didn't you?

511
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,600
Beat him up.

512
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,880
