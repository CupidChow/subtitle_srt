1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,000
<i>You know someone's eyeing your position.</i>

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
Be more careful with what you do.

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,800
<i>It's not that I don't care for you.</i>

4
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,720
<i>But I see you like a little sister.</i>

5
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,240
<i>I really can't think of you any other way.</i>

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,360
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>you can't beat my brother's game.</i>

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>Whether it's true or not, I don't care.</i>

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
<i>But the fact that he got hurt</i>
<i>because of my brother, that's real.</i>

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,280
And that's enough for me.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,120
<i>Even after announcing</i>
<i>the wedding, it's still chaos.</i>

11
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
You've got to do something about it.

12
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
There's probably only one way left.

13
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,520
You're drenched in sweat!

14
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,120
What on earth were you doing?
I almost fell flat on my face!

15
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,680
Hey, are you training
for the world championship or something?

16
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
I wanna just crash when I get home,

17
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,720
so I don't lie awake overthinking.

18
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,120
You're beyond help.

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,320
Are you saying I should just give up?

20
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
No, but if you're not giving up,

21
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,200
then neither am I.

22
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,400
Here.

23
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,600
But I'm not running around
like a maniac like you.

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
Sweating ruins the beauty, you know.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Hey, who said that?

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
Nice save.

27
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,240
No.

28
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,920
I mean, whether you run or not,
it makes no difference anyway.

29
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,400
- Nam!
- Missed!

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,840
- Nam!
- Missed! Careful!

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,640
- Nam, you big-mouthed jerk!
- Still missed!

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,000
I've sent the feedback to the factory
with everyone's comments included.

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,560
They promised production will finish

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
right on schedule.

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,160
As for the marketing plan
the team proposed,

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,120
I have no objections. Go ahead as planned.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,320
Hey, are you free this afternoon?
I want to take you somewhere.

38
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,160
Is this business or personal?

39
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,400
I don't want my boss scolding me.

40
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,720
Someone actually dares scold you?

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,519
Want me to handle it?
I could tell him to shut up for good.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Mmm, sure.

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Go hard on him.
I've been annoyed for ages.

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,400
Nah,

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,040
I'd feel bad.
He just got punched, remember?

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
Not that tough then.

47
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
So, where exactly are you taking me?

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Why did you bring me to your house?

49
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,560
You said we had errands to run.

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,520
We're reminiscing.

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
You used to live here for years.

52
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,920
Don't look so confused.

53
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Come with me.

54
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,920
Do you remember

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,360
that time Nam broke the vase and ran off?

56
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,400
You showed up right then
and took the blame for him.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,920
Of course, I remember.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
That vase of Uncle Tesho's was expensive.

59
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,160
But actually…

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,120
I didn't just show up by accident.

61
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,280
I saw Mr. Nam break it,
so I took the blame for him.

62
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,560
I thought I'd just get scolded.

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,840
If I'd known how valuable it was,
I'd have stayed quiet.

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
That means

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,640
you were kind to Nam even back then.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
I just wanted a friend.

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
When I was a kid, I didn't have anyone.

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,000
Mr. Nam and I were the same age,

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
in the same class,

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
living under the same roof, so…

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
I wanted to be friends with him.

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,960
If back then,

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Nam had agreed to be your friend,

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
things might've turned out differently.

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,320
But we can't turn back time.

76
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
So…

77
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
I stopped thinking about that long ago.

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
Recognize this room?

79
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,160
Yes.

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
It was my bedroom.

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
You're stunned by nostalgia, huh?

82
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Come on.

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,280
Hello.

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Heard the car ages ago, but you two
took forever. What were you doing?

85
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,560
Just showing her around,
a little memory tour.

86
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,560
Good.

87
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Now she'll know what's where,
and more importantly,

88
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,360
who's who.

89
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,600
When will you deal with this?

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
Next week.

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,760
Aren't you going to tell me
what you two were just talking about?

92
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Well?

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
What's happening next week?

94
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,320
What are those two doing?

95
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,640
A battle for the rice ladle, maybe.
Whoever scoops first gets the merit.

96
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,920
Not quite.

97
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
The elders say

98
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,080
between the bride and groom,

99
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,520
whoever holds their ladle higher

100
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
will be the one who leads.

101
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Folks,

102
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,240
I suggest you both hold the ladle together

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,760
and scoop at the same time.

104
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,120
That way, no one's above the other.

105
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,640
Otherwise, I might never
get back to the temple today.

106
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,120
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE RECORD

107
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

108
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,360
All set, sir?

109
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
All good.

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
Tell the driver to take
the director back to his office.

111
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,040
Yes, Mr. Din.

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
- I'll take my leave.
- Thank you.

113
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Goodbye.

114
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,640
That's it for me. I'm heading out.

115
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Uh…

116
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,680
Um…

117
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
Let your uncle… Oh, wait.

118
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,760
I shouldn't call myself "uncle".

119
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,240
Let your father take this role for you.

120
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
May you both

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,920
have a blessed marriage,

122
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,880
a life filled
with good fortune and harmony.

123
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,120
Just seeing their faces drives me crazy.

124
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,480
Now I have to live
under the same roof as them.

125
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,040
Dreaming of auspicious things

126
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,720
must be a sign something good is coming.

127
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,760
Here, Dad.

128
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,240
What is he doing?

129
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,560
It's called the "bed-setting ceremony".

130
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,960
It blesses the newlyweds, so they'll
stay together for a long, long time.

131
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,600
Though this isn't the full version,
the real one has way too many props.

132
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Come.

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
May you both

134
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,000
live happily together.

135
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,040
And don't be stubborn, don't argue,

136
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,560
don't give your husband such a hard time.

137
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
Dad, I'm your daughter!

138
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,080
Din…

139
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,840
You're now my son too.

140
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,040
Take good care of her for me.

141
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
Whatever happens,

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
talk it out.

143
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
Yes.

144
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,400
If Tesho

145
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
and your mother were still here,

146
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,680
they'd be so happy right now.

147
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,520
What are you doing?

148
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm packing to sleep in another room.

149
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
No.

150
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,880
We agreed we'd sleep separately.

151
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,800
- Move.
- No.

152
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,080
What? Why not?

153
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,280
Even if we're married on paper
and you've moved in,

154
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
right now,

155
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,440
Nam is watching us closely.
You can't make him suspicious.

156
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,360
Meaning…

157
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
No way.

158
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,080
There's no way I'm sleeping
in the same room as you.

159
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,760
If you have another option, say it.

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
I don't.

161
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
But a promise is a promise.

162
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,720
You're breaking your word on day one?

163
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,160
I promised not to cross any lines.

164
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,400
Sharing a room doesn't mean I will.

165
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,440
But I don't trust you.

166
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
You're still staying.

167
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,960
I won't let you ruin my plan.

168
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Nina!

169
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,720
Nina!

170
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,200
- Fabulous, babe.
- Long time no see.

171
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,320
How are you?

172
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm good. Did you wait long?

173
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,360
Not at all. What can I get you today?

174
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,200
Same as always.

175
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
Coming right up.
Tonight we're going all out.

176
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,600
We're not going home sober!

177
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,640
- For our gorgeous lady, here you go.
- Thank you!

178
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,960
Be right back, girls.

179
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,440
Where are you going?

180
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,160
You just got here.

181
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,680
I found a man.

182
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Oh my God.

183
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,520
If you don't want company, just say it.

184
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,560
No need to chase me away.
No need to leave.

185
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,800
I have pride too, you know.

186
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,160
How strange.

187
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,680
I've never seen you drink alone like this.

188
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
Drop the act.

189
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,840
You know what happened.

190
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
Not drinking would be strange.

191
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Want to vent to me?

192
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,960
I promise

193
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
I'll be a very good listener.

194
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,280
I don't believe
Din and Ms. Sarah love each other.

195
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
There has to be more to it.

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,160
Think about it, Nina.

197
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,359
They signed the marriage papers,

198
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,000
had the ceremony at home today,

199
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,359
And from now on,

200
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,359
I have to look at the woman I love
as my sister-in-law.

201
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,520
- Damn you, Din! You jerk!
- Careful.

202
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
You suck! You selfish bastard!

203
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
Watch your step. Slowly. Careful.

204
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,480
Careful. One step at a time.

205
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
You can yell in the car later, okay?

206
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,640
Watch your step. Careful.

207
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
No, no, I can get in the car myself.

208
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,120
Alright.

209
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,680
Get in then. No! Watch your head.

210
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Easy. Watch your head.

211
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
I'm exhausted.

212
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,440
You don't love me? Fine.

213
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,600
But marrying my brother?

214
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,680
Seriously?

215
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,760
Sarah…

216
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Sarah!

217
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,640
Seat belt, please.

218
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,680
Tonight…
I'll make you forget all about it.

219
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,920
Hey, hey!

220
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
Go that way! That way!

221
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
Out! Go!

222
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
Killed the mood!

223
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,920
Hey! Mr. Din!

224
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,360
What are you doing? I'm not playing.

225
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,000
Do you really think

226
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,400
those pillows and blankets

227
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,000
will actually keep me away?

228
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
If I wanted to do anything to you,

229
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,760
I would've done it long ago.

230
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,720
There!

231
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,600
Stop being ridiculous
and go to sleep already.

232
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
Hey, hey, what are you doing now?

233
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't follow me.

234
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Sarah…

235
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Fine. A little uncomfortable,

236
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
but at least it's safe.

237
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,240
Hey.

238
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,440
Hey, come out.

239
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,880
I was teasing you.
I'll sleep on the floor.

240
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
I don't believe you.

241
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,680
You're sleeping in the bathroom.

242
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,120
That's uncomfortable.
Can you even sleep like that?

243
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,160
And what if I want to use the bathroom?

244
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,520
Then use another one. Your house is huge.

245
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,440
If you want to make your life hard,

246
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
suit yourself.

247
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,640
What am I even doing here?

248
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,600
I wanna cry.

249
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

250
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,920
I should be the one apologizing
for coming so late.

251
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,920
Here's this month's interest, as agreed.

252
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,120
And I have good news.

253
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,520
About Din's wedding?

254
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,200
Oh, you already know?

255
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,800
Let's just say I've removed
that thorn from your heart.

256
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,040
I'd like to invite Mr. Praphop
to invest in the project--

257
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,440
Din's wedding is one thing.

258
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,000
Investment is another.

259
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,000
But Nina…

260
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,920
You could talk to your father
for me, like always.

261
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,960
If you want me to beg Father,

262
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,160
shouldn't I at least be
somewhat certain of a few things?

263
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,920
If he invests,

264
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,560
and I get nothing in return,

265
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,440
I'd be at a huge disadvantage.

266
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,840
Hm…

267
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,280
I've done everything I can on my end.

268
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,160
Beyond that,

269
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm powerless to control Nam.

270
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,160
Then, I guess

271
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,560
you already have your answer.

272
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
I won't be sending you off, okay?

273
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,240
Ow…

274
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,240
Ugh.

275
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
My whole body aches.

276
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,040
Hey, hey, what?!

277
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,840
You jerk! You bastard!

278
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,560
- You liar!
- Hey, wait!

279
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,200
Wait, stop! Slow down!

280
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,880
Think.

281
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,280
You got into the bed yourself.

282
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,440
I built the Great Wall between us.

283
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,640
You're the one who took advantage.

284
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,280
You molested--

285
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
When I woke up,

286
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,800
you were hugging me on the bed.

287
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,720
I tried to pull your hands off,
but you wouldn't let go.

288
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,960
And you wrapped your leg around me,
so I couldn't even move.

289
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,560
I had to let you cling to me all night
until my whole body's sore.

290
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,120
You…

291
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,880
You're serious?

292
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,320
Hey. Can you check my rib here?

293
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
What happened?

294
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,200
I don't know. It just hurts.

295
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,200
Not sure if it's cracked or bruised.

296
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,560
What did you bump into?

297
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,720
Feels like…

298
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,600
a massive, heavy leg was crushing me.

299
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
Hey, watch your mouth.

300
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
My legs are slim and tiny.

301
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Pretty sure what I remember
was thick and heavy.

302
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,080
Thick and heavy, huh?

303
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,720
Ouch, hey! That hurts!

304
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
That's what you get for talking trash.

305
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
You're body-shaming, you know.

306
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,800
Okay, okay, I was joking.
I won't say it again.

307
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,120
Nam, get up.

308
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
Get up right now, Nam.

309
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,600
Nam. Up.

310
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
Why are you sleeping down here?

311
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,520
Nam. Ugh, you reek of alcohol.

312
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
Did you drink it or bathe in it?

313
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,560
- Nam, you can't sleep here, honey.
- Mom.

314
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,400
- Let me help.
- Yeah, okay.

315
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
Nam.

316
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,320
Nam.

317
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,920
Nam.

318
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,160
- Get up.
- Here, I'll help.

319
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
- Let go.
- Huh? Oh.

320
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,080
- Nam.
- Nam… Hey.

321
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh dear! Nam!

322
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Nam!

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,600
Oh dear. Nam.

324
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,640
Slowly. Get up slowly.

325
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,120
Come on. Let's go.

326
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,480
Walk with me. Slowly now.

327
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,440
Yes, that's it…

328
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,880
Straight ahead… Slowly…

329
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,040
I told you this wouldn't work.

330
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,400
See? Mr. Nam's even worse now.

331
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,120
I thought he was just obsessed
with you and he'd get over it.

332
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Who knew he'd fall apart like this?

333
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,920
You think you understand your brother,

334
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,560
but the truth is,

335
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,520
you've never understood him at all.

336
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,760
Fine. I admit it.

337
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,240
But even if I understand, I won't give…

338
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Give what?

339
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
Mr. Din, we have a big issue.

340
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
So, this is your wife, Din?

341
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,840
Sorry I didn't send a gift
for the wedding.

342
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,880
It's completely fine.

343
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
It was just a small ceremony.

344
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,040
So pretty…

345
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,280
Just like Nina described.

346
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,280
Thank you very much, sir.

347
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,760
Call us Uncle and Aunt.

348
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,400
We're no strangers anymore, right?

349
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,480
Thank you.

350
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,600
I'll head back to work then.

351
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, dear.

352
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,720
For you to come see me yourself,

353
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,840
this must be important, Uncle.

354
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,720
Well, you could say that.

355
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,960
It's been quite some time already.

356
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,760
I'd like to have my principal back.

357
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,480
My mom gave you
the interest yesterday, didn't she?

358
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
We don't want

359
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,920
just the interest anymore.

360
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,280
We want the principal back.

361
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,360
I have several investments lined up.

362
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,680
I thought it's more worthwhile
to get my money back

363
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
than to keep waiting
for interest from you.

364
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,800
You understand, right?

365
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,320
I understand.

366
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,760
But right now, my company

367
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
still needs working capital.

368
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,160
If I return the money now,
I'll lose liquidity.

369
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,560
Uncle…

370
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,360
Could you give me a little more time?

371
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,520
Uh…

372
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,680
Then how about this?

373
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,120
If I ask for a seat on the board,

374
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,440
what will you say, Din?

375
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
Uh…

376
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,600
What do you mean, Uncle?
I'm not really following.

377
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,720
I simply want to help manage the company.

378
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
If the company makes more profit,

379
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,160
you'll be able to pay me back faster.

380
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,080
Alright.

381
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,600
But…

382
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,600
wouldn't a board committee role
be too small for you, Uncle?

383
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,440
It's not for me.

384
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm busy with politics. I won't have time.

385
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,240
Then…

386
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,280
who do you want on the board?

387
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,880
Someone I trust.

388
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,480
<i>If it's anyone else, I won't complain.</i>

389
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,720
But I'm never working
with someone like Chakrit.

390
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
Why not?

391
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,680
Even though Chakrit

392
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,960
doesn't have management experience,

393
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,840
he's no ordinary kid.

394
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,680
He's one of the rising stars
in business right now.

395
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,480
He doesn't have
PD's best interests at heart.

396
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,480
And the reason I'm in debt

397
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,720
and needed your money,
part of it came from his father.

398
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Din, you need to separate business
from personal matters.

399
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
I think

400
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,040
Chakrit is professional enough.

401
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,680
He won't harm the company.

402
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,560
And besides,
he owns this company's shares.

403
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,080
How could he not wish the company well?

404
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,920
Please, this way.

405
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
This will be your office, Mr. Chakrit.

406
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,280
If you need anything else,
please let me know.

407
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,800
Hey, wait.

408
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Come here.

409
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Who are you calling?

410
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,120
You. Come here.

411
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,360
I don't like this room.

412
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,679
I want… a bigger one.

413
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,040
A corner office

414
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,560
would be even better.

415
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,600
I want a view that's easy on the eyes.

416
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,880
If you want a new office, sir,
it'll take two or three days to prepare.

417
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,640
I want it now.

418
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,800
Father, why would you do this?

419
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,560
Now it'll be even harder
for me and Nam to get along.

420
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,720
Why didn't you talk to me first?

421
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,000
Still hoping?

422
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,720
If he wanted you,
he would've chosen you a long time ago.

423
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Stop obsessing over men

424
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,280
and start thinking
about your own benefits.

425
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,520
I don't dislike Nam.

426
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,440
He's a good kid.

427
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,400
But I don't have the luxury
to wait for him for years like you do.

428
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,200
None of you understand me.

429
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,080
I like Nam.

430
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,360
I like that he's the only guy
who ever rejected me.

431
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,200
Honestly,

432
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,720
I don't want to lose to someone like that.

433
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,720
I want him at my feet.

434
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,920
But he doesn't care
about the company at all.

435
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,040
We've pressured him in every way,
and he still doesn't care.

436
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,280
You want us to take losses

437
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,920
and get nothing back?

438
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,120
PD is actually a solid company.

439
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,920
It just has cashflow problems.

440
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,080
If we inject some money
and get liquidity back,

441
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,040
I think it'll recover for sure.

442
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,400
And all the benefits

443
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
will go back to you.

444
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,120
Whatever you two decide.

445
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,720
Chakrit, I'm counting on you.

446
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,200
Don't worry, sir.

447
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,480
But please don't forget our deal.

448
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,560
If I succeed,

449
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,480
I get Din's position.

450
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,840
That depends on your ability.

451
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,400
<i>Uncle Perm, what's going on?</i>

452
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,320
Mr. Chakrit ordered
the whole staff to be fired.

453
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,000
He fired the staff?

454
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,640
This is your management?

455
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,680
No wonder the company would collapse.

456
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,320
<i>Why not try again?</i>
<i>Prove yourself to Ms. Sarah.</i>

457
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,360
<i>Show her you have value.</i>
<i>Show her you can protect her.</i>

458
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,600
<i>I want to know.</i>

459
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,360
If this project gets launched

460
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,080
and ends up being a loss,

461
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,040
who exactly will take responsibility?

462
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,040
I'll resign as CEO.

463
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,240
