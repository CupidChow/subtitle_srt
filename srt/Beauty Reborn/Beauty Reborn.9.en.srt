1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>What gives you the right</i>
<i>to fire my employees however you please?</i>

2
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,760
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>who gave me full authority</i>

3
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
to make decisions in this company.

4
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
<i>Didn't you say Din would be out by now?!</i>

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,040
<i>I didn't think he'd flip the game</i>
<i>and turn sales around like that.</i>

6
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,000
Stop wasting time with excuses.

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,560
Just kick him out directly.

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm so happy!

9
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Hey, hey, careful.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
You're drunk. You're gonna fall.

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm not.

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
If you don't believe me,

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
look at me up close.

14
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,120
If you're going to bed,
I'll turn off the lights.

15
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,480
You're not sleeping?

16
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,080
I still have work to finish.

17
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
Then I'll get back to it.

18
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,760
What do I do now?

19
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,280
Sarah, you idiot.

20
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
What…

21
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,400
What did you do?

22
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,560
I must've been really drunk.

23
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,280
Wait.

24
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,520
Was I that drunk?

25
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Hey. No, no, no.

26
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,520
I was drunk. I was definitely drunk.

27
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,120
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,360
I was drunk. So drunk.
You were drunk, Sarah.

29
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Din.

30
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,200
Din, wake up. It's morning.

31
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Huh?

32
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
Yo?

33
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,160
Why are you sleeping out here?

34
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
And why are you in here?

35
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,160
I came to get something yesterday
and forgot my iPad.

36
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,880
So…

37
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,960
Why are you sleeping here?

38
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,840
Did you fight with your wife

39
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
and get kicked out of the room?

40
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
Am I right?

41
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Of course not.

42
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,360
I was working. There's a lot to do. See?

43
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,440
Today's meeting

44
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,480
is to acknowledge and appreciate

45
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440
the significant rise in sales.

46
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes, our sales

47
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,200
have hit a record high

48
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
and brought hope back to the company.

49
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
Even though sales are good,

50
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,720
I still think this company needs a change

51
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,720
to move in a new direction.

52
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
What do you mean?

53
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,600
I propose we replace the CEO

54
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
to align with the company's new policy.

55
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,920
What gives you the authority to remove me?

56
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,840
If I don't resign,
the shareholders have to vote.

57
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Or do you think

58
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,960
you have enough shares to push me out?

59
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Then take a look for yourself.

60
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,040
Ms. Namnuan

61
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
has sold all her shares

62
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
to Mr. Praphop.

63
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,680
And here's
the shareholder transfer contract.

64
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
PD GROUP SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

65
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
Why would you betray me?

66
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm just looking out for myself.

67
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,520
You never succeed at anything.

68
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
You couldn't even get Nam to marry Nina.

69
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,320
And you run the company terribly.

70
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,760
So, I had to do this.

71
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
But things were finally getting better.

72
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
"Getting better"
doesn't mean they'll stay better.

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Selling the shares
while people still think it has a future

74
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
is better than waiting for the fall.
I won't take that risk.

75
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
How long have you been doing this?

76
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,640
-Doing what?
-Playing both sides.

77
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,160
I've always wondered

78
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
how the words from when
I advanced that money to help Eyes

79
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
got to Chakrit.

80
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,680
I think I know now.

81
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
Hope this helps you.

82
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,480
Do whatever you want with it.
Just make sure

83
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,440
my salary and benefits

84
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,120
stay the same.

85
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
You run the entire accounting department.

86
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Details about money
only leak from one place.

87
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,120
I actually suspected it at first,

88
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,040
but I told myself…

89
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,920
you're my mother,

90
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
and I'm your son.

91
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
Even if you didn't love me
like your real child, I never thought

92
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,080
you'd do this to me.

93
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,960
People have to put themselves first.
That's just how it is.

94
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
Are you okay?

95
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,760
It's alright.

96
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,640
How could you do that to Din?

97
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Don't raise your voice at me.

98
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm only here to tell you

99
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
that you have to vote
for Mr. Praphop's side. That's an order.

100
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,880
So, you actually want Din
out of his position?

101
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,480
Can't be helped. That's their condition.

102
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,760
But he's my brother.

103
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,120
And I'm your real mother.

104
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
I already promised Mr. Praphop.

105
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,920
He'll take care of the debt we owe him,
including my personal debt.

106
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
If I don't do this, I'll get in trouble.
Is that what you want?

107
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,640
<i>That's how it is.</i>

108
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,040
All I can do is listen.
The decision is yours.

109
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Just having someone to talk to
makes me feel a lot better already.

110
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,640
Right now, I feel like I'm on my own.

111
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,680
One side is my brother.
The other side is my mother.

112
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know who to choose.

113
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,520
You're not alone.
I told you I'm here to listen.

114
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,800
Then why'd you flick my forehead?
That hurt!

115
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
See? You're not down anymore.

116
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Just thinking about facing Chakrit

117
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,040
already drains me.

118
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
Don't give up yet.

119
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
I told you there's always a way.

120
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Hello, Baicha. What is it?

121
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,160
Sorry, I'm late, Baicha.
I had urgent documents to sign.

122
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,080
It's fine. I already know everything.

123
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
So, I'll get straight to the point.

124
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
About…

125
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,960
These are my PD Group shares.

126
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
Over the years, I've bought quite a lot.

127
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,800
If we combine them with yours

128
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,960
and the minor shareholders',

129
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,680
I think we can beat Mr. Praphop.

130
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
Thanks for helping me out, Baicha.

131
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,280
I do have one condition though.

132
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
What condition?

133
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,760
You have to divorce Ms. Sarah.

134
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,520
Baicha.

135
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,600
Her offer is reasonable.
It solves everything neatly.

136
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,760
You keep your position, and I…

137
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
I complete my duty.

138
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,840
We'll talk later.

139
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,720
But this offer benefits everyone.

140
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,120
Are you going to let your father's company
fall into someone else's hands?

141
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,040
I said we'll talk later.

142
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,360
You don't have any other options.

143
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,320
At this rate, you'll lose the vote.

144
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,680
If it helps you win, I'm fine with it.

145
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>Thanks for helping me out, Baicha.</i>

146
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,359
I do have one condition though.

147
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
You have to divorce Ms. Sarah.

148
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,040
<i>I'm sorry, Din. I really am.</i>

149
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,400
<i>I just don't want to lose you.</i>

150
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
As you've seen, Mr. Phong,

151
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,600
our gift set is trending everywhere.

152
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,840
<i>Sales are shooting up every day.</i>

153
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,120
<i>I hope that as a shareholder…</i>

154
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
Hello, Mr. Soranut.

155
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,360
I'm sure you've heard
about the upcoming CEO vote.

156
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,280
Is that so, Mr. Weerapol?

157
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
I've been doing my best.

158
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,280
And now we're seeing light
at the end of the tunnel.

159
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,800
The gift set is really taking off.

160
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,920
And I'm more than ready

161
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,800
to continue leading the company
and taking care of this product line.

162
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,000
If we replace the CEO now,

163
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,480
there's no guarantee
Mr. Chakrit can perform better than me.

164
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
You're back late.

165
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,280
I've been talking to the shareholders.

166
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,680
Just divorce me.

167
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,440
Why are you holding on?

168
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,160
All it takes is a signature,
and everything is resolved.

169
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
I know.

170
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,440
Then why?

171
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,200
Because I'm trying not to let it end.

172
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,320
Why bother?

173
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,120
Our marriage

174
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,920
was for our mutual benefit from the start.

175
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,240
You did it for yourself. For the company.

176
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,120
Or do you want to hand over
your power to someone else?

177
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,280
I don't like people
taking advantage of me. Okay?

178
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,560
No, it's not.

179
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Because you took advantage
of me too when I was desperate.

180
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Otherwise, how would
this marriage even exist?

181
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,960
-Yes, but…
-There is no "but".

182
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,800
Let's just get a divorce.

183
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,440
If not, you'll lose everything.

184
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
But I don't want to lose…

185
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,440
Anyway, I'll handle it.

186
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,360
Mind your own business.

187
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Why are you so stubborn?

188
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,640
Are you really that afraid of losing face?

189
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,320
You think I'm that kind of man?

190
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,880
Do you really think that?

191
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,360
What's the matter?

192
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,160
You should know.

193
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,120
Din.

194
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,960
I think you should give up.

195
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,680
Just step down as CEO, that's all.

196
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,440
You'll still keep your shares.
I'm the one who sold everything.

197
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,600
Let it go already.

198
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,480
I think the one clinging on is you, Mom.

199
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
You're clinging to your own comfort.

200
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,520
You only care about the perks. You don't
even care who built this company.

201
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,720
Look at Dad's picture.

202
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Look at his face.

203
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,920
And tell me what you did was right.

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,160
Alright!

205
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,280
I was wrong.

206
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,520
But I did my best.

207
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,360
Your best?

208
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,520
By helping others take over
the company Dad built?

209
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,920
If I ran it poorly and it went under,

210
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,320
I wouldn't complain.

211
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,600
But we're recovering, and you push me out.

212
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,920
How much do we owe Mr. Praphop?

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,640
If I don't get rid of you, will I survive?

214
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I know

215
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
that you never loved me.

216
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
You never treated me like a son
the way you did Nam or Yo.

217
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
But I never thought…

218
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,640
you could be this cruel to me.

219
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,280
Cruel?

220
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,680
You don't know
what I've had to go through.

221
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,840
If I were truly cruel to you,
you wouldn't have made it this far.

222
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
If you knew what your father did to me,

223
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,520
you'd thank me for raising you!

224
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,520
As for the CEO position,
you'll lose it either way.

225
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,680
I've already arranged a comfortable exit.

226
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,480
Whether you accept it or not is up to you.

227
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,520
Right now, we hold 27% of the shares.

228
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,440
Din has 20%.

229
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,360
And?

230
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,760
He's gathering shareholders' votes.

231
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,080
He might get it up to 25.

232
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,840
Not bad.

233
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Still talking big?
Soon, he'll have more than us.

234
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Then let him.

235
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Let him charm whoever he can.

236
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,040
And if he actually gathers them all,

237
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,080
we'll be the losers.

238
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm not underestimating him,
but most of the shares

239
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,560
are tied up with Nam

240
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
and Wayo.

241
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,000
-And?
-Wayo is his mama's boy.

242
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
If we can control Namnuan,
we control Wayo.

243
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,800
As for your beloved Nam,

244
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,000
who knows where he is now.

245
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,520
Even if he's here,

246
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,800
with that sibling rivalry going on,

247
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,680
he won't help his brother.

248
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm begging you, Mr. Nop.

249
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,560
<i>It's not that I don't sympathize with you,</i>
<i>but I'm close with Mr. Praphop.</i>

250
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,320
<i>We've known each other a long time.</i>
<i>I don't want to ruin our relationship.</i>

251
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,640
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

252
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Wait, Mr. Nop. Mr. Nop.

253
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,160
The shop's still open as usual.
Please come support us.

254
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,720
But I haven't been live much lately,
and I haven't posted videos.

255
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,040
Don't forget me. Love you all, mwah!

256
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,160
DIN

257
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,080
So, can we talk now?

258
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,920
If there's anything, just say it.

259
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,760
BAICHA

260
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,720
<i>I'll be straightforward with you.</i>

261
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,960
<i>I want to ask you to vote for Mr. Din.</i>

262
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
<i>I want him to stay on</i>
<i>as CEO of the company.</i>

263
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
And what will I get?

264
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll divorce Mr. Din,

265
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,360
just like you asked.

266
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,680
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you really want to divorce Din?</i>

267
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,160
<i>If you promise,</i>
<i>I will definitely get the divorce.</i>

268
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,640
So, you don't love Din at all?

269
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,600
You're divorcing him so easily.

270
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
I'll answer honestly.

271
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,720
I don't know

272
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,560
how I feel about him.

273
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,600
I only know

274
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,680
that Din is important to me.

275
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
I don't want to see him hurt.

276
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,360
I know the company means a lot to him.

277
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
And me divorcing him…

278
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,680
is my way of doing something for him.

279
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,720
Then go get the divorce first.

280
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,720
Or have Din confirm

281
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,360
he will divorce you for real.

282
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Only then will I promise to help.

283
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,640
But it won't be in time.

284
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
That's your problem, not mine.

285
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,160
Din, did you hear everything?

286
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,000
<i>I heard.</i>

287
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,560
Congratulations.
Ms. Sarah did this for you.

288
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,560
Thanks, Baicha.

289
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,560
<i>So now, it's only up to you.</i>

290
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,920
Will you accept my proposal?

291
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,880
No.

292
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,480
I will never divorce her.

293
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,600
Even if you have to lose everything?

294
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
Even if I lose everything,

295
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,760
I'll still have Sara.

296
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,200
Okay.

297
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,960
I understand now.

298
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
<i>Thank you.</i>

299
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
What's wrong?

300
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,480
I've lost, Nam.

301
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,520
I've lost…

302
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,080
There's nothing I can do anymore.

303
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,920
It's alright, it's alright. It's okay.

304
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Good evening, Mr. Arun.

305
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,840
Mr. Din, you're hanging out here too?

306
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,480
No, not really.

307
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,240
I actually came to see you, Mr. Arun.

308
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,640
I couldn't get hold of you,
so I checked with the secretary.

309
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,320
She said you were hanging out here.

310
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,280
So, I came by.

311
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
Mr. Arun's a VIP here.

312
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,160
You did your homework well.

313
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,520
But you're a bit late.

314
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,640
Mr. Arun.

315
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
As promised.

316
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,880
Please enjoy.

317
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Go.

318
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,760
Alright.

319
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,360
I really like this.

320
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
Come on, girls.

321
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,600
Let's go have fun inside.

322
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,240
-Daddy.
-Yeah.

323
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,400
What are your names?

324
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,400
Sorry about that, Din.

325
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
But you're a bit late.

326
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,960
I'm just not one
for opportunists like you.

327
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,400
Whatever it takes, I don't care.

328
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,480
If I can get what your father
stole from mine back,

329
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,480
I'll be satisfied.

330
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,880
How long have you been
going on about this?

331
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,520
It's obvious

332
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,520
that your father misused company funds.

333
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,400
If my dad hadn't forced him to sell
shares, the company would've collapsed.

334
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,920
I don't buy your fairy tales.

335
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
It won't be long.

336
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,360
-You won't make it.
-If I don't make it,

337
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
it won't be because of you.

338
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,320
You can't do anything to me.

339
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,480
The real winner will be Uncle Praphop.

340
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,880
You're just a pawn.

341
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,600
And that talk about
getting everything back, in the end,

342
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,400
you won't get anything either.

343
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
If I get to watch
you people crash and burn,

344
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,680
that alone

345
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,440
is satisfying enough.

346
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
Ms. Sarah did so much for Din.

347
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
But he still won't let go.

348
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
They didn't marry for money, did they?

349
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
You really think so?

350
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,960
There, there, stop crying.

351
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
It's getting too loud.

352
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,720
So… Why did you come back?

353
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,120
Because of your email.

354
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,760
You sent it to me like that
and you're still asking?

355
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
So, what now with Din?

356
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,000
Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,320
Is the office too small?

358
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,960
Get ready to move into the CEO office.

359
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,760
If it weren't for your backing,
I wouldn't be here.

360
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,960
There's just one step left.

361
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,160
Once the vote's done,
everything will be official.

362
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,640
That matter

363
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
is no longer an issue.

364
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,560
What's important

365
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,200
is what comes next.

366
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,200
So, don't worry, sir.

367
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,520
Anything profitable, I'll keep doing.

368
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,440
Like that gift set
Din worked so hard to make popular.

369
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,760
I won't touch it.

370
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,000
But the one behind it must be removed,

371
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,200
so we won't have to look
over our shoulders.

372
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,120
Good, very good.

373
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,200
That's what I want.

374
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,600
And remember this.

375
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,080
What's hard to gain is harder to keep.

376
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,160
Yes, sir.

377
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,360
<i>It's time for the meeting.</i>
<i>Shareholders are all present.</i>

378
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,440
I'll be there soon.

379
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,360
You can still call Ms. Baicha now.

380
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,920
I told you,

381
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,560
I won't divorce you.

382
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,679
Mr. Din.

383
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,480
The CEO post matters to you.

384
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,920
You can't just give it up

385
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,760
when there's a way out like this.

386
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,440
Just divorce me

387
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,840
and you'll be safe.

388
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,120
You said you wouldn't leave me.

389
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,000
No matter what happens.

390
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
I won't leave you either.

391
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,800
Sorry I'm late.

392
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
It's alright.

393
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,840
We've only just gathered,
not even five minutes ago.

394
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
This meeting

395
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,320
is for shareholders only.

396
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
You've sold all your shares.

397
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,400
So, I'll have to ask you to step out, Mom.

398
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,560
I'm here on Wayo's behalf.
Here's the authorization letter.

399
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,760
Alright then.
Let's not waste any more time.

400
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,720
Let's begin the voting.

401
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
I'd like everyone

402
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,840
to cast your vote for whoever you support.

403
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,800
Please go ahead.

404
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,440
You're back.

405
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,440
My brother's in trouble, isn't he?

406
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,080
You know what's going on?

407
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,040
On a day like this,
how could I possibly miss it?

408
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,280
I'm not sure

409
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,400
why you hate your brother.

410
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,080
But what I am sure of

411
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,840
is that your brother
did everything for the company.

412
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,520
He did whatever it took for the company.

413
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,080
So much that he didn't care
how anyone else felt.

414
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,440
So, if he loses his position today,

415
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,520
it's only fair, isn't it?

416
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,800
<i>You're not jealous of me.</i>

417
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,480
You're jealous of Sarach, you snake.

418
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,360
<i>I don't even want to imagine</i>

419
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,920
<i>that you could be this selfish.</i>

420
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,640
<i>Even if I weren't,</i>
<i>you'd never choose me anyway.</i>

421
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I was the only one who was allergic.</i>

422
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,920
I already checked.

423
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,720
Our cream doesn't cause reactions.

424
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,960
Even you, with your sensitive skin,
can use it just fine.

425
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,440
Someone is sabotaging us.

426
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,120
