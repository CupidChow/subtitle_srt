1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>Your job is to get PD for us</i>

2
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,480
<i>in exchange for your revenge</i>

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>without causing us to lose our interests.</i>

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
<i>So, just focus on how</i>

5
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,240
<i>you can get Din out of the way.</i>

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
<i>I don't know why you're mad</i>

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
<i>that I talked to Ms. Sarah about this.</i>

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>Maybe it's about what happened that night.</i>

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
You said sorry, now go back.

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
<i>I'm pregnant, Din.</i>

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,640
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,440
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,759
<i>What about you?</i>

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
I've called you many times.
It's like you didn't even see me.

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm just stressed about work.

17
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,280
I think we should go to bed.

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Let's go.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,560
<i>Can you come out and meet me?</i>

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,800
You should go upstairs
and get some rest first.

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,760
There's another problem at the factory.

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Here. Make sure you eat well, Baicha.

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
Next time, I'll bring
you some supplements too.

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
We might not get to see
each other as often.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
But I'll keep you updated
through text messages.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
Why is that?

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm afraid Krit might lose it again.

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
He's gone too far to turn back now.

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,320
You need to be really careful, Din.

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,160
Thanks.

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,440
I will.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,080
That's not all.

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm worried Nam
might get dragged into this too.

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,680
But he's never had
any serious issues with Chakrit.

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Why would he hurt him?

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,680
Is Nam the baby's father?

37
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,640
Nam has to know about this.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,160
No, Din.

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,640
Nam still only sees me as a friend.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,760
Even if he knows

41
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
the baby is his,

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,760
he might take responsibility,

43
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,440
but he won't love the child.

44
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Do you really want my child

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,960
to feel the same way you did?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
But no matter what, Nam has to know.

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,400
A man has to take responsibility
for his own mistakes.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,120
And then what?

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
If Krit finds out,

50
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
he'll kill Nam for sure.

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,240
But how can I let you
carry this burden alone?

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Din.

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
- Baicha, let go.
- Din…

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
If you pressure me too,

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll get an abortion.

56
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
It's already past midnight.

57
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,520
Toy, are you asleep?

58
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Can I talk to you about something?

59
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
Lately, Din's been leaving
the house a lot.

60
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,200
I can't reach him, and I'm worried.

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,840
I don't know if he's dealing
with something he won't tell me about.

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,600
Are you crazy? An affair?

63
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
That's ridiculous.
Din's not that kind of person.

64
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm not taking his side.

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
The payment for the old video.

66
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Thanks.

67
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Did someone forget something today?

68
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,320
The editing, right?
I'm rushing to finish it.

69
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,320
Wishing you happiness
and big success, Cherry!

70
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
Triple happiness, my friend!

71
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,720
May your channel blow up
to a million followers soon.

72
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Thanks so much, everyone.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,920
Anyone who wants cake, go ahead.

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm not in the mood to eat.

75
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Din gave us money to treat everyone.

76
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,400
Yeah! That was the plan.

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,520
To use it for your birthday meal.

78
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,880
- Yeah, let's eat.
- Exactly.

79
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,600
Come on. Don't sulk, Cherry.

80
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,760
Is your period late or something?

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,680
Stop it. Go to class already.

82
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,120
So I can party with Sarach later.

83
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
Hey, what about the cake?

84
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,960
You can eat it in class.
The professor won't mind.

85
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
But if you're late, you'll get scolded.

86
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
She's moved on from the cake, huh?

87
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,200
Come on. Let's go to class.

88
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
Let's go, Sarach.

89
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,080
We're partying tonight, right?

90
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,640
You've got this. I'm rooting for you.

91
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,200
Nina would like to submit
another proposal for new machinery.

92
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,640
Since Ms. Sara's men's product project

93
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
is about to begin,

94
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,159
we should increase production capacity.

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,480
But we shouldn't outsource it.

96
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,640
If we manufacture it ourselves,
the cost will be lower.

97
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,520
I can guarantee

98
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,920
the machines I found

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,640
are definitely cheaper than Mr. Chakrit's.

100
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,560
But…

101
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
I don't agree with rushing
into this investment yet.

102
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,320
The company's still unstable.
Why don't we wait another three months?

103
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,720
For PD's long-term stability.

104
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
Well…

105
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,120
Speaking on behalf of the real CEO,
aren't you, Mr. Pathawee?

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Based on the machinery documents,

107
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
what Ms. Nina found is better
and more beneficial to the company.

108
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,200
There's no sign of corruption.

109
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,240
For my peace of mind as CEO,

110
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,600
may I exercise my right to remove
Mr. Chakrit from the board?

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,920
He seems to contribute nothing.

112
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,800
And a CEO who only follows
his older brother's orders,

113
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,080
should he really still be CEO, Mr. Apo?

114
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,200
At least I don't use dirty tactics
that damage my own company.

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think we should all calm down first.

116
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,400
And I apologize on Mr. Apo's behalf.

117
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,760
He didn't mean it that way.

118
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,120
As for the machinery,

119
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,240
may I consult
with our engineering team first?

120
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
But personally…

121
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,040
That's fine, Din.

122
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Just don't let it take too long.

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,960
I'm concerned about
the company's interests.

124
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Thank you, Nina.

125
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,960
Uncle Krit!

126
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,760
- Oh.
- Hi!

127
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,240
Wow, long time no see!
You've gotten more handsome.

128
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

129
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,200
Hi.

130
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,680
Is this your uncle, Cherry?

131
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,360
He's handsome. Is he
an influencer like Baicha too?

132
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,600
Nope. My super-handsome uncle

133
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,720
isn't really into constantly
coming up with content.

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Wow, both you and your friends
have such sweet mouths.

135
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,560
So, what are you all doing here?

136
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
Everyone forgot my birthday.

137
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,600
At least Aunt Baicha didn't.

138
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,480
She even gave us a birthday meal discount.
I'm eating a lot.

139
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Oh, come on.

140
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,000
Aren't you overthinking it?

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Honestly, I forget dates too.

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,480
Like today, I thought it was Tuesday,

143
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
but it's actually Wednesday.

144
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
You done weaseling your way out?

145
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Sorry, sorry. How about this?

146
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,480
I'll make it up to you. Drinks later?

147
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,400
Sure. Just don't forget to set a date.

148
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,680
- Then I'll excuse myself.
- Sure.

149
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,760
- Cherry.
- Yes?

150
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,560
I think…

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll make it up to you tonight.

152
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Really?

153
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,840
Thank you, Uncle Krit! You're the best.

154
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,360
This is my first time partying like this.

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
This is insanely fun!

156
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,240
Whoa.

157
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Such dramatic acting.

158
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,600
This isn't an acting class.

159
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,560
Such a buzzkill.

160
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Thank you so much for today, Uncle Krit.

161
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,720
Alright. Here.

162
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
Don't drink and drive,
and don't stay out too late.

163
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
You won't survive class tomorrow.

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes, my handsome uncle.

165
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,840
- I'll head out first.
- Okay.

166
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Keep an eye on your friends.

167
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,560
Kids, I'm off.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Where did your uncle go, Cherry?

169
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,680
He left. Paid for everything,
but he's not joining us.

170
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,640
Guess he's not into partying with us kids.

171
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
So, should we keep drinking?

172
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

173
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,640
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

174
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,800
This glass goes to the one in white.

175
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,520
The other four,

176
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
give them to anyone.

177
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes, sir.

178
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,320
This way, no one loses anything.

179
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,560
You can't really blame me.

180
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,800
- Wow.
- Oh my.

181
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Look at that.

182
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,560
This one's on Uncle Krit.

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,440
Come on. Cheers!

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
- Yay!
- Yeah.

186
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,880
That's awesome.

187
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,640
Your uncle is seriously the best.

188
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,920
I'm going to the toilet.

189
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,400
Wayo, are you okay?

190
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
Do you need me to support you?

191
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,080
Ugh, I'm so dizzy.

192
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,640
I can barely stand.

193
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,440
The real drama queen

194
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
is sitting right there.

195
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
She didn't even need to study.
She could totally be an actress.

196
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
Such a pro.

197
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,120
A pro, sure, but it feels off.
Is this really okay?

198
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Hey.

199
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
Gossiping up close, huh?

200
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
Kidding.

201
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,280
My head hurts.

202
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
It's so stuffy in here.
I can barely breathe.

203
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm going outside for some air.

204
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,360
Okay.

205
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
I'll have a drink.

206
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
Yo!

207
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
Hey!

208
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
Bumped into someone
and don't even apologize?

209
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,800
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

210
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
Yo!

211
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm picking a fight.

212
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
And?

213
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
What was that?

214
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,480
You space out all day, your mind's
never here, and you get home late.

215
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,119
I can't take this anymore.

216
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,599
If you've got a problem, just say it.

217
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,520
No. I don't have a problem at all.

218
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,560
We're only pretending to be married.

219
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,839
If you want to see other people,
I won't hold it against you.

220
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,480
Just do it properly, and don't
stab me in the back, that's all.

221
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,280
You're taking this way too far.

222
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,800
How could I have someone else?

223
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,240
Why couldn't you, when we--

224
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,760
I can't have anyone else.

225
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,280
Because I…

226
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
What's up, Sarach?

227
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
What are you doing?

228
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm just finding

229
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,840
a way to make you

230
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,040
give me your shares,

231
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,360
handsome.

232
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,600
Back off.

233
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,120
- Hey.
- Wayo.

234
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
Don't be stubborn.

235
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,160
Be a good boy, handsome.

236
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,360
Alright?

237
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,280
<i>Sir, this is from the front desk.</i>

238
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,640
<i>Someone reported your room to the police.</i>

239
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,960
<i>They said it was loud</i>
<i>and involved illegal activity.</i>

240
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,160
That's bullshit. We weren't even loud.
You've got the wrong room.

241
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Hello?

242
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,320
<i>If you don't want this to get serious,</i>
<i>check out now,</i>

243
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,800
<i>before the police show up.</i>

244
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,480
If I go out there
and nothing's like you said,

245
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
you're done for.

246
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,040
What the hell?

247
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
Yo.

248
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,680
Yo! Yo!

249
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,520
If you mess with my brother again,

250
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
you'll get it even worse.

251
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,680
You

252
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
and your brothers…

253
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,000
I won't spare either of you.

254
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,000
Pfft!

255
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
Are you feeling better?
If not, we'll go see a doctor.

256
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,800
Here, drink more water. Drink plenty.

257
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,040
That's enough.

258
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm about to pee myself.

259
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,080
The bathroom's right there.
What are you scared of? I'll stand guard.

260
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,960
No one's going to hurt you now.

261
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,560
It's kind of good this happened.

262
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,720
Feels like I've got you back.

263
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,560
What's good about it?

264
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
What if I hadn't made it in time, huh?

265
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
Want some more water?

266
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,920
No, thanks. I'm okay now.

267
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,640
That's a relief.

268
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,120
Sarach was really worried about you.

269
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,240
By the way,

270
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880
how did you even find me?

271
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,960
Sarach called me.

272
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,920
He was really worried about you.

273
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,000
Just as worried as Mr. Din.

274
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,560
Baicha, Chakrit's taking Yo somewhere.

275
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>‪What? What the hell did Krit do?</i>

276
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,360
Please, help Yo.

277
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,320
I don't know where Chakrit took him.

278
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,360
I can track Krit's phone through the app.

279
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,360
<i>If his phone's on, we'll know where he is.</i>

280
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,320
<i>I'll send you the location right away.</i>

281
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,320
Thank you so much.

282
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,960
<i>After that, I called Sarach</i>
<i>to meet us here.</i>

283
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,440
So we could get to you in time.

284
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,960
I'll step out and call Mr. Din then.

285
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't know how he's doing.

286
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,560
Here.

287
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,600
Hungry? We've got some snacks.

288
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,880
Thanks.

289
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
And I'm sorry.

290
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
I never meant to look down on you.

291
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,960
I said what I said to Cherry

292
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,000
because she kept pushing nonstop.

293
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,040
And sometimes, it's hard
to accept your own feelings.

294
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
What feelings?

295
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
Well…

296
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Well…

297
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,120
Well?

298
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I guess I like you.

299
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,840
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Sarach.

301
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,640
Can I ask you something?

302
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,920
Can we stop fighting?

303
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
I don't like us when we're like this.

304
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,600
No.

305
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't want to be just friends.

306
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,040
How the hell did Din know where I was?

307
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,000
Well, how could he not?

308
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,560
You dragged Wayo's whole group along.
Someone was bound to see you.

309
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,320
I know you're annoyed,
but I have to say it again.

310
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,960
What's done is done. Let it go.

311
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,840
Who was right or wrong
doesn't matter anymore. It can't be fixed.

312
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,480
You know I'm annoyed, so why even say it?

313
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Fine.

314
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,240
Baicha.

315
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,840
I know you love me.

316
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,320
But everything I've done,

317
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
I did it for our family.

318
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,480
Our family

319
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,600
can't just accept
being hurt by theirs one-sidedly.

320
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,400
Put this on first.

321
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,360
I'll go get you some painkillers.

322
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,520
BAICHA

323
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
DIN

324
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,120
Baicha, someone's calling.

325
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,560
Baicha.

326
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,360
Who were you talking to?

327
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
Oh, just giving some work instructions.

328
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,040
DIN

329
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,960
Din?

330
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,960
Let's go eat. You'll be late for work.

331
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay.

332
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,480
<i>Are you home yet?</i>

333
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
<i>Don't forget to take your supplements.</i>

334
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,400
<i>If you really plan to go abroad,</i>
<i>I'll take care of everything.</i>

335
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,520
<i>So you can give birth in peace.</i>

336
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,720
<i>Once everything's settled,</i>
<i>you can come back.</i>

337
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
Here are the painkillers.
Take them before--

338
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,760
What is this, Baicha?!

339
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,280
I asked you, what is this?!

340
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,280
Answer me! What is this?!

341
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Baicha.

342
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,200
"If you really plan to go abroad,

343
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
I'll take care of everything.

344
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,680
So you can give birth in peace."

345
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Baicha!

346
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,560
You're pregnant?!

347
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Are you?!

348
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Why won't you answer me?!
You're pregnant?!

349
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Baicha!

350
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,720
Baicha.

351
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,520
You know how much I love you, Baicha.

352
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
If just now

353
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,240
you'd lied to me even a little,

354
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,720
I would've pretended to believe you.

355
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,920
But you admitted the truth.

356
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,440
Good!

357
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,440
Now everything makes sense.

358
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,480
Baicha.

359
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,720
You're pregnant with Din's child, right?

360
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Are you pregnant with Din's child?

361
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
That's why nothing I do ever works.

362
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,600
Because you betrayed me, didn't you?!

363
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Krit…

364
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,280
No, it's not Din. Please don't hurt him.

365
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
Not him?

366
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
If it's not him,

367
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,480
then why would he text you like this?!

368
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,800
‪Krit, it's not Din.

369
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,600
Don't say another word!

370
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,760
Din.

371
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,080
You touched my sister, Din.
You touched my sister!

372
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,120
- You're dead, Din!
- Krit! Krit!

373
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,560
‪Krit.

374
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
Don't go. I'm begging you.

375
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,280
I won't allow it.

376
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,320
Listen to me. After Din
humiliated me like this.

377
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,240
If I can't kill him,

378
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,880
I'll kill

379
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,000
everyone in his family.

380
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,080
Krit! Krit!

381
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,280
Hey…

382
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,640
Are you worried about me?

383
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Afraid I'll be malnourished,

384
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,600
or hoping I get heart disease faster?

385
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,520
Please explain yourself.

386
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,840
Feeding me only egg yolks?

387
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm not obsessed with health.

388
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,640
And I'm not trying to lose weight
or anything. I just…

389
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,000
don't like them.

390
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,840
I saw you could eat them,
so I gave them to you.

391
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,160
Didn't want to waste food.

392
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,520
So, should I be happy?

393
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,600
You let me eat what I actually want,
and you don't waste food.

394
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,880
You should be proud of that.

395
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,520
BAICHA

396
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,240
Hello?

397
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,040
<i>Something happened, Din.</i>

398
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Baicha, what is it?

399
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,920
<i>Krit knows everything now.</i>

400
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,360
He lost it and drove off.

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm scared, Din.

402
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,120
He's driving? Does he know where Nam is?

403
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,520
No. He thinks it's you.

404
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
Good. At least Nam will be safe.

405
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,960
Let him come. I'm not afraid.

406
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,200
But I'm scared
something will happen to him.

407
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,760
He's my only brother.

408
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,160
If anything happens to him because of me,

409
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,160
I couldn't live with it.

410
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,280
It's okay.

411
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,280
I have a plan. No one's
going to get hurt. Trust me.

412
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,000
DIN

413
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,280
Din.

414
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,200
If you're so tough, come out and face me.

415
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,240
You're too enraged to do anything to me.

416
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,440
You've already lost your head.

417
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,520
You did that to my sister,

418
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,560
and you still expect me to stay calm?

419
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,080
One day you'll understand.

420
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't understand a damn thing!

421
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
If I can't touch you,

422
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,040
don't think I'll just sit back.

423
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,120
The people closest to you,
I'll deal with them instead.

424
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Hello, Baicha.

425
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,639
<i>Is Krit still at the house, Din?</i>

426
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,199
He is. But he'll probably leave soon.

427
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,840
You should stay somewhere else
for now, for the baby's safety.

428
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Yes. With Krit this unstable,

429
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,199
if he finds out Nam is the father,

430
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,960
Nam will definitely be dead.

431
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,239
Don't be afraid.

432
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,480
I'll handle everything.

433
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,400
Okay, Din.

434
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,880
Why did Chakrit come here?

435
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,280
What did you do? Why did
the police come to our house?

436
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,360
- It's nothing.
- How could it be nothing?

437
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,600
I saw Chakrit's car outside.

438
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,320
Was he here to hurt you?
Is that why you called the police?

439
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,080
You already know everything. Why ask me?

440
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,800
You never told me what you did.

441
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,680
If someone like Chakrit

442
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,040
is crazy enough to storm in here,

443
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,440
it can't be something small.

444
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
What if Yo and I
get dragged into this too?

445
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,040
Fine. If you won't tell me,
I'll ask Krit myself.

446
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
I'll make it clear I'm not involved.

447
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,040
Mom, wait.

448
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Don't get involved with Chakrit.

449
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,800
Then tell me. What did you do?

450
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,560
Baicha is pregnant.

451
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Pregnant?

452
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,920
Who's the father?

453
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,000
She's pregnant with…

454
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,640
What does that have to do with us?

455
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't tell me…

456
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,640
You?

457
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,120
Yes.

458
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,680
Baicha is pregnant with my baby.

459
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
Is that what you wanted to hear?

460
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,400
Satisfied now?

461
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,320
Then you should also know

462
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,840
this happened because of your control.

463
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,760
Nina. Nam. Forcing me
into that staged marriage with Sara.

464
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,960
You have no idea how much
it ruined my life.

465
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,440
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

466
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,600
<i>I know I've caused you trouble,</i>
<i>but don't worry.</i>

467
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,800
<i>I won't be a burden to you anymore.</i>

468
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
<i>What will happen</i>
<i>to the baby when it's born?</i>

469
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,720
<i>There's no way to fix this.</i>

470
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,440
I have my own way of ending this.

471
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,280
Nam said he'd come to the office,
but he still hasn't shown up.

472
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,320
<i>Did he tell you anything?</i>

473
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,120
<i>There's nothing wrong with him.</i>

474
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,800
<i>He's just shocked that his brother</i>
<i>got his best friend pregnant.</i>

475
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,120
<i>Playing the good guy,</i>

476
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,680
<i>while you knocked up my sister</i>
<i>behind my back.</i>

477
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,880
<i>You Phimarndech bastards…</i>

478
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,640
<i>I'll kill every single one of you.</i>

479
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,960
