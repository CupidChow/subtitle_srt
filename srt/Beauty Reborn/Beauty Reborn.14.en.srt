1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,880
<i>We're only pretending to be married.</i>
<i>If you want to see other people,</i>

2
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>I won't hold it against you.</i>

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,280
Just do it properly, and don't
stab me in the back, that's all.

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
<i>After Din humiliated me like this.</i>

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
<i>If I can't kill him,</i>

6
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
<i>I'll kill everyone in his family.</i>

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,600
What did you do?
I saw Chakrit's car outside.

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
<i>Baicha is pregnant.</i>

9
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
<i>Who's the father?</i>

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>- Don't tell me…</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
<i>Baicha is pregnant with my baby.</i>

12
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,120
Sara.

13
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
I…

14
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,800
Please let me explain first.

15
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
Explain what?

16
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,560
How much your life
was ruined because of me?

17
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,880
It's…

18
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
It's complicated.

19
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
I don't even know where to begin.

20
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,760
If you can't begin,
then let's just end it.

21
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,800
I'm not ready to hear anything right now.

22
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
I know I've caused you trouble.

24
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,840
But don't worry.

25
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,520
I won't be a burden to you anymore.

26
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,240
Baicha!

27
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
Baicha!

28
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,040
<i>Sorry, the number you've dialed</i>
<i>cannot be connected at this time…</i>

29
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
Baicha!

30
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,320
Ms. Baicha has been out
for a while now, sir.

31
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Looks like she'll be gone
for several days.

32
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
How do you know that?

33
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
She took a large suitcase with her.

34
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
When I asked where she was going,

35
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,880
she just said she was going on a trip.
She didn't say where.

36
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Useless. Get out of my face!

37
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
Dad.

39
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, Sara.

40
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,360
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

41
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,280
And why did you bring your luggage?

42
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
What's wrong?

43
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
Did someone hurt you?

44
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,840
It's okay, sweetheart. I'm here now.

45
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,600
It's okay. Everything's okay now.

46
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Baicha.

47
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,800
I bought some supplements for you.

48
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
As for food,

49
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
if you don't feel like going out,

50
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
you can just order room service.

51
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
And if you need anything…

52
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Baicha?

53
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,880
Are you okay?

54
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm stressed.

55
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,440
I never thought I'd end up like this.

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm scared Nam
might be in danger if I tell him.

57
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
And even if I do,

58
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,480
he might still see me as just a friend.

59
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,280
How are we supposed to live like that?

60
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,120
What will happen
to the baby when it's born?

61
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
There's no…

62
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,640
There's no way to fix this.

63
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
There is.

64
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
I have my own way of ending this.

65
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
How?

66
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll be the child's father.

67
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,680
Din…

68
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
I don't know
if this is the right decision, but…

69
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,960
it feels like the best solution,

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
for now.

71
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
I promise

72
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,720
I'll take care of you and the baby

73
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,040
the best I can.

74
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,400
Put this bag in the fridge,
or it’ll spoil.

75
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,400
- Okay.
- And this one's for everyone.

76
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Share it.

77
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,040
Thank you, Mr. Nam.

78
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
I thought you'd never set foot
in this house again.

79
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I missed you so much, Mom.

80
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
Don't sweet-talk me.

81
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,240
Did you miss me or someone else?

82
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course, I missed you.

83
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,680
Mom.

84
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,640
Don't stress about the company.

85
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,080
If you want any position, just tell me.

86
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll handle it.

87
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
It's just…

88
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,360
I hate losing my salary and benefits.

89
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,720
And I'm furious
that those two betrayed me.

90
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
You should be careful too.

91
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes, Mom.

92
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Why is the house so quiet today?

93
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,000
If you're asking that,

94
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
then you really don't know yet.

95
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Know what?

96
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
Your dear brother Din

97
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,320
got Baicha pregnant.

98
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,760
So, Sara packed up and went back home.

99
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,200
Nam, where are you going?

100
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Nam, what are you doing?
Did you hear what I said?

101
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,840
Nam, what are you going to do?

102
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm going to ask Baicha what's going on.

103
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,840
Then call her. Why rush off like that?

104
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
You just got home.

105
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,640
Hey, Nam! Nam!

106
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of this?

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,280
Stupid kid.

108
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,480
You worry about everyone,
except your own mother.

109
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,480
Din…

110
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,560
Playing the good guy,

111
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,520
while you knocked up my sister
behind my back.

112
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,640
You want to mess with me, huh?

113
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
Fine.

114
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,760
You Phimarndech people,

115
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,680
I'll kill every single one of you.

116
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
Who are you here to see, sir?

117
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
Is Baicha here?

118
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,800
Apo.

119
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,880
Come on in.

120
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,880
Your wife hasn't come back.

121
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,440
Stop hoping.

122
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,120
I didn't call about that.

123
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
<i>I called to ask about Nam.</i>

124
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,720
He said he'd come to work,

125
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
but he still hasn't shown up.

126
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,720
I called him. No answer.
He hasn't called back either.

127
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,360
So, I wanted to ask…

128
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,280
Did he tell you anything?

129
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,480
There's nothing wrong with him.

130
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,400
He's just shocked that his brother

131
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,680
got his best friend pregnant.

132
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,920
<i>As soon as he found out, he ran off.</i>

133
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Mom!

134
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,600
Answer the phone, Nam.

135
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,800
DIN

136
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,160
You won't even take your brother's call?

137
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
So, is Baicha here?

138
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,640
If she's not, I'll leave.

139
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,160
Why are you here

140
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,400
looking for my sister?

141
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,960
Are you here to ask if she's okay?

142
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Or to ask her

143
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,800
how it feels

144
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
to be pregnant by a married man?!

145
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
Nam?

146
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Nam.

147
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,960
Din.

148
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
Nam, are you okay?

149
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,280
You really think the worst of me,
don't you, Din?

150
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,240
You two talk it out yourselves.

151
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
Just do it somewhere else.

152
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,600
If I keep seeing his face,
I might lose control.

153
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
Did he do anything to you?

154
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
What did you say to him?

155
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
Your father got my father killed,

156
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,720
and now that your brother's married,

157
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,360
he still got my sister pregnant?

158
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
Is Baicha really pregnant with Din's baby?

159
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,680
Do I look like I'm joking right now, huh?

160
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,359
How do you feel about my sister?

161
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,200
I asked you. Answer me!

162
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
What do you feel toward her?

163
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
Baicha is my best friend.

164
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,720
I'll do anything

165
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,359
to protect my friend.

166
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,400
Then look at this.

167
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,080
I took this from Baicha's phone

168
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,880
and sent it to mine.

169
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,480
If your brother didn't do anything,

170
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,320
why would he send something like this?

171
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,720
At this point,

172
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,160
I don't care anymore.

173
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I'll make my sister get an abortion.

174
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,120
That filthy Phimarndech blood

175
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,040
means nothing to me.

176
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,960
What are you going to do?

177
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,840
What do you think someone like me

178
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
is capable of?

179
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
Especially to your family.

180
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,520
Even Baicha.

181
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,720
I love her.

182
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,600
I care about her this much.

183
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,560
But if she doesn't understand,

184
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,080
anything can happen.

185
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,920
If I can't kill you all outright,

186
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,560
I'll make you suffer while you're alive.

187
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Don't worry though.

188
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,280
The company,

189
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,880
my sister…

190
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll come for all of it.

191
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
And we'll see who wins.

192
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,720
This isn't good at all.

193
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,320
You don't like the food I made?

194
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
You didn't say anything
while you were eating.

195
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,120
What I meant is,

196
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,320
if you cook like this for me every day,

197
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,640
I'll end up overweight.

198
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,680
The doctor will definitely nag me.

199
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,840
You scared me.

200
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
I thought you didn't like my food.

201
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Alright.

202
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,040
Hey, wait, wait.
I'll help. I'll help. Come on.

203
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,680
Come on.

204
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,760
Let's clean up.

205
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,680
Why didn't you ask me?

206
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,320
About…

207
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,800
what happened to me.

208
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,480
I didn't ask

209
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,120
because I know you're not ready yet.

210
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
When you are,

211
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,840
you'll tell me yourself. Right?

212
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
Alright.

213
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,280
Sara.

214
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,040
Din.

215
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
You didn't mishear, Din.

216
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,040
I plan to take over
the For Men project myself.

217
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,840
I mean, honestly,
I don't have a problem with that.

218
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,720
It's just that I started this project,
so I probably know it better.

219
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,200
I understand.

220
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,240
But now you're the only one
left on this project.

221
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
As for Ms. Sarah,

222
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,160
she's abandoned us.

223
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,320
She hasn't come to work or put in leave.

224
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
According to company policy,

225
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,320
if we still can't reach her,
she has to be terminated.

226
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,560
If you don't object,

227
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,520
I'll take that as your approval.

228
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Well…

229
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,600
Then I'll take over this project.

230
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,800
Thank you very much.

231
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Originally, the men's product line launch

232
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,960
only included a serum,
an anti-wrinkle product,

233
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
and shaving cream with aftershave.

234
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,680
But since we're entering
this market anyway,

235
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,520
I propose we launch the full line.

236
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,840
I don't think we should.

237
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Men aren't the same as women.

238
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,400
The three products we chose,
almost every man uses them.

239
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,520
Anything beyond that
depends on preference.

240
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
If it fails, we'll take a serious hit.

241
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,040
The additional investment isn't that high.

242
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
If the products catch on,

243
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,840
the return will be more than worth it.

244
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
Right, Nam?

245
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,240
Okay. I agree.

246
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Well then,

247
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,840
since the CEO agrees,

248
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I assume you have no objections,
Mr. Pathawee?

249
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,400
Expanding the product line?

250
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
I completely disagree.

251
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
You're in product development.

252
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,400
You follow the CEO's orders.

253
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,480
Whether you agree or not

254
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,400
isn't important.

255
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,560
If it fails,

256
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
are we supposed to keep going?

257
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,000
That's a very strange way
to manage a company,

258
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
Mr. Chakrit.

259
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,800
We haven't even launched yet.

260
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,560
How can you be so sure it'll lose money?

261
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,200
Every product

262
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,080
beyond the original three

263
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,920
already has dominant players
in the market.

264
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,000
And we don't have enough capital
to spread ourselves that thin.

265
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
If one or two products fail,

266
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,520
they'll drag the rest down with them.

267
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Why take that risk?

268
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,600
If I say too much,

269
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,840
it'll sound like I'm siding with my wife.

270
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
But I agree we shouldn't take the risk.

271
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,040
Nam, what do you think?

272
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,600
Let's put this on hold for now.

273
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,920
I need more data before making a decision.

274
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,920
I suggest

275
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,320
we postpone the meeting until next week.

276
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,200
Next time, knock before coming in.

277
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,880
If you have something to say,
say it quickly.

278
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
I have work to do.

279
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,440
If there's nothing,

280
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,240
you may leave.

281
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm sorry.

282
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Please come in.

283
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
Mr. Pathawee came in

284
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,040
and didn't say a word.

285
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,680
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

286
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,280
<i>I'll destroy your entire family.</i>

287
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,560
Even Sarah.

288
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,480
If I have to,

289
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,720
I won't spare her either.

290
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,240
It's nothing.

291
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,760
You probably have something
you want to talk about.

292
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,440
Let's talk somewhere else.
This isn't a good place.

293
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,440
Come on.

294
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,800
Good evening.

295
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,800
You're heading home late today.
Would you like me to call you a cab?

296
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Oh, I already booked a ride
through an app. It's on the way.

297
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,760
- Thank you.
- Of course.

298
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
Hello, Ms. Sarah.

299
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,640
I'd like to recommend the strawberry soda.

300
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,360
Sweet and tangy,
fizzy, and very refreshing.

301
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,960
Let's not waste time on small talk.

302
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,040
If you have something to say,
please be direct. I'm ready to listen.

303
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,560
I assume you already know everything.

304
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,600
That I'm pregnant with Din's child.

305
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,560
We want to build a family together.

306
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,920
Your marriage to Din

307
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,640
was based on the company's interests,

308
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
and it's no longer necessary.

309
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,320
I think it's time for you to step aside.

310
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't hold on to the marriage certificate
for your own benefit.

311
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,360
Me? Holding on?

312
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,480
I think you're misunderstanding something.

313
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,480
The moment Mr. Din sets a date,

314
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm ready to sign the divorce papers.

315
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,880
So, I think

316
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,160
you should talk to him
about this yourself,

317
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
rather than coming to me.

318
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,960
But the fact

319
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,800
that you came to see me personally

320
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,520
means…

321
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,840
you haven't told him yet.

322
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,000
Or have you, and he refuses to divorce me?

323
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,440
You seem very confident in yourself.

324
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
Why did you say
something like that to Sara?

325
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,360
Why?

326
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
Are you angry with me?

327
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm not angry.

328
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,920
Right now, I only have you left.

329
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
You know that.

330
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,080
I have no one else now.

331
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,440
Krit is upset with me.

332
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,000
And Nam doesn't love me.

333
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,960
He only sees me as a friend.

334
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,840
If I lose you too,

335
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,000
I won't be able to go on.

336
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,680
<i>For my child, I have to be selfish.</i>

337
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
<i>I'm sorry, Din.</i>

338
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,120
Hello, Baicha. I've arrived.

339
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,920
Okay. I'll wait in the car.

340
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
- Let go. Let go of me.
- No.

341
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,920
Let go. I said let go.

342
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
I won't.

343
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,720
You have to promise me first
that you won't run away again.

344
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,840
I'll have security drag you out.

345
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,760
- Let go.
- Go ahead.

346
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,800
Call the police if you want.
If you want publicity, call the press.

347
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,160
Ever since you ran away,

348
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,720
I have nothing left to lose.

349
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm sorry, Din.
I don't think I can go out to eat tonight.

350
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm dizzy.

351
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,320
I need to rest.

352
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,520
It's okay.

353
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,760
I'll order room service later.

354
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,040
Okay. Goodbye.

355
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,920
The baby…

356
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Is it my child?

357
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,360
No.

358
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,280
Din's the father.

359
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,080
How many months pregnant are you?

360
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,480
You're not answering.

361
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,360
Earlier, Din was busy with work

362
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
and constantly with Ms. Sarah.

363
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,040
More importantly, you were heartbroken.

364
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,320
Drinking yourself drunk
because he loved her.

365
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,760
So, how could you get pregnant by him?

366
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,159
Don't you remember

367
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,560
that night?

368
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,440
With the timeline and those reasons,

369
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,719
when exactly
could you have slept with Din?

370
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,880
This baby is not Din's.

371
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,440
Why are you doing this?!

372
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Believe it or not, that's up to you.

373
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,480
But the baby is Din's.

374
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
Not yours.

375
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,200
And when the child is born,

376
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,520
I'll tell them their father is Din.

377
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
Why?

378
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,720
Because a child deserves
to be born and raised with love.

379
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,360
At least I love Din.

380
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
Who he loves doesn't matter to me.

381
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,800
And I'm certain

382
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,440
he'll be a far better father
than someone like you.

383
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I won't accept that.

384
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,640
If this child is mine,

385
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,680
I will never let my child
call someone else Dad.

386
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,720
Even if you and I don't love each other,

387
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
the child has to call me Dad.

388
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
Let me go.

389
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm exhausted.

390
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,280
I'm begging you. I need to rest.

391
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,200
- You can't go in.
- Hey, I…

392
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,960
I have urgent business here.

393
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,200
I'm sorry. You can't enter.

394
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,360
This is important.

395
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,720
Everyone's off work already.

396
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,080
- Please let me in. This is important.
- No, ma'am. Please go back.

397
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
What's going on?

398
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,680
Ma'am.

399
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,600
She's here to see someone.

400
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,840
But it's after hours,
and all staff have already left.

401
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,600
So, I told her to come back tomorrow.

402
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,120
Tomorrow? I'm not that free.

403
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,040
I can't keep coming back and forth.

404
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,680
It's not even my business.

405
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,440
I only came out of goodwill, you know.

406
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,000
Who are you here to see?

407
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,880
You can leave a message with me.
I'll pass it on tomorrow.

408
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I don't know his name.

409
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,560
I just know he's Krong's son.

410
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,240
Krongthong.

411
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
And he works here.

412
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
<i>Why are you being nice to me?</i>

413
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,320
<i>I told you I never wanted you to be born.</i>

414
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
<i>I'm just doing what I should.</i>

415
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
Enough already!

416
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,240
I hereby resign from my position as CEO.

417
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,560
<i>You chose this yourself.</i>

418
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,920
You let imaginary grudges control you.
No reason, no self-control.

419
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
You acted like a rabid dog,
and look where that got you!

420
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
Just wait.

421
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
<i>Just wait.</i>

422
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,640
What? Nam was assaulted?

423
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
Chakrit…

424
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
It had to be Chakrit.

425
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,440
