1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,520
Why does he hate
the Phimarndech family so much?

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
<i>He doesn't hate the whole family.</i>

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
<i>Just one person.</i>

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,520
You're not being very nice.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,280
Always taking his side,
you like him or something?

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,160
<i>You shouldn't be out here</i>
<i>flirting around like this.</i>

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,560
-<i>Nina's starting to put pressure on us.</i>
-<i>I don't care.</i>

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,520
This one, I really like.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,840
<i>Fire that girl.</i>

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>If you won't fire her,</i>

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,000
then make sure Nam breaks up with her
and marries Nina as soon as possible.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,040
<i>You know they're Dad's enemies.</i>

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
<i>The fights of the older generation</i>
<i>should stay with the older generation.</i>

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
I'll never stop hating them,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,120
until we take back
the company they stole from us.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,840
Toy, this is Mr. Apo, my boss.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm Toy,

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,200
her ex-boyfriend.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,760
<i>I swear, the auntie who makes this</i>

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,880
<i>must've sold her soul to the devil</i>

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,680
for flavor that perfect,
right to this sissy's core! Super-spicy…

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,440
So, Mr. Toy is…

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,800
LGBTQ.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Come on, eat.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,280
About Toy…

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't mind him teasing you, okay?

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
At first, I was going to mind.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,080
But when I found out
he's actually your close friend,

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,120
not your ex,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
I felt a lot better.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
Right.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll be honest with you.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,640
I like you, Ms. Sarah.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
Since the first time I saw you.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
And I'd like to ask for a chance.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,440
Would you consider giving me one?

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,560
You're a sweet guy.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
But…

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,200
But what?

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
It's not you. It's me.

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm not ready.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,400
Right now, I want to focus on my work

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,800
and take better care of my family.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,240
That's okay. I won't rush you.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
As long as you don't mind,

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
I'll keep waiting

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,720
and keep proving myself to you.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Thank you.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,000
Mr. Din, your lunch is here.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Thanks.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Look at you.

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,160
It's Sunday. You should be home relaxing.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,480
But no, you're here,
working seven days a week.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
Take care of your health, okay?

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
There's plenty of time to rest later.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,600
Right now, I need
to find ways to cut expenses

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,240
and boost revenue as soon as possible.

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,840
You can go ahead, Uncle Perm.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,080
I'll stay and work tonight,
then head home after that.

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Why can't I ever win the lottery
as easily as I can predict this?

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,720
I knew you'd still be working late,

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,600
so I ordered an extra meal just in case.
Don't forget to eat, okay?

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,520
I worry about you. Good night.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,519
‎You're probably sleeping here, right?

65
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Please take care.

66
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,920
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,600
Finally done.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,120
A thief?

69
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,320
Stop right there, you thief!

70
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
I gave up my overtime,
and you attack me instead?

71
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
How was I supposed to know it was you?

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,040
Who comes to work on a Sunday?

73
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,640
And this late at night?

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Are you saying I'm weird?

75
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
That's not what I meant.

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,720
So…

77
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,000
What are you doing here anyway?

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Well, I just moved closer to the office.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,680
I was bored, didn't know what to do,
so I came in to work.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,240
You should be proud, actually.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Having such a dedicated employee like me.

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,760
Alright.

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay. I'm sorry
I almost hit you in the face.

84
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,520
I'll be more careful next time.

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Good.

86
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Anyway, I'm heading out.

87
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Wait.

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
I thought you'd be mad at me
and wouldn't come eat.

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,080
I am mad.

90
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,920
But I have to save money too.

91
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,600
By the way, you didn't know
I was here working, right?

92
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,520
Why'd you order two meals?

93
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,040
I actually ordered lunch
and dinner for myself,

94
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,920
but I got caught up working
and forgot to eat. So, lucky you.

95
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,440
Now I feel bad.

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,160
I basically stole one of your meals.

97
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,280
Anyway…

98
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Thanks again

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
for the free dinner.

100
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,000
But next time,

101
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,200
try eating on time, okay?
Take care of yourself a little.

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
Are you…

103
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,680
worried about me?

104
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
No.

105
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
It's called…

106
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
acting.

107
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,480
In case it gets me a raise.

108
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,560
My father suddenly needs a big lump sum.

109
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
Otherwise, you two

110
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,320
wouldn't be scrambling
to find the money like this.

111
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,280
It's no trouble.

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,640
If not now, we'd have had to do it
another day anyway.

113
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
That's a relief to hear.

114
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,720
Uh…

115
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,240
And Father asked me
to mention one more thing.

116
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,440
About the new loan we talked about,

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,760
he may want to reconsider.

118
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Is there a problem?

119
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
We've always paid the interest on time.

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,680
Honestly, Father told me not to say this,

121
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,360
but since we've known each other so long,

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,600
I'll tell you.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Your company
borrowed money from my father,

124
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,720
but there's no collateral.

125
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Even if we're close,

126
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,960
he still has to be cautious.

127
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,880
You know what they say,

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,960
money cuts deeper than a knife.

129
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,640
It can even sever relationships.

130
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,520
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

131
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
Goodbye. Goodbye.

132
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,960
Do you know how humiliating it was for me

133
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,880
to pawn my jewelry
just to cover your interest payment?

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
And look at you.

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
You can't get a single thing done.

136
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
Can't secure another loan.

137
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Can't even get Nam to marry Nina.

138
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,800
What can I rely on you for, huh?

139
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Or how about this?

140
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
Go get that girl yourself,
beat Nam to it, and end this mess.

141
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
This is real life, Mom,

142
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,320
not some K-drama
where everything's that complicated.

143
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
Then listen to me.

144
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,640
If you run PD into the ground,

145
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
don't say I didn't warn you.

146
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Oh, Nina.

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
-Oh, Nam!
-What are you doing here?

148
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm here on my father's business.

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
Are you free today?

150
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
-Let's get lunch. I know a place--
-Uh, not today.

151
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,040
I've got to go discuss something
with Ms. Sarah.

152
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh, I see.

153
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
Catch you later then.

154
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,040
Mhm.

155
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,240
So, you're that stressed,
you had to take it out on me?

156
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,800
Let me guess. This is about Nam.

157
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
You know me.

158
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,040
I don't get it.
What's so great about that guy?

159
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,320
Why are you so dead set on him?

160
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm way better than he is,

161
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,600
especially at…

162
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,640
If you're good at that with
everyone else, I'm out. Hard pass.

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,600
If marriage means constantly stressing

164
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,720
over who my man's shacking up with today,

165
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
ugh, headache.

166
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,080
So, why'd you call me here?

167
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
What do you want?

168
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,800
I need your advice.

169
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Don't you want to know

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,760
what the girl Nam's crazy about
looks like?

171
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,040
So, you mean…

172
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,240
you want me to go after her or…

173
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,600
destroy her?

174
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
Figure out

175
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,080
which one would please me more.

176
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,960
-As discussed, alright?
-Yes.

177
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,320
Do you have a minute? I want to talk.

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,840
Since when do you just
open someone's door and walk in?

179
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,880
Can we talk now?

180
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,680
Uncle Perm, proceed as discussed.

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,480
Keep me posted.

182
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,920
Yes, Mr. Din.

183
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,480
Knock, knock.

184
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
You wanted to talk?

185
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,800
This is the new product.

186
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,960
An affordable gift set for office workers,

187
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,360
easy to carry,
with full benefits, sun protection,

188
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,120
and facial care.

189
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,520
After our talk last night, I got inspired,

190
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,720
so I made a tester.

191
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,040
This formula uses low-cost ingredients,

192
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,360
but the quality matches, or even beats,

193
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,760
what you've got in the lineup now.

194
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
-You came up with a formula in one night?
-Mhm.

195
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,400
Of course. Who do you think I am?

196
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm Sarah.

197
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,960
Are you sure it actually works?

198
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
That's why I want you to test it yourself.

199
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,840
With your delicate, pampered,
super-sensitive skin,

200
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
you're the perfect little test subject.

201
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,680
-Come here.
-Hey.

202
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't panic.

203
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,480
I swear on my own head
you won't have an allergic reaction.

204
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
Oh!

205
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
Hey, you!

206
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,320
What a mess!

207
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,760
Ugh.

208
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,040
Let me help.

209
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Where are they?

210
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,560
Krit, you never told me why you wanted me

211
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,920
to come along today.

212
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
I heard their new R&amp;D hire is really good,

213
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,040
so I wanted to meet her myself.
Maybe we'll work together someday.

214
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
Work together?

215
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,920
With you?

216
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,720
Why not?

217
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,280
I've already bought
a fair chunk of shares here.

218
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,320
One day, I'll buy the whole company.

219
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,440
Think of it as the future owner
doing an early site visit.

220
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Hey.

221
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,400
Mr. Din?

222
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,240
Are you reacting to the cream?
Can you breathe?

223
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
No reaction.

224
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,920
But it absorbed fast and felt so mellow.

225
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,160
So, I was kinda…
mellowing right into sleep.

226
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
You.

227
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
You think that's funny?

228
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,920
So, how is it? Okay?

229
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,880
Yeah, feels good. I feel like

230
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,920
my skin's soft,
and there's no itch at all.

231
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,920
And that's just the cream.

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,280
There's a serum too, and let me tell you…

233
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,920
It's fabulous.

234
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,160
This one's quick-absorb too.

235
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
That's the idea.

236
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,760
Din.

237
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
Can we talk?

238
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,840
You're trying to wind me up,
getting that close to Ms. Sarah?

239
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
Hey. Calm down, Nam.

240
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,480
We were just testing products, that's all.

241
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,880
Testing, huh?
You really think I'm that stupid?

242
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,120
Just admit it, you like her.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,280
<i>Go get that girl yourself, beat Nam to it,</i>

244
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
<i>and end this mess.</i>

245
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,520
Yeah.

246
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,440
I like Ms. Sarah.

247
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Din!

248
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,320
What?

249
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,920
You're the only one allowed to like her?

250
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
I like her too.

251
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,640
And I'm going to pursue her.

252
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,120
Well…

253
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,040
We were just…

254
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
messing around like brothers do.

255
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
Right, Din?

256
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,960
Right.

257
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
You two sure joke harshly.

258
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
But when I said I like you,

259
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
I wasn't joking.

260
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
I'll get back to work.

261
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,360
Wait, Ms. Sarah.

262
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
I may not flirt as smooth as you,

263
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,080
but making a woman uncomfortable,

264
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
that's just dumb.

265
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,640
-Hey.
-Let go, Krit.

266
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,320
-Come on.
-Let go.

267
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,520
Let me go, Krit. Let go.

268
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,960
Let me go, Krit. It hurts!

269
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,040
Krit, why are you dragging me out?

270
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,000
You said you were here
to talk business with Din?

271
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,160
Even if I did come because of Din,

272
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm not letting you chase after him.

273
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
And why not?

274
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
You still don't get it?

275
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,400
If you go to him
right after what just happened,

276
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,160
what's that gonna look like?

277
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,320
Jealousy is written all over your face.

278
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,040
Because you hate

279
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,560
that Din's into someone else.

280
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,800
Am I right?

281
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,680
You're overthinking it.

282
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
Morning, Ms. Sarah.

283
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,840
Morning, Mr. Nam.

284
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
Did you want to talk about something?

285
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,520
I was wondering

286
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,680
if I should tell you this.

287
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,200
Tell me what?

288
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,280
If it's that you like me,
no need to repeat it.

289
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,080
I got the message.

290
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,120
It's not that.

291
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,560
My mom wants me to marry someone,

292
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,680
and it affects
whether the company survives.

293
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,200
But…

294
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,920
But I'm not into her.

295
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
And about Din trying to go after you,

296
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
I can see through it.

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,880
He wants me to give up on you,

298
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,760
so I'll go marry that girl instead.

299
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,520
Well,

300
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,200
what I told you just now, Ms. Sarah,

301
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,800
I only wanted you to know the whole truth.

302
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
So you'd also know

303
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,320
that I'm sincere,

304
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,520
and I'm serious about you.

305
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,840
If you'd just give me a chance,

306
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,040
could you open your heart to me?

307
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
I should go to work.

308
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
Please go ahead.

309
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
Thank you.

310
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
-Hey, calm down.
-Calm down.

311
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,120
Did you even read the script?

312
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,240
We've done eight takes.
How can you say I didn't?

313
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,280
You're just biased.

314
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,680
Before you call me biased,
did you even understand the role?

315
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,440
Nueng said the lead has to be furious.

316
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,760
I am furious.

317
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,400
Still not enough for you?!

318
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,000
How mad do you want?

319
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,640
Angry is one thing,
but the character needs to be hurt too.

320
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
He's never hit a woman.
The moment he does, it crushes him.

321
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,400
And what is this?
Eight takes and not a shred of remorse.

322
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,680
If I can't ask whether you read it,
what can I ask?!

323
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,240
-What?
-Hey, hold up.

324
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
What? Your acting sucks.

325
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,040
And you want to pick fights?

326
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,920
-Go on then, hit me.
-Bring it.

327
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,440
Guys, cool it!

328
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,200
We're friends.
What's the point of fighting?

329
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
Alright, 15-minute break.
We'll shoot again after.

330
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

331
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,000
You do it.

332
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,840
-You go.
-Come on. Hurry up.

333
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,680
Here, have some water.

334
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
Say what you've got to say.

335
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
Well…

336
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,080
It's about Rach.

337
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,560
You know his dream is to be a director.

338
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
That's why he gets too serious.

339
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
Yeah.

340
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,600
He probably regrets snapping at you.

341
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,760
Let us apologize on his behalf, okay?

342
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,440
-Please?
-Come on, Yo.

343
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,200
-It's nothing.
-We're friends, right?

344
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,520
Fine, I get it.

345
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,600
I actually messed up too.
My acting wasn't great.

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,040
Made everyone waste time
with all those takes.

347
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,280
I'll talk to him myself.

348
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,160
Damn it!

349
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,720
Sorry, Cherry.

350
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,360
No need to apologize.

351
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,760
Hey… Are you okay?

352
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
I'll be, once the shoot's done.

353
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm worried and…

354
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm worried

355
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,760
because…

356
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,800
I like you, Sarach.

357
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
Let's talk about this later.

358
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,000
We should get back to work.

359
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,320
<i>I'll make you like me back,</i>

360
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,920
<i>Sarach.</i>

361
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Smells nice. Lotion?

362
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,480
First things first.

363
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,200
Why are you here?

364
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Tomorrow,

365
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,160
you're coming into the field with me.

366
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,680
What?

367
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,080
Not even old yet
and already hard of hearing?

368
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,160
Why do I have to go?

369
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm visiting the community enterprise
you recommended.

370
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
If you don't come,
who am I supposed to go with?

371
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,360
What are you wearing?

372
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
I should be asking you that.

373
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
Does your closet

374
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
have anything besides work suits?

375
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,120
What?

376
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm going to work.

377
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,080
You're the one

378
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,800
dressed for the savanna.

379
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,800
Planning to ride a lion?

380
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,160
You said we're going into the field.

381
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
I dressed to get my hands dirty.

382
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,920
Suit yourself. So, please.

383
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,680
Go hop on your lion then.

384
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh, Mom.

385
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,920
Din's not home yet?

386
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,480
Not yet.

387
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Is something wrong? It's late.

388
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

389
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
You'll see when he gets back.

390
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,560
You're tired.
Go shower and get some sleep.

391
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,320
Stop worrying about everyone else.

392
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
But…

393
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,720
Thanks for keeping me company
the whole way today.

394
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,760
It's alright.
That's what travel buddies are for.

395
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Anyway, you've had a long day.

396
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,320
Go shower and get some rest.
I won't bother you.

397
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,920
And you…

398
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,160
Drive safe, okay?

399
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,560
I will.

400
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,280
Hello?

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Dad?

402
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,000
How is he?

403
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
He's stable now.

404
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
-Dad.
-Sara…

405
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,840
You called her, didn't you?

406
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,880
I told you there was no need.

407
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,800
Yeah, I got busted.

408
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,840
Dad, don't scold him.

409
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,280
It's just us.
Of course we tell each other.

410
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,880
Alright.

411
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,520
Mr. Din.

412
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,320
It really is you.

413
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,680
It's been, what, ten years?

414
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,560
Even when you came to our house,
we missed each other.

415
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Didn't think you'd remember me.

416
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,840
Of course I do.

417
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Sarach, did you greet him?

418
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,080
I did.

419
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,600
Din.

420
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,160
You've grown up, huh?

421
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,760
What?

422
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,960
You look like you just hit
the jackpot, Moopook.

423
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,280
You know who I am?

424
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,720
Since when?

425
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,560
-Easy, Moopook.
-Hey.

426
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,560
Don't call me that.

427
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,360
Since I saw your full name
on the application.

428
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,600
<i>It's been a while.</i>

429
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,920
<i>You look completely different.</i>

430
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,120
Please bring her in for the interview.

431
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,480
Sure.

432
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,000
<i>But when you said your name was Sarah,</i>

433
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,800
<i>I hesitated.</i>

434
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,000
Could've been someone with a similar name.

435
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,239
And…

436
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,239
How were you sure it was me?

437
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
When we got stuck in the elevator.

438
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,560
Hey. Are you okay?

439
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,719
I…

440
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm claustrophobic.

441
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,199
<i>You haven't changed a bit.</i>

442
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Hey,

443
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,440
if you knew from the start,
why didn't you say something?

444
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,360
You knew too and stayed quiet.

445
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,639
Wait, wait.

446
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,360
So,

447
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,520
you're working with Mr. Din now?

448
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,400
Yes, Uncle.

449
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,360
Your daughter's diligent,
hardworking, and smart.

450
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
She won't let you down.

451
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,640
Good.

452
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,600
Working with someone we know

453
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,560
puts me at ease.

454
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,960
Sara,

455
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,520
why didn't you tell me about this?

456
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,600
How long were you planning
to hide that you knew me?

457
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,520
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

458
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,880
Hey, don't turn it back on me.

459
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,200
Just being honest.

460
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,280
Update me on what
the doctor says tomorrow.

461
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,600
With respect,
I won't report personal matters.

462
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,440
I'm not asking for a report.

463
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,000
Just keep me in the loop.
I worry about Uncle Suthee too.

464
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,120
Can you not argue with me for once?

465
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,920
Can you just listen and do it?

466
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
-Hey--
-Ah!

467
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,640
This is a hospital. Keep it down.

468
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,920
Bye-bye.

469
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,360
Make yourself at home, Nina. Don't be shy.

470
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,640
Thank you.

471
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,880
Warms the heart, doesn't it?

472
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Like newlyweds.

473
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,040
Auntie…

474
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,600
Eat up, dear.

475
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,520
Honestly, I do this
for all my female friends.

476
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,760
A lot of couples start as friends

477
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,720
and end up together.

478
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,040
Well, you're not wrong.

479
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,240
If they haven't met the right one yet.

480
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,880
But once they have,

481
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,440
friends should stay just friends.

482
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,760
Thank you for breakfast.

483
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,360
It's nothing.

484
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,160
Come by every day if you like.
Keep me company.

485
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,280
Depends if I get anything in return.

486
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,800
The loan

487
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
and the shares you asked about,

488
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,080
it's all investment.

489
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,120
If it turns into a sunk cost

490
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,120
or the return isn't worth it,

491
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,240
I can't exactly
persuade my father to help.

492
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,520
You understand me, right, Auntie?

493
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
I do.

494
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I'll be going now.

495
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,080
Yesterday,
I took Ms. Sarah out to the field.

496
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
The car broke down, we got caught
in the rain, came back late.

497
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,840
-End of story.
-Work excuses again.

498
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,560
You spent the whole day with her,
till late at night.

499
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,560
Don't think I can't read you.

500
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
You're such a cheat.

501
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,280
If you're gonna go after Ms. Sarah,

502
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,560
at least play fair.

503
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,800
You really like her that much, huh?

504
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,400
You already know. Why even ask?

505
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,840
So, what is it you like about her?

506
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Her looks? Her brains? Her job?

507
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,680
Everything about her.

508
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
Then let me tell you something.

509
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Sarah, or Sara,

510
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,720
is that pimple-faced,
thick-browed, tick-chinned girl,

511
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,160
the daughter of Uncle Suthee,
you used to look down on.

512
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,680
<i>-Give it back!</i>
-Does Sara have a crush on Nam?

513
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,560
-Give it!
-You pimple-faced, thick-browed,

514
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,000
dog tick on your chin!

515
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,040
-Be a couple!
-Give it back!

516
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,040
<i>Give it…</i>

517
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,440
Let's play dolls!

518
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Dolls? Ugh, so annoying.

519
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,400
Who'd even want to play with you?

520
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,880
Here, this is to make up
for the other day.

521
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,040
What are you plotting now?

522
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,080
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

523
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,800
<i>Why'd you bring that woman back</i>
<i>to see Din?</i>

524
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,480
I just told her
to go check on him, that's all.

525
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,440
<i>Your father's muscular heart disease</i>

526
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,400
<i>has been getting worse, and right now,</i>

527
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,760
<i>it's reached a critical stage.</i>

528
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,400
<i>But I can help you. It's just that…</i>

529
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
You'll have to marry me.

530
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,280
