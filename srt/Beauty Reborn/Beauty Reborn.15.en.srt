1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>Why is the house so quiet today?</i>

2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,000
<i>Your dear brother Din got Baicha pregnant.</i>

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,000
<i>So Sara packed up and went back home.</i>

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,840
<i>If this child is mine,</i>

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,080
<i>I will never let my child</i>
<i>call someone else Dad.</i>

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Let me go.

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm begging you.

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,240
If I can't kill you all outright,

9
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,480
I'll make you suffer while you're alive.

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
<i>Who are you here to see?</i>

11
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,920
<i>I don't know his name.</i>

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,919
I just know he's Krongthong's son.

13
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,320
Hey, what happened?

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
What's wrong with my mom?

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Your mother had a TIA.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
A transient ischemic attack.

17
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,280
But the doctor says she'll recover soon.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,880
Thank you so much

19
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,720
for bringing my mom to the hospital
and staying to look after her.

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,440
It's just something
that needed to be done, isn't it?

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
I know that she doesn't
want anything to do with you,

22
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,600
but when she's sick, I'm sure

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
you'd never abandon her.

24
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,560
So you stepped in and did my part.

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,600
Like a…

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
a nurse…

27
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
You don't need to dance around it.

28
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,480
I was doing my duty
as her daughter-in-law.

29
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,120
But once we divorce,

30
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,520
you'll need to find someone else
to take care of her.

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,680
Sara…

32
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,400
I should head home now. It's late.

33
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
Then let me drive you home.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm going back to Dad's place.

35
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
Well, it's pretty late.

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Why don't you just stay here tonight, Din?

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,920
Dad.

38
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,000
He already drove me home.
Why make him stay?

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,680
Besides, it's probably
inconvenient for him.

40
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,600
- I'm fine with it.
- See? He says it's fine.

41
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,280
But Dad…

42
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,160
Come on. Be considerate.

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,320
It's already late,
and he drove all this way.

44
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,360
Driving back again would exhaust him.

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
That's true. I am pretty tired and sleepy.

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm worried I might get
into an accident if I drive back.

47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,800
Then go ahead and take a shower.

48
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
I'll prepare some clothes for you.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Thank you.

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
Dad.

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
Dad.

52
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,040
Why does he have to sleep in my room?

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
Sarach is already asleep,

54
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,680
and my room is too small.

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Two people would be uncomfortable.

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
My room isn't that big either.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
Well, still bigger than mine.

58
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,400
Come on. It's just one night.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,320
It's late. Go to sleep,
you two. I'll go now.

60
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Dad, wait… Dad!

61
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,120
Hey, hey.

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,720
- Wait.
- Huh?

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
What are you doing?

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,240
Going to sleep.

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,760
On the floor.
Blankets and pillows are in the closet.

66
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Help yourself.

67
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,160
This space is tiny.
I'll be really uncomfortable.

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,040
I should sleep on the bed instead.

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey.

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,160
- Hey, hey!
- Whoa!

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Seriously…

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Do you want to sleep on the floor nicely
or pass out on the floor?

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,320
Your choice.

74
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Honestly, I kind of like
sleeping on the floor.

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,400
It's actually pretty comfortable.

76
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,560
Hey, that thing's
really powerful, you know?

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
Let me put this here for a bit.

78
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,360
Hey.

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,600
- Sorry, sorry.
- Don't sneak up on me like that.

80
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,640
If I had a heart attack,
you'd be the first one I'd haunt.

81
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,080
So… what are you doing here?

82
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,400
To see my baby.

83
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
I already told you.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,040
The baby is Din's, not yours.

85
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Then… I'm here to see my niece or nephew.

86
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
Are you arguing that too?

87
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh, right.

88
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,880
Have you started prenatal care?

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,840
Not yet. Why?

90
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
‪PHARMACY

91
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,240
All done.

92
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
These are supplements.

93
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,720
Take them on time.

94
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,280
And this is your appointment card
for next time.

95
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,640
Fine. So you're not going to talk?

96
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,360
My dear nibling…

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,840
If your mom's this stubborn,
you'll need to be patient.

98
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
Get up right now.

99
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,320
Hey, wait, I'm talking to my nibling.

100
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,120
My dear nibling…

101
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,840
Hang in there a little longer.
Your mom will grow up soon, okay?

102
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,440
- Hey.
- What?

103
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm talking to my nibling.

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,160
‪COUPLE CHECKUP PROGRAM

105
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,840
My dear nibling… What's that?

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,240
Really?

107
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Right? Your mom still hasn't grown up.

108
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,840
Let me hear that again.
Okay, let me listen.

109
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,720
The test results are out.

110
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,920
The doctor says there's nothing serious.
He's prescribed medication.

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
But you'll need to follow
a controlled diet as instructed.

112
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,800
Why did you help me?

113
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,760
Don't expect me to thank you.

114
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,640
You did this on your own.

115
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm just doing what I should.

116
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Even if you don't see me as your son…

117
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,240
when you're sick,

118
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

119
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,440
Enough already!

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Do you have any idea how bad it feels

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,160
for a mother who abandoned her child,

122
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,600
only to have him come back
and take care of her?

123
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,160
All this time, the reason
I never went to see you

124
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,400
was because I didn't
want to feel this way.

125
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,400
Guilty. Like a terrible person.

126
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
Mom.

127
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,360
I've already forgiven you.

128
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,120
You should forgive yourself too.

129
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,160
From now on, unless
it's absolutely necessary,

130
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,120
I won't contact you again.

131
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,080
The person you should
really be taking care of

132
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,200
is Namnuan.

133
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
Namnuan, my stepmother?

134
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Think about it carefully.

135
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,360
She raised you until you grew up.

136
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,840
She gave you everything
a child should have.

137
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
As your real mother,

138
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,280
what did I ever give you? Nothing.

139
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
But…

140
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,240
But she doesn't love me.

141
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
Even if she doesn't love you,

142
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,240
she's the only one who raised you.

143
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,760
She devoted everything to you…

144
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,040
even though she never had to.

145
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,400
Alright.

146
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,320
That concludes today's meeting.

147
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,200
I have an important announcement to make.

148
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,840
I've been serving as CEO
of PD Group for a while now,

149
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,240
and during my time in this role,
I've realized

150
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,920
this position doesn't suit me.

151
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,880
I hereby

152
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,920
resign from my position as CEO.

153
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,920
And I appoint Mr. Chakrit

154
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,320
to assume the position
effective immediately.

155
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,800
Congratulations.

156
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,040
PD is in your hands now.

157
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,480
Why say it like that?

158
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,880
I'll still be relying on you, Din.

159
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,200
From now on, you will work with Nina.

160
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
You want me to work with Nina?

161
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,880
Yes. While Nina is in the U.S.,

162
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,280
you'll have the same authority as her.

163
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,040
Please look after her.

164
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,800
She's still very inexperienced.

165
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
You already have Chakrit.

166
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,600
I don't think I'm necessary.

167
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Two heads are better than one.
This is all for PD.

168
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,120
You want to see PD thrive too, don't you?

169
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,800
Please excuse me.

170
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,720
What is this supposed to mean?
Why would you do this?

171
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,440
Having Din work with Nina,

172
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,960
isn't that the same
as having him work for us?

173
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Chakrit is trying to take Din down.

174
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,520
That's exactly why I have to help Din.

175
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,080
Don't you feel it? Chakrit's
getting more arrogant every day.

176
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,360
Now that he's the CEO,
he'll think he's untouchable.

177
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,560
I won't let him control everything.

178
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Let them keep each other in check.

179
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,240
That way, we benefit.

180
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
Nam.

181
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,079
If you want to yell at me, go ahead.

182
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I know what I did was wrong.

183
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,440
If you want to hit me, I'll accept it.

184
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
That's not what this is about.

185
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,119
Sara and I,

186
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
we need to talk to you.

187
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
Ms. Sarah?

188
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's take a walk, one or two laps.

189
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,360
Pregnant women
are supposed to keep moving,

190
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,200
exercise regularly, so they stay healthy.

191
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,560
Thank you so much, Din,
for taking care of me.

192
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
Hello?

193
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,880
What?

194
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,560
Nam was assaulted?

195
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,280
Chakrit. It had to be Chakrit.

196
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Nam!

197
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
Nam!

198
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,720
Nam, what happened to you?

199
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,920
Where are you hurt? Wake up!

200
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wake up, Nam. Talk to me.

201
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
You're really sly
and calculating, aren't you?

202
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,520
If you hadn't backed me up,

203
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
I wouldn't have pulled it off.

204
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,720
<i>Here's the real problem</i>
<i>with Ms. Baicha right now.</i>

205
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,960
<i>She thinks Mr. Nam doesn't love her,</i>
<i>that he doesn't want her.</i>

206
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Is that so?

207
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,520
Believe me, speaking as a woman,

208
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,120
when women overthink things,
they become insecure and easily hurt.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,760
<i>And with pregnancy hormones,</i>
<i>it's even worse.</i>

210
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,440
So, in the end, it all comes down to you.

211
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
What you choose to do.

212
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,080
I love Baicha.

213
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,560
I love her as a friend,

214
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,080
as my significant other,
and as the mother of my child.

215
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
I just didn't realize it before.

216
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,600
But once everything happened,

217
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,760
I knew.

218
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,120
I realized I was afraid of losing her,

219
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,640
afraid she'd disappear from my life.

220
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,960
<i>Then that means</i>

221
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,400
<i>you both feel the same way.</i>

222
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,600
I have a plan.

223
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,680
You still have the nerve to blame me?

224
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,040
Honestly,

225
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
if you hadn't been sure
and helped confirm it, would I have dared?

226
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,080
I love Baicha like my own little sister.

227
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,960
So whatever I do,
I have to think it through.

228
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,600
If something went wrong,
it would only hurt her more.

229
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
Nam…

230
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,920
Nam…

231
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
Nam!

232
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,720
Baicha…

233
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Let go. Let go of me.

234
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,120
I said let go, you liar!

235
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,080
Let go.

236
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,360
I told you, call me "dear."

237
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,480
Nam, let go!

238
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,720
Say it. Call me "dear."

239
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,160
Or this time, it won't just be your cheek.

240
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,440
I love you, Baicha.

241
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
I don't know when it started.

242
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
But once I found out you were pregnant,

243
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,360
there wasn't a single second
I regretted it.

244
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
I was only worried.

245
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,640
When I realized you'd disappeared,
I nearly lost my mind.

246
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,160
That's when I knew

247
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,560
I'd do anything not to lose you.

248
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
There, there.

249
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,440
Don't cry.

250
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,440
I'm sorry.

251
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,720
I know I hurt you.

252
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,720
But at the time, Baicha
threatened to have an abortion.

253
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Chakrit was furious,
and I was afraid he'd hurt Nam.

254
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,800
So, I had no choice

255
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,160
but to take responsibility
as the child's father.

256
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Sara.

257
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
I wanted to explain everything to you,

258
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,240
but…

259
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,880
I hesitated.

260
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,360
I was worried about Nam and Baicha,
afraid the company would be damaged.

261
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,280
So…

262
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,160
I chose to stay silent.

263
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,360
I thought I'd talk to you
once everything settled down.

264
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,280
But it only hurt you.

265
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
Please forgive me.

266
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,280
You chose to do this

267
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,800
because you weren't confident in me.

268
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,720
You didn't trust that I could stand by you
through everything.

269
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,200
You hid the truth from me

270
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,640
and carried everything on your own.

271
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,560
So…

272
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
I can't forgive you.

273
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,520
Sara…

274
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,240
Mom, we've already
registered our marriage.

275
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
You're legally married?

276
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,120
What is all this?

277
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
Mom.

278
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,000
My child will have to call you "grandma."

279
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,960
Your child? Isn't the baby Din's?

280
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,840
No.

281
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Din only took responsibility on my behalf.

282
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,080
But I won't run away anymore.

283
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,480
I want to take responsibility
for my wife and my child.

284
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
Please give us your blessing.

285
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,640
Please take care of me, Auntie.

286
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,960
What is this nonsense?
Have you lost your mind, Nam?

287
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,560
Everything we're dealing with right now,

288
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,800
isn't it all because of Chakrit?

289
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,400
And now you go and marry his sister?

290
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,520
Mom, Baicha may be Krit's sister,

291
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,240
but the baby she's carrying
is my child, your grandchild.

292
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
Mom,

293
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,160
things have gone this far already.

294
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Please don't be angry anymore. Alright?

295
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
I won't accept this.

296
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,840
What a model big brother you are.

297
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,640
If you're going to be the father,
why not see it through?

298
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,080
Mom, we're one family.

299
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,920
When there's a problem, we work
through it and support each other,

300
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,560
not make things worse
or pile on more trouble.

301
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,760
Are you saying I'm the problem?

302
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,320
Didn't the company end up like this
because of your poor decisions?

303
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,080
If you'd held my hand tight back then,

304
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
we wouldn't be here today.

305
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
The same goes for Nam.

306
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,400
Do you really think what you're doing

307
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
will make things better?

308
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,320
You're pushing your own children
and grandchildren away.

309
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,320
But Baicha is Chakrit's sister.

310
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,320
They're two different people.

311
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,920
We shouldn't take one generation's
problems out on the next.

312
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,320
Otherwise, we're no different
from Chakrit.

313
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,960
Mom.

314
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Baicha.

315
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,080
Fine.

316
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,360
You're Nam's wife now, so you're family.

317
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Take good care of yourself,
for the baby's sake.

318
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,760
Thank you, Mom.

319
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Hm. What about Chakrit?

320
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,640
He won't cause trouble for you two, right?

321
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,600
Baicha and I already texted him
and told him everything.

322
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,360
He hasn't responded yet.

323
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,040
Increase capital and list
the shares on the exchange?

324
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,200
Yes. Funding isn't a problem for me.

325
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,880
PD needs to move forward.

326
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
But none of us has cash
anywhere near yours.

327
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
Even if we inject more capital,

328
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,200
we still can't buy
enough shares to compete.

329
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,280
The shares I hold would lose
their power immediately.

330
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,960
Then sell them.

331
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,680
Use the IPO window

332
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
and make a big profit.

333
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,440
You're an investor type anyway.

334
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,120
I don't need to teach you that.

335
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
And my authority as CEO?

336
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,120
No need to overthink it.

337
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,720
Just do your job and follow my orders.

338
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,360
Oh, one more thing.

339
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,640
Din agrees with this.

340
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,760
Din!

341
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Are you stupid or crazy,
taking Praphop's side?

342
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
Not calling him "sir" anymore?

343
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,920
What you're doing will hurt you too.

344
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So what? What can I even do right now?

345
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,800
Isn't this on you?

346
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,040
You wanted PD for revenge. Did you get it?

347
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,240
You wanted Phimarndech to fall.
Did it go the way you hoped?

348
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,200
In the end, it's you

349
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,400
who became a pawn in their game.

350
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,360
We're here because you
chose this yourself.

351
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
You let imaginary grudges control you.

352
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,120
No reason, no self-control.

353
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
You acted like a rabid dog,
and look where that got you!

354
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,120
Din, listen to me.

355
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
Someone like me

356
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,840
won't lose to you or Praphop.

357
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,960
Just wait. Just wait.

358
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,880
Hello. What can I get--

359
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,360
What is it?

360
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,520
He won't dare do anything right now.

361
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,199
Why are you acting like that, Nam?

362
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm just here to see my sister
and my unborn nibling.

363
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,360
Hi, Baicha.

364
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,520
How are you?

365
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,159
I'm fine, Krit.

366
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,640
You promised you'd let Baicha go
if I helped you become CEO.

367
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,840
Wow. Cutting me off before I even speak.

368
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm a man of my word.
You don't need to worry.

369
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,840
But today, I'm here
to talk about something else.

370
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,640
If it's about taking PD public, I'm out.

371
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,120
Not just that, everything at PD.

372
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,160
Right now, I'm focusing
on Baicha and the baby.

373
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,960
I won't stop you from that,

374
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,840
but I want you to think about the future.

375
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,080
The baby Baicha's carrying
is my niece or nephew too.

376
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,040
If we keep the company, one day,
it'll belong to your child anyway.

377
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,720
Belong to my child?

378
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,880
You hate me and Din this much.

379
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,640
Even if it's your blood, if it carries
our name, you'd never give it up.

380
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,480
You're just looking for allies because
Uncle Praphop is taking your power.

381
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,120
Nam.

382
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,560
Go home. I won't
let you use my child as a tool.

383
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,640
They deserve the freedom
to choose their own life,

384
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,680
not to carry anyone's expectations
or ambitions.

385
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,200
Nam, you're so damn stupid.

386
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,960
Can you come into the office this morning?

387
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,320
Our partner wants to congratulate us
on the sales surge.

388
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,160
I have to take my dad to the doctor.
I'll come in this afternoon.

389
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,680
What a shame. You're a key part of this.

390
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,680
Then give me a raise.

391
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,560
Seriously…

392
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,160
Alright. Take your dad to the doctor.
We'll meet this afternoon.

393
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,360
Talk to you later.

394
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
<i>Hold on.</i>

395
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,080
Yes?

396
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I missed you.

397
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,560
Our key man has arrived!

398
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,200
Come on, Din. Here, take the flowers.

399
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,120
Here, our guest made the trip specially.

400
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,880
Congratulations on the sales,
Mr. Pathawee.

401
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,320
Thank you very much.

402
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,440
Alright, let's take a photo.
Please, please.

403
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,080
This way. Please stand closer.

404
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,720
Smile, cheese!

405
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,400
I came to talk about a raise--

406
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,400
He's not here?

407
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,640
Why aren't you answering?

408
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,080
You disappear without saying a word.

409
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,880
Uncle?

410
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,760
Uncle!

411
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,360
Uncle, can you hear me?

412
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,480
<i>This is brutal.</i>

413
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,400
Praphop is in a coma.

414
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,920
<i>I've gone over the timeline carefully.</i>

415
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,680
<i>There's a very strong possibility</i>

416
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,840
that I was…

417
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,000
Drugged.

418
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,880
<i>We have evidence from CCTV footage.</i>

419
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,840
<i>It clearly shows the last person</i>
<i>with Mr. Praphop was you.</i>

420
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,960
<i>If you ever fall,</i>

421
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,920
<i>I'll sit right by your side,</i>

422
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,040
<i>until you're back on your feet.</i>

423
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,080
You!

424
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,400
Who sent you?

425
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,360
