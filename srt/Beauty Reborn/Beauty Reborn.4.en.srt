1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,840
<i>I'm worried because…</i>

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
<i>I like you, Sarach.</i>

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>Mr. Din, It really is you.</i>

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,400
<i>It's been, what, ten years?</i>

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
<i>Didn't think you'd remember me.</i>

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>If you knew from the start,</i>
<i>why didn't you say something?</i>

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>You knew too and stayed quiet.</i>

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>Don't you want to know what the girl</i>
<i>Nam's crazy about looks like?</i>

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>So, you mean, you want me</i>
<i>to go after her or destroy her?</i>

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,240
Figure out which one would please me more.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,640
<i>Do you know how humiliating it was for me</i>

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,080
<i>to pawn my jewelry</i>
<i>just to cover your interest payment?</i>

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,160
And look at you.
You can't get a single thing done.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,920
If you run PD into the ground,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,040
don't say I didn't warn you.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>You really like her that much, huh?</i>

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
<i>You know, why even ask?</i>

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>Then let me tell you something.</i>

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>Sarah, or Sara,</i>

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,720
is that pimple-faced,
thick-browed, tick-chinned girl,

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,760
the daughter of Uncle Suthee,
you used to look down on.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>Once the family decides</i>
<i>about the surgery, please let me know.</i>

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
Sara.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Yes, Dad?

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,880
Get me some water.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh, sure.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,800
Mr. Nam?

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
Hello, Uncle.

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,560
You've really grown up, Mr. Nam.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,040
I came as soon as Din
told me what happened.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,040
Thank you, but you didn't
have to trouble yourself.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,960
I wanted to.

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840
Excuse me. I'm here
to take Mr. Suthee for a blood test.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,160
-Let's go, Dad.
-Oh, it's fine.

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,680
Stay here and chat with Mr. Nam.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,680
I'll be right back.

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,320
Okay.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,320
-Yes.
-This way, please.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,560
Well…

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Ms. Sarah,

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,880
I wanted to apologize for everything
I did to you when we were kids.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
It's alright. That was a long time ago.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
But I really do feel bad.

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Can you forgive me?

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
I've already forgotten about it.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,880
It was just a bad childhood memory.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,200
But it wasn't all bad, you know.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
It made me stronger.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Made me who I am today.

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
The more you say that, the worse I feel.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm over it.

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,840
It doesn't affect me anymore,

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,280
so please don't worry.

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
Thank you.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,200
Hearing you say that
makes me feel a lot better.

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,680
If it's possible,

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,520
could I have a chance
to make it up to you?

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,560
Din already has a head start on me.

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,760
And now he's even further ahead
because of this.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
What do you mean?

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,320
I mean, Din's always been nice to you.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,240
Hey! Nam, give that back!

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Let's see. Who's this love letter for?

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
Give it back!

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
"Don't cry, okay?

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,200
Everyone's got strengths and flaws.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Don't give up. Keep your spirits up.
I'm rooting for you."

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,440
Reading someone else's letter? That's bad!

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
Huh?

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,760
Why do you even care about that ugly girl?

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
She's just staying at our house.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,640
You've done wrong and still aren't sorry?
Dad didn't raise us like that.

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,840
We don't get to choose how we're born.
I'm sure she didn't want to be that way.

75
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,960
Think about it. If you were her,

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,320
would you like being teased
and bullied like that?

77
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,920
<i>Don't cry, okay?</i>

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
<i>Everyone's got strengths and flaws.</i>

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,680
<i>Don't give up. Keep your spirits up.</i>
<i>I'm rooting for you.</i>

80
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,320
<i>P.S. Eat the lollipop.</i>
<i>It'll make you smile.</i>

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Thanks.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,720
So, Mr. Din was the one
who wrote that letter.

83
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,800
Another presentation tomorrow.

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,520
These days never seem to end.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Right.

86
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,960
Here. This is to make up
for the other day.

87
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
What are you plotting now?

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm serious. I bought it to apologize.

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,400
Keep it and eat it then.
Take it as me accepting your apology.

90
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,280
If you don't take it,
that means you're still mad at me.

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,360
I told you I'm not mad. Now move.

92
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
Oh!

93
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,000
You shouldn't have done that.

94
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,760
Yeah, Rach. You went too far this time.

95
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Yo even came over to apologize to you.

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
If it were me, I'd be scared too,
with that act.

97
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,440
-Cherry!
-Cherry!

98
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Sorry I snapped at you.

99
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,400
I thought
you were gonna mess with me again.

100
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,040
So, in your eyes, I'm just all bad,

101
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,520
nothing good about me, huh?

102
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,080
My dad's been sick lately.
I've just been stressed.

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
Sorry about that.

104
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,760
Uncle Suthee's unwell? Is it serious?

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
Yeah, pretty serious.

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm sorry for everything I've done before.

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,160
I don't even know
why I treated you so badly.

108
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,160
But from now on,
I promise I won't do it again.

109
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,280
Okay?

110
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Pinky swear? Isn't that a bit childish?

111
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,120
If you won't, that means
you haven't forgiven me.

112
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,760
Or do you want it official?

113
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,080
I'll print a peace treaty and sign it.

114
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
That's a bit much.

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,440
<i>Your father's muscular heart disease</i>

116
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,960
is caused by blocked coronary arteries.

117
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,240
It's been getting worse, and right now,
it's reached a critical stage.

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
How much time do we have left, Doctor?

119
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,320
I can't say exactly,
but we need to act fast.

120
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,360
As soon as there's a donor heart,
we operate immediately.

121
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,520
Mr. Din?

122
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
You forgot to update me
on Uncle Suthee's condition.

123
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,000
A heart transplant

124
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
is going to cost a lot.

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,880
-I'll mortgage the house and land--
-It won't be fast enough. You know that.

126
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
But I can help you.

127
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,680
It's just that… I have one condition.

128
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,520
You'll have to marry me.

129
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
-Uncle Perm.
-Yes, sir?

130
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
Is Ms. Sarah in today?

131
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, I thought you knew. She's on leave.

132
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,120
I see.

133
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,000
There's no telling

134
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,120
when a donor heart will appear

135
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,920
or if it will be a match.

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,040
And once it's removed,

137
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,120
it's only viable for four hours.

138
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,280
Yes, Doctor.

139
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,880
What we can do is keep
the patient ready at all times.

140
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,360
For now, all we can do is pray

141
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,920
that a heart arrives in time

142
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
and hope your father can hold on.

143
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,320
Please take care of him, Doctor.

144
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
We will.

145
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Once you finish this, send it right in.

146
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,000
And be extra careful
with the heart documents.

147
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,280
The factory says the gift set Ms. Sarah
designed and submitted is almost done.

148
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,280
They'll let us know
when the prototype is ready.

149
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
Okay.

150
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,200
Once they confirm,
have them come present it.

151
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
Got it.

152
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,320
Come in.

153
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,360
Mr. Din, I'll get going now.

154
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,120
I accept your offer.

155
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,760
But it's only a marriage in name.

156
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,600
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

157
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,320
Agreed.

158
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,600
I need to get the surgery money ready
as soon as possible.

159
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,680
Here you go, Mom.

160
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,480
Chicken feet.

161
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,440
-Eat up.
-Okay.

162
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,120
So you'll have strength.

163
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,920
Mom.

164
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
Sara and I…

165
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
We're getting married.

166
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
-Really, Din?
-Yes.

167
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
-What did you do?
-Nam!

168
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
-Nam.
-What did you do?

169
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,840
How did you get her to say yes in one day?

170
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,240
-What dirty trick did you play? Say it.
-Nam…

171
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,680
She and I love each other.

172
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
You couldn't win her.
Don't take it out on me.

173
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,880
-Nam! Yo, stop your brother!
-Nam.

174
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,280
-Nam, stop!
-Nam, stop!

175
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,080
She loves me. Never mind punching.

176
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,640
Even if you kill me,

177
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
she still won't choose you.

178
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,440
-Din…
-Nam!

179
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,560
-Nam!
-Nam, stop. Stop! Yo.

180
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,360
-Get him out of here. Go. Nam, stop.
-Let go!

181
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,560
Nam, stop.

182
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,280
Go now!

183
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,600
-Out here. Come on.
-Let go.

184
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,960
-Nam.
-Nam, come here.

185
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
-Calm down, son.
-Calm down, Nam.

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,680
Let go! Didn't you see what he did?

187
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
He stole the woman I love!

188
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm not letting him get away with it.

189
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,640
-Nam!
-Nam!

190
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,760
Get a grip!

191
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,040
They've agreed to get married.

192
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
What else can you do besides accept it?

193
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,480
No, Mom. A guy like Din
doesn't even know how to love.

194
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,640
He only loves his work and himself!

195
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,560
Nam.

196
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,680
-Listen to me. Listen.
-I…

197
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,200
will wait until
Ms. Sarah changes her mind.

198
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,079
Nam.

199
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,480
Wouldn't it be better to love someone
who actually loves you back?

200
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,160
That'd just be lying to myself, Mom.

201
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,960
Someone like me…

202
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,720
If I can't be with the one I love,

203
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
then I won't be with anyone at all.

204
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,680
-Nam.
-Nam.

205
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Are you happy you got a surgery slot?

206
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
Of course I'm happy.

207
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,200
But I'm worried about something else.

208
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,720
Tell me.
Who did you borrow the money from?

209
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,720
Right, you said mortgaging the house
and land would take too long.

210
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,040
So, where did you get the money from?

211
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,880
I…

212
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,040
I borrowed it from Mr. Din, Dad.

213
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,880
He'll deduct it from my salary,
and I'll pay him back

214
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
It's not much for him anyway.
He won't mind.

215
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,840
And since you were close with his father,

216
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,640
he's confident
we won't run off with the debt.

217
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,760
Excuse me.

218
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,240
Are you ready, Mr. Suthee?

219
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
Ready.

220
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
Good luck, Dad.

221
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,680
We'll be waiting to hug you after, okay?

222
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,800
We'll be here.

223
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,680
Hang in there, Dad.

224
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,920
Alright.

225
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
Where's Uncle?

226
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,600
He's already in surgery.

227
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,480
Sorry I'm late.

228
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,840
I called the office
and heard you took leave,

229
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,720
so I figured you'd be here
and rushed over.

230
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,880
Dad got an emergency surgery slot.

231
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,440
Thanks so much for coming.

232
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,760
Are you really going to marry Din?

233
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,240
I know you're not doing it willingly.

234
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Just tell me.

235
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,960
What dirty trick did he use
to make you agree?

236
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,560
There's no trick.

237
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,520
I'll tell you the truth.

238
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,280
I've secretly fallen
for the person who wrote that letter

239
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
since I was a kid.

240
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,320
And when I found out
that person was Mr. Din,

241
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,040
everything just made sense, because I know

242
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
he loves me too.

243
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,440
But I don't believe he does.
A guy like him can't love anyone.

244
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,040
He only cares about himself
and the company.

245
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Thanks for the warning.

246
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,160
If I get married and end up unhappy,

247
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
that's between me and him.

248
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,760
But thank you again

249
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
for caring.

250
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,880
Sorry, we're closed.

251
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,160
Nam.

252
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,920
What's wrong?

253
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,040
What happened? Why are you crying?

254
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm heartbroken.

255
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,880
I've never hurt this much in my life.

256
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,760
What happened?

257
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Did Ms. Sarah turn you down?

258
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,160
Not just turn me down,

259
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,120
she's marrying Din.

260
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,680
-Hello, Ms. Sarah.
-Hello.

261
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,280
Hello, Ms. Sarah.

262
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,800
Hello.

263
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,840
-Mr. Perm.
-Yes?

264
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,120
Why's everyone acting so weird

265
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,920
and greeting me like this?

266
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,760
Oh, everyone knows
you and Mr. Din are getting married.

267
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,480
I'm thrilled, really.

268
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
Hello.

269
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,160
Don't start lecturing me about knocking.
I've got bigger news.

270
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,560
Our wedding, you mean?

271
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,720
Huh?

272
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,240
Don't tell me you're the one
who told the whole company.

273
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,560
Uncle Perm knows, the world knows.
End of story.

274
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,960
Why didn't you stop him?

275
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,840
Why would I?

276
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Sooner or later,
everyone would find out anyway.

277
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,440
Why are you so mad about it?

278
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,160
Because it's not just that.
Do you know how far the rumors have gone?

279
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
Hey, they say Mr. Din's only marrying

280
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,040
to fix the company's bad luck,
since it's struggling.

281
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,040
Really?

282
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,680
I think so.

283
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,880
At first, I thought
she'd end up with Mr. Apo,

284
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,280
he promoted her that hard.

285
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
Won't the brothers
kill each other over this?

286
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,520
Exactly.

287
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,080
I've been leading him on for years,

288
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,640
and somehow I lose to the new girl?

289
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,240
She totally came here to bag Mr. Din.

290
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,720
That's what I think too.

291
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
Rush a wedding like this,
what else could it be?

292
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,360
She's probably pregnant.

293
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,080
Gossiping
like my title means nothing, huh?

294
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Yeah. But you're a guy. No harm done.

295
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
Me, though…

296
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,480
Guess I should wear a ButterBear mascot
suit just to walk into the building.

297
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,720
It's not that bad.

298
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,680
But don't worry.

299
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,600
I won't let your reputation take a hit.

300
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120
What so funny?

301
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,320
ENJOY YOUR WORK, ALRIGHT?

302
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,560
This is your plan to kill the rumors?

303
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,040
They're gossiping even more.

304
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,760
Except now they're saying

305
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,840
I'm crazy about you,
chasing you till you agreed to marry me.

306
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,680
No harm done to you. And I'm a man.

307
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,400
I can take it.

308
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll settle the bill.
You go see your dad first.

309
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,840
Okay.

310
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,680
You're still as kind as ever.

311
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,440
Oh my…

312
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Am I sick or something?
I can't stop smiling.

313
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,200
You first.

314
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
Thank you.

315
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,720
Once the gift set's ready,
can I let people outside test it?

316
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
It's not work hours yet.

317
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,280
No need to wait. I'm impatient.

318
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,800
Then today, we can go to…

319
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,760
Din.

320
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,400
Eyes?

321
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,920
Choked on it, Mr. Perm?

322
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
Thanks.

323
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,480
I didn't think Ms. Eyes
would come back to Mr. Din.

324
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,320
Come back?

325
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,520
No need to look so tense, Mr. Perm.

326
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,720
One look at Mr. Din's face and I knew
she's an ex.

327
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,040
But don't worry.

328
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,720
I'm not petty. I just want to know

329
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,400
and understand the situation, that's all.

330
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,440
Ms. Eyes dated Mr. Din back in college.

331
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,560
No idea why they broke up.

332
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Classic tight-lipped CEO.

333
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,280
Thanks.

334
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,400
Wow.

335
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,080
I haven't been here in ages.

336
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,040
But your office looks exactly the same.

337
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,680
The office is the same,
but everything else has changed.

338
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,760
When you first came here,

339
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,560
PD was still one
of the top five cosmetics companies.

340
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
But now…

341
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,000
I've heard the rumors too.

342
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,800
But I believe in you.
You'll get through this,

343
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,720
just like you always have.

344
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,720
Thanks.

345
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,960
So, what brings you here, Eyes?

346
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,000
Are you crazy?

347
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Why'd you bring
that woman back to see Din?

348
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,760
I didn't.

349
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,520
I just saw on Facebook
she was back in Thailand, so I said hi.

350
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,800
I just told her
to go check on him, that's all.

351
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
There's more.

352
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,480
She's divorced.

353
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,800
What?

354
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,000
Whoa, hey. Come on.

355
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,040
That'll stain, hard to wash out.

356
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,520
You set her up for Din, didn't you?

357
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,000
If Din doesn't like her,
what can I do, right?

358
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,200
Have you forgotten

359
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,120
how bad it was
when he got his heart broken?

360
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,240
I remember, but that's his business.

361
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,200
Eyes has always been nice to me.

362
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,560
Are you mad because you're worried
or because you're jealous?

363
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,280
If you can tease me like that,
you must be pretty confident

364
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,040
she can make Din dump Ms. Sarah.

365
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,840
Wow.

366
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,400
Din! You scared me.

367
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Congrats to our new project lead.

368
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,760
You knew?
They only announced it this evening.

369
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,960
Then how would it be a surprise?

370
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,080
Din.

371
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,520
-Do you like it?
-I love it.

372
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,320
Thanks, Din. I love you.

373
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,040
We promised we'd do our master's together.
Why did you do this?

374
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
Eyes…

375
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,600
My dad's sick,

376
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,000
and the company's in trouble.

377
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,080
I really can't leave, Eyes.

378
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,360
What about me? What about our life?

379
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
You're always like this.

380
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Family. Company.

381
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,080
Those are the only two things
that matter to you.

382
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,560
That's not true. I care about you a lot.

383
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
Well, good thing you won't go with me.

384
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,320
Let's take a break.

385
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Eyes. Eyes.

386
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,040
Don't go.

387
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I love you.

388
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,000
I think…

389
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,080
we should renegotiate our deal.

390
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,720
Deal?

391
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,320
Call off the wedding.

392
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
Let me pay for Dad's treatment
in installments.

393
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,640
That way, I won't have to force myself,

394
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,640
and you'll have a chance to get back
with Ms. Eyes.

395
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,040
Win-win for both of us.

396
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
No.

397
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,240
Nothing's changing.

398
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,960
Thanks for the ride.

399
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,160
Anyone could see from the moon
you still haven't gotten over her.

400
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,040
Why did you send Eyes to see me?

401
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,680
It's early, bro. I'm not arguing with you.

402
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,040
I'm not arguing, just asking.

403
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
Or is it that you can do it,
but can't admit it?

404
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,560
Honestly, whether Eyes
came or not doesn't matter.

405
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,040
What really matters

406
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
is how you feel.

407
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,280
Lost my appetite. I'm out.

408
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,880
Hello, Sara.

409
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,440
<i>Hi, Mr. Din.</i>

410
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,920
Are you ready
to go look at wedding dresses?

411
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,920
Wedding dresses?
When did you schedule that?

412
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,520
Alright then.

413
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,720
I want to see you in a wedding dress too.

414
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,160
Wait, I haven't said anything yet.

415
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,280
See you there.

416
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,000
You mocking me?

417
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,920
You brought Eyes to see me,
hoping I'd get distracted,

418
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
or better yet, fight with Sara.

419
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,280
So, I showed you it didn't work.

420
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,200
Sara and I will never fall apart
over your cheap tricks.

421
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,040
<i>I just came to warn you. Be careful.</i>

422
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,880
The person who asked you to work
with them isn't exactly clean.

423
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,600
But my offer still stands.
Call off the wedding.

424
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,200
<i>Are you a human or the Yellow River?</i>

425
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,680
<i>You really let your fiancé</i>
<i>go out with his ex?</i>

426
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,320
<i>Are you free today?</i>

427
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,840
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

428
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,520
<i>Can you come to my condo?</i>

429
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,480
Eyes! Eyes!

430
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,760
Eyes!

431
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,440
Eyes!

432
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,760
