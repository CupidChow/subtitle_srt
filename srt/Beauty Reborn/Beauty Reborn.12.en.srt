1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
<i>The next CEO of PD will be…</i>

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>Mr. Apo.</i>

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
<i>My mother's already dead.</i>

4
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>Your mother? Dead?</i>

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,160
She actually left you!

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
<i>I've found Ms. Krongthong's address. But…</i>

7
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,240
<i>You should prepare yourself a little.</i>

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,440
<i>Your mother didn't want you to be born.</i>

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,280
<i>She intended to have an abortion.</i>

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Your father begged her to keep you.</i>

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,479
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>he legally married Krongthong.</i>

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,080
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>they just couldn't make it work.</i>

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,880
So they divorced.

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
Dad…

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>You said your father lied</i>

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
so you'd end up serving
Ms. Namnuan and the boys.

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
That's not true at all.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,080
<i>Tesho knew exactly</i>
<i>what kind of person your mother was.</i>

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,120
<i>He didn't want you to get hurt.</i>

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
<i>And he didn't want you</i>
<i>tied to her anymore.</i>

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
<i>At the time, he thought</i>
<i>it was what was best for you.</i>

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Thanks, Dad, for telling me the truth.

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
<i>No problem.</i>

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,160
Getting it off my chest
made me feel a little better.

25
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
<i>That's all for now, Din.</i>

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes.

27
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,240
About earlier, when I asked to go out…

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
Can we postpone it?

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
That's fine.

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
We can go whenever.

32
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm not going anywhere anyway.

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,120
Thanks.

34
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Mr. Nam moved out of the room?

35
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Yes. He said he was moving to a hotel.

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, Ms. Baicha.

37
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,600
Could I take tomorrow off?

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Sure. But what
are you taking time off for?

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
For prenatal care.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,280
I didn't think
I'd get pregnant this easily.

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,440
So, what new products
are we launching next,

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
Mr. Apo?

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Our new line

44
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,480
is men's products.

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Men? That's our new market?

46
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,160
PD has never made products
in that category before.

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,040
But the market value

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
for men's cosmetics

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
is 15 billion baht.

50
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,040
Wait. Hold on.

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
I'd like to hear

52
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,920
the vision from a CEO, like Mr. Apo.

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,040
Uh…

54
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,880
On average, the Thai cosmetics market
grows around 14 to 15% a year.

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Even though we don't have exact figures
on how much men's cosmetics grow yearly,

56
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,160
it's clearly going up every year.

57
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
And there are still
only a few players in the market.

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,200
So what reason is there
not to jump in, Mr. Chakrit?

59
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,800
Because we're not experts.

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,000
Ms. Sara just said
we've never marketed this before.

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Being inexperienced and not doing it
are two different things.

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,520
We'd never done low-cost gift sets either,
yet they're the ones thriving right now.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
And everyone disagreed with that idea.

64
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,120
And tell me.

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,120
Which product is making
so much profit right now?

66
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,160
Why did you hang me out to dry like that?
I only agreed to be CEO

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,040
because I thought you'd back me up.
Did you see?

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
That Krit guy nearly carved me up
in the middle of the meeting.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
I just have a lot on my mind right now.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
Yo told me what happened.

72
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
I get it.

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,320
But if you can't keep work
separate from your personal life,

74
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,560
Krit will manage
to undermine me sooner or later.

75
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll be careful
not to let this happen again.

76
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,600
Luckily, I've been doing
some extra research lately.

77
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,640
But I probably won't be
this lucky every time.

78
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
Since Mr. Nam is so dedicated,

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
can we continue the discussion now?

80
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,960
I'm serious about men's products.
I'm not just trying to save face.

81
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
I know.

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Please send the details directly to me.

83
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,680
If Din's still losing it,
contact me directly.

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
Thank you.

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,880
Well…

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,920
Ms. Sarah.

87
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,520
Actually,

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,480
there's one more thing

89
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,560
I need to talk to you about.

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
So…

91
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,040
Excuse me.

92
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay.

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
‪18 EARLY SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY:
‪HOW TO NOTICE AND CONFIRM

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
"It takes at least two weeks

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,680
before you can test
if you're pregnant or not."

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,920
And if a period is late,
are there any reasons besides pregnancy?

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,360
"There are many reasons for a late period.

98
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
It doesn't always mean pregnancy.

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Another major reason is stress."

100
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely stress.
There's no other reason.

101
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,280
Hey, it's already noon.

102
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Are you so down, you won't even eat?

103
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,040
Are you worried?

104
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,360
Is now really the time?

105
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
Is there anything you want to talk about?

106
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
About what?

107
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
About you standing me up yesterday.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
You weren't home.

109
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,760
Where were you?

110
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,520
We're open half-day today.
Come back tomorrow.

111
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm not here to eat.

112
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,960
Your name is Krongthong, right?

113
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,720
I knew you'd come looking for me one day.

114
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Don't think I'm going
to appreciate being a mother.

115
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
Because I never intended to have you.

116
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I know.

117
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,040
Good, then.

118
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,920
And don't come here
thinking you owe me anything.

119
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
It's enough that you're well and happy.

120
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,120
Because I could never have given you
any of this anyway.

121
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,520
Hey!

122
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,600
You told me you'd pay today.
If I don't get the money by 2 p.m.,

123
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
you're not selling here!

124
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,560
Didn't I tell you
I'll close the shop early

125
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
to get you guys the money?!

126
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,400
What's this? If you're going to talk
like that, I'm not paying anything!

127
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Don't make excuses!
If you're going to pay, pay now! Now!

128
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,880
- Pay up! Stay out of this!
- Bring it on! Come on!

129
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Come on! I've got nothing to lose!

130
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,000
- Come on. Come at me!
- Hey!

131
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,320
Yeah, I'll be back for it.

132
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,760
- You wait right here!
- Fine!

133
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
- You'll see!
- You bitch!

134
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
You better hurry back!

135
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,880
Don't you dare think
I'm gonna give you any money!

136
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,080
Damn those guys.

137
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,680
<i>In the end, I paid off her debt.</i>

138
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,360
It was my first and last act as her son.

139
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you at peace with it?

140
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,960
You don't think
I was being stupid, do you?

141
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Nobody's smart all the time.

142
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,920
The only important thing

143
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
is whether you feel at peace with it.

144
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
But I think your dad
was right about everything.

145
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
If I were a dad,

146
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,040
I'd probably tell my kid
their mother had died

147
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,720
rather than let them grow up
and have to deal with this.

148
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,040
We can't choose
the family we're born into.

149
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,640
But we can choose

150
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,480
what kind of person to be.

151
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
And the person you've chosen to be

152
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
is not bad at all.

153
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
Just "not bad"?

154
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
You want me to shower you with praise?

155
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Why don't you try then?

156
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,480
You're strong,

157
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
smart,

158
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,400
and a good person.

159
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,040
I think

160
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,280
that's more than enough.

161
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
Please.

162
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Please.

163
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,720
I am going to take such good care of you.

164
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
And you have to take good care of me too.

165
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,200
Got it?

166
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
How?

167
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,960
Ah. Well…

168
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
Look.

169
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
Here.

170
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
See this?

171
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,240
If we're in love

172
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
and my hair falls like this…

173
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,160
…you need to tuck it

174
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,800
behind my ear for me.

175
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,840
Yeah.

176
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,720
And then… kiss my forehead,

177
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,280
be sweet,

178
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,800
make me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

179
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,960
You got that?

180
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,960
That's all? Super easy.

181
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah.

182
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
What's wrong?
Why are you acting so shifty?

183
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Well, it's about the thing
I needed advice on.

184
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,040
But I don't want anyone else to hear.
I'm afraid they'll start gossiping again.

185
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,760
Is it a scandal?

186
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Don't tease me. I'm actually
really stressed about this.

187
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,840
- Hello, Ms. Chakriya.
- Hello.

188
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,720
Since you're a woman, Ms. Sarah,

189
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,680
could you tell me something?

190
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,280
If a woman suddenly goes
completely silent for a long time,

191
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,320
what should I do?

192
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,320
The person who disappeared,
what's her relationship with you?

193
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
She's a friend.

194
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,880
We just had a fight,
and I don't know how to apologize.

195
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,400
She won't answer my calls,
and she reads my texts but doesn't reply.

196
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,160
In that case…

197
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
just apologize directly.

198
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Especially if you're the one in the wrong,

199
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,640
there's nothing better than going
to see her and talking it out.

200
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,800
What are you hesitating about?

201
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,800
Nothing. I just…

202
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,240
I don't know where to start.

203
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,480
How about some
Western-style flower diplomacy?

204
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,000
Give her flowers as an apology.

205
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,080
And follow that up
with our company's new product.

206
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,680
It'll be a promotion at the same time.

207
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,640
Ms. Sarah!

208
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,160
You're sneaking in a product placement
like it's a TV drama.

209
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,840
My deepest apologies, sir.

210
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,080
I didn't think Nam
would be this well-prepared.

211
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes.

212
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
Next time,

213
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
I definitely won't mess up, sir.

214
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,600
That verbose old man!
He talks way too much!

215
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,000
MEDICAL CLINIC

216
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
So, are you buying or not?

217
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,280
Are you sure this will work?

218
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
If you're not sure, don't buy it.

219
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,320
I have things to do. You go home first.

220
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,480
Okay.

221
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,840
Hey!

222
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,640
Hey, miss.

223
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,960
Miss.

224
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,400
Are you alright?

225
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,080
Baicha?

226
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,280
Din!

227
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Baicha.

228
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,520
Baicha, are you hurt?

229
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,480
Should I take you to the hospital?

230
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,400
No, I'm fine.

231
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,720
I was just startled.

232
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,040
Okay, well then…

233
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,720
I'll take you home.

234
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,000
What's this med, Baicha?

235
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,160
What's going on?

236
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
What is this medicine?

237
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
I asked you what this medicine is.

238
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,480
I…

239
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm pregnant, Din.

240
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,080
Why are you just getting back now?

241
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,680
You didn't answer your phone.
I waited up all night.

242
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm sorry. There was
another issue at the factory.

243
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,080
So I went back to sort it out,
and my phone battery died too.

244
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,960
I thought…

245
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,280
you had been in an accident.

246
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,680
Were you worried about me?

247
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm not talking anymore.

248
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,040
It's good that you're back.

249
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm going to get an hour of sleep
and then head to work.

250
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,960
I can give you the day off.

251
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm just as much
of a workaholic as you are.

252
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,000
Currently, the market value
for men's products in Thailand

253
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,480
is 35 billion baht.

254
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
Wait, wait, wait.

255
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,360
Didn't you say yesterday

256
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,320
it was only 15 billion? Where did
the other 20 billion come from?

257
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,720
Didn't you read the report I gave you?

258
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Men's cosmetics,

259
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,800
like deodorants, perfumes, and roll-ons,

260
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,800
are indeed valued at 15 billion baht.

261
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,880
But the interesting ones
are products related to skin, hair,

262
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,040
and beard care. That's where it is.

263
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,640
The 20 billion baht I wrote in the report.

264
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,680
So, what will the products
look like, Ms. Sarah?

265
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,960
We'll launch three items first.

266
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,000
Number one, an anti-wrinkle serum.

267
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Number two, shaving cream.

268
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,920
And number three, aftershave.

269
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,960
The market leaders
already own these categories.

270
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,360
If we clash with them,
we'll lose everything.

271
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
This group of people
isn't attached to brands.

272
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,880
They like to try new things.
They watch reviews on social media.

273
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,160
They compare quality and price.

274
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,440
And our product will enter as a new option

275
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,000
that is smart and offers great value

276
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,480
for people who are looking
to choose the best for themselves.

277
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
Right, Mr. Pathawee?

278
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
Mr. Pathawee?

279
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,560
Yes, right.

280
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,760
That's right. Does anyone disagree?

281
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,960
Only two people disagree.
I'll consider this project approved then.

282
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,200
In that case,

283
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,360
does anyone have any questions?

284
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,360
Not about the new product…

285
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,120
but about

286
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,480
Ms. Namnuan's position
as an executive director.

287
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,800
What? Why are you

288
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,200
suddenly bringing this up, Ms. Rosarin?

289
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,960
Ms. Namnuan's performance
has not been clearly defined lately.

290
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,720
And I believe that many
of the shareholders present here

291
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,520
share the same opinion.

292
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,080
I'd like to exercise my right
as a 20% shareholder

293
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,400
to nominate Nina

294
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,680
to take the position
of executive director instead.

295
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,720
Does anyone here object?

296
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,400
Ms. Rosarin, wait a minute. Ms. Rosarin.

297
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,280
Ms. Rosarin, hold on! Ms. Rosarin, wait!

298
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,000
Ms. Rosarin.

299
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
You broke your promise to me.

301
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,120
You said my salary and benefits would
stay the same if I sold you my shares.

302
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,600
But now you're forcing me
out of my position like this,

303
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,040
and that's going to affect
my pay and privileges too.

304
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Do you have a contract or any witnesses?

305
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,480
You can't stab me in the back like this.

306
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,840
Who's the one doing the backstabbing?

307
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,560
Isn't it you, Ms. Namnuan?

308
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,080
Your own family.

309
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
The child you raised.

310
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
You chose to betray him

311
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,880
for your own benefit.

312
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
How could I possibly trust you
with an executive director position?

313
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,920
Are we clear?

314
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,080
If you'll excuse me.

315
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,000
We

316
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,240
have a lot of things to do.

317
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,480
Watch out for the picture frame.

318
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Alright, once you're done,
you can go downstairs.

319
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
What?

320
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,960
You walked all the way here
just to gloat, right?

321
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,640
You must be really satisfied
seeing this happen to me.

322
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,320
If I said I wasn't satisfied,
I'd be lying.

323
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,680
But I'm only slightly satisfied.

324
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,520
Because I already knew
what was going to happen.

325
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,560
At least I got a good price for my shares.

326
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,360
I don't have to stress anymore,
unlike you guys,

327
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,120
who are still foolishly fighting,
even though you know you can't win.

328
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,240
That might be true.

329
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,880
But even if we lose,

330
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,720
at least we are fighting together.

331
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,840
Unlike you right now, Auntie.

332
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,880
You have no one left.

333
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,920
The reason I came to help

334
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,400
is because you haven't
succeeded at anything.

335
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Even the recent machinery deal,
you messed that up too.

336
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,960
But Nam won't agree.

337
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,000
What am I supposed to do? If I get
too harsh, will you turn on me too?

338
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
Your job is to get PD for us

339
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,640
in exchange for your revenge

340
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,400
without causing us to lose our interest.

341
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,400
So, just focus on how

342
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,600
to get Din out of the way.

343
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
But if you can't do that,

344
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,720
we won't need you anymore.

345
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,920
This coffee

346
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,640
is terrible.

347
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,800
When will the people here
finally remember how I like my coffee?

348
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,240
It's your job to remind the housekeeper.

349
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,920
If you can't even get this right,

350
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,120
you should just leave.

351
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,640
You understand, Chakrit?

352
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
Yes.

353
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,800
- Table eight.
- Copy that.

354
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,400
Aren't you having coffee?

355
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,000
I shouldn't drink
too much coffee right now.

356
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
Baicha.

357
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,360
I'm so sorry.

358
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
For everything.

359
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,120
I really didn't mean it.

360
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,520
It wasn't all your fault.

361
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,800
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

362
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,760
I'm truly sorry.

363
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,320
I love you so much.

364
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,560
You are the friend

365
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I love the most.

366
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,480
I really can't lose you.

367
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,280
Let's go back to how we were.

368
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,280
But we never changed.

369
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,720
And more importantly,
so what if you don't have me?

370
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,480
You still have Ms. Sarah.

371
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,840
What does that have to do with Ms. Sarah?

372
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,760
She just suggested
I apologize to you directly.

373
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,320
Really? Or did you just use me
as an excuse to talk to her?

374
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,239
Why are you snapping at me?

375
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm not. Don't pick a fight with me.

376
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,440
I don't know why you're mad
that I talked to Ms. Sarah about this.

377
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,440
Maybe it's about what happened that night.

378
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,760
I'm sorry. I was drunk.

379
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,840
You said sorry. Now go back.

380
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,760
No way. I really need to be sure
that you're not angry at me anymore.

381
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,560
Please forgive me.

382
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,639
Forget it. You can go now.

383
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Are you just going to hang out here
instead of working, Mr. CEO?

384
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm leaving now.

385
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,840
Don't you dare get involved
with those Phimarndech people, even him.

386
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
You know how much Mr. Praphop
is pressuring me right now.

387
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,560
I might have to go after him.

388
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,520
What are you going to do?

389
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,280
Now that it's come to this,

390
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,240
if I can't beat the Phimarndech family,
I'd rather die.

391
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
But before I die,

392
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
I'm taking them all down to hell with me.

393
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,800
Whether it's Nam, Din,

394
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
or anyone else.

395
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
TO BAICHA:

396
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,320
TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE HOME
DON'T OVERTHINK IT

397
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
I'LL HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT

398
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
Baicha.

399
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
Who's the father?

400
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,720
I really don't know

401
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,560
if he even wants the baby.

402
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,280
That's why I was thinking
about getting an abortion.

403
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,440
I don't know what to do, Din.

404
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
Please don't do that.

405
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm begging you.

406
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,040
Why are you begging me?

407
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,400
Because I'm thinking about myself.

408
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,080
I was so hurt

409
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,560
when I found out
my own mother tried to do that.

410
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,560
I don't want your child
to feel the way I did.

411
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,440
So, what should I do, Din?

412
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,560
What am I supposed to do?

413
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,560
Hey.

414
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,520
Mr. Din?

415
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,280
Yes, what is it?

416
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,240
What about you?

417
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,160
I've called you many times.
It's like you didn't even see me.

418
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,520
I had to knock to get your attention.

419
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,200
Sorry. I'm just stressed about work.

420
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
I think we should go to bed.

421
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,240
Let's go.

422
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,680
<i>Can you come out and meet me?</i>

423
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,880
<i>This way, no one loses anything.</i>

424
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
You can't really blame me.

425
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,120
- What <i>are you doing?</i>
<i>- I'm just…</i>

426
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
finding a way to make you

427
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,600
give me your shares,

428
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,920
handsome.

429
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,320
<i>We're only pretending to be married.</i>
<i>If you want to see other people,</i>

430
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
<i>I won't hold it against you.</i>

431
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,720
Just do it properly, and don't
stab me in the back, that's all.

432
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
<i>Baicha is pregnant.</i>

433
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,680
<i>Who's the father?</i>

434
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,040
- <i>Don't tell me…</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

435
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
<i>Baicha is pregnant with my baby.</i>

436
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,160
