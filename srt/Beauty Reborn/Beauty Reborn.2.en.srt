1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,120
<i>Hello. I'm Sara.</i>

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,160
Please call me Sarah.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,680
Pathawee Phimarndech?

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,040
Is that you, Din?

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,080
<i>Someone's so cautious now.</i>

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,159
She probably thinks I brought her here
to do something inappropriate.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
<i>Does the company have financial problems?</i>

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
<i>It's your first day here.</i>

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,400
Don't you think
that's an inappropriate question?

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,880
Hey. Are you okay?

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm claustrophobic.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,480
Hey!

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,200
<i>I'm Apo Phimarndech,</i>
<i>but you can call me Nam.</i>

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,040
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,960
Cut it out.
Who'd ever date such an ugly girl?

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,080
<i>Let me give you a little warning.</i>

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>That woman just started today.</i>

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
<i>Don't get handsy with her.</i>

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
I wasn't. Just flirting.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,920
You've been a show-off
since you were a kid, huh, Din?

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
Dad, hands together like this.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,600
Yeah. Then stretch them out.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,240
Alright, count.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Ten, 11,

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,560
12, 13, 14,

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,960
15!

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,480
Dad, I'd like to move
to an apartment near the office.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,680
We already have a house.
Why waste money renting another place?

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Our house is too far.
I can't afford to pay for taxis every day.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,840
When I think about it,
that actually costs more than rent.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Sweetheart, if you're planning to move out

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,480
so you can work overtime
and earn more money

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,640
for my surgery,

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
you don't have to.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,480
Dad, the salary here's really good.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,639
Even without overtime,
I'll still have plenty left to help you.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,560
That good?
I still don't even know where you work.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,400
You wouldn't know it. It's just…

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,960
a small company that's growing fast,

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,720
so they offered me a high salary.

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,960
Anyway…

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,920
I've got to go to the uni.
I'll be late for my presentation.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm leaving.

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,560
And sis, make sure
Dad keeps up his exercises, okay?

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,680
Got it.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
- I'm leaving, Dad.
- Good luck, son.

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, next move.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,280
Hold on.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't explain like it your brother does.
My ears hurt.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
Dad.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Why does he hate
the Phimarndech family so much?

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,520
Did something happen
while I was studying abroad?

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
He doesn't hate the whole family.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
Just one person.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,960
<i>Yo, the youngest son of Tesho.</i>

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,160
Uncle Suthee,
can you unload the stuff from the car?

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,400
Sure thing.

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
You like bossing around, huh?

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
My dad's not your servant.
Don't act like he is.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,600
I can just call the housekeeper, then.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,480
Aunt Soi? Aunt Soi, are you around?

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

63
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Dad.

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
- I'll leave it to you.
- Yes.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,240
Hey, calm down.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Why'd you stop me, Dad?

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,880
If we don't show them
we're not their servants,

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,760
they'll just keep treating us like one.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
Come on.

70
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,920
Carrying boxes is no big deal.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,160
Even though Tesho is gone,

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,960
we still owe him a great debt.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
If he hadn't helped when I was struggling,

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,079
who would've taken care
of your mom and sister?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Money debts can be repaid,

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,520
but a debt of gratitude
lasts a lifetime, huh?

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
Here.

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>Those two don't just have problems</i>
<i>at the Phimarndech house.</i>

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,600
They've been fighting elsewhere too.

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
Where?

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,160
At university.

82
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,040
Small world, huh?
They ended up at the same school.

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,200
And I heard they're even
in the same group for a presentation.

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,360
Who knows if they'll start another fight.

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I already sent the content.
Why didn't you put it in the slides?

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,680
You sent it at six in the morning.
What do you expect us to do with that?

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,880
We couldn't reach you all night.
We had to write the content ourselves.

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
Things come up sometimes, you know.

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Guys, come on.
Let's just use this time to rehearse.

90
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,840
I said, put my content in the slides

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,720
or I'm not presenting.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,680
Fine, we'll change only your part, Yo.

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,960
Come on. We're a team, right? Change it.

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,680
No way.
We've done enough because of him already.

95
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,800
If he can't do it,
let the professor deduct his points.

96
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,160
So, that's it?

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,280
You're mad because I once asked your dad,

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,600
the gardener, to help out?

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
You're taking it out on me?

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
- Yo!
- Hey.

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
I've been holding back long enough!

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
Hey! Stop fighting,
or we'll all fail the group project.

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,360
Yo, come with me.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,160
Come here, Yo.

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,560
We need to talk.

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
Come on, Yo.

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,680
Come. Let's sort this out.

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,600
You have to go apologize to Sarach.

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,920
We're about to present.
Don't start drama now.

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,200
He's been annoying since we were kids.
Always pushing my buttons.

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,640
Everyone else knows
you're the one who's annoying.

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,880
Who the hell sends slides at six
after disappearing all night?

113
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,000
I had things to do.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,080
Playing games doesn't count
as "things to do".

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Don't think I don't know.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,280
If it were me,
I'd have done exactly what they did.

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080
You're not being very nice.

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Well, always taking his side.
You like him or something?

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,320
Nina, are you in your room?

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
Hello, ma'am.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
Did you need something?

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll wait for you downstairs.

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,840
I should get going.

124
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
See you.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,120
Don't let him come here again.
I don't like him.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Oh, Mom, come on.
I don't even have a boyfriend.

127
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,040
Let me live a little.

128
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,320
What about Nam, then?

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,320
Not interested anymore?

130
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,080
If he were committed to me,
I'd be ready to give everything up.

131
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Be careful,
or you'll lose Nam to someone else.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,440
Who?

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Eating alone? Don't you get lonely?

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,240
Not at all. The food's so good, it makes
me forget what loneliness feels like.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,480
But it'd taste even better
if you had it with me

136
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,200
because I've got…

137
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,520
this! My secret weapon.

138
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Chili fish sauce? Should I be impressed?

139
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,840
Hey, it's the specialty here!

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,360
No idea what they put in it,
but it's incredible.

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,360
It lives up to the hype.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Though it probably tastes even better
with someone special.

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you doing here, Nina?

144
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,400
I came to see Din,
running an errand for my parents.

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm so glad to see you. I've missed you.

146
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
By the way,

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,880
I've never seen
this beautiful lady before. New employee?

148
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Are you asking me?

149
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,040
Of course. You're the only beautiful one
in this whole cafeteria.

150
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,600
I just started here a few days ago.

151
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,080
Which department?

152
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,640
Cosmetic science.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,720
You must be really smart.
Someone like me could never do that.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm impressed.

155
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Here you go.

156
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
Thank you.

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,760
I'd like to apologize for Nina.

158
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,320
For what?

159
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
For barging in like that.

160
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,160
We're… old friends.

161
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,720
We've known each other so long,
we sometimes forget our manners.

162
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,560
I figured you might not be used to that,
so I wanted to say sorry.

163
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,480
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

164
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,040
Tomorrow's Saturday.

165
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Wanna go out somewhere?

166
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm helping my dad at our farmhouse.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
No time for fun.

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,920
A farmhouse?

169
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Sounds interesting. Mind if I tag along?

170
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,120
It's not fun, trust me. It's exhausting.

171
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
I might find it fun.

172
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Suit yourself.

173
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,400
About the interest payment extension,
my father's okay with it.

174
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,400
Thank you.
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,560
Okay. I'm going
to the movies with Nam tonight.

176
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,600
You've already met Nam?

177
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes, he was with a pretty new employee.

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,520
Din?

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,200
I was just thinking maybe
I should fire everyone in this company.

180
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,800
It'd keep our secrets safe.

181
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,760
Otherwise, any new hire

182
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,160
can never escape your eyes and ears.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,560
If you want to keep a secret,
you'd better talk to your mother first.

184
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,560
Because if she doesn't approve,
no one here would dare say a word.

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
By the way,

186
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,000
why is there never sugar
with the coffee here?

187
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,480
You know I like things sweet.

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,720
Don't you ever try to please me?

189
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
I'll take care of it, Nina.

190
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Next time,
there'll be sugar served with your coffee.

191
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you so much.

192
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
I just want everything to go smoothly,

193
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
including your company.

194
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,440
<i>Don't worry, Dad.</i>

195
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,480
I'll take care of the company.

196
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,640
And as for Nam and Yo,

197
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,040
I won't let either of them struggle.

198
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm sorry…

199
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,560
you had to carry this burden for me.

200
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sorry…

201
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,280
‪I…

202
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,240
No matter how heavy it gets,

203
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll never give up, Dad.

204
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
Who's up so early?

205
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,560
It's Mr. Nam.

206
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,960
Damn it!

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,520
Haven't seen you this mad in ages.

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,200
How'd Nam even leave the house this early?
He usually wakes up in the afternoon.

209
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,920
I don't think he's slept yet.

210
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,240
I saw him while I was out jogging.
He was eating breakfast, chugging coffee,

211
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,120
and downing an energy drink too.
He's probably buzzing like crazy by now.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,880
And why didn't you tell me then?

213
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,000
You didn't tell me to.

214
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,040
How was I supposed to know
you wanted me to keep an eye on him?

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm gonna grab breakfast.

216
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,480
These flowers are beautiful.

217
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
Hey!

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,120
Who said you could pick them?

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,280
It's just one flower.

220
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,680
Even one is not allowed. They're for sale.

221
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,600
So stingy. I'll buy them all then.

222
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
Showing off won't make me swoon, you know.

223
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,480
And it's not that impressive either.

224
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,800
Let's go. There's more to see.

225
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,040
You're cute even when you scold me.

226
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Can these flowers handle the sun?
It's boiling hot in Thailand.

227
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,200
Salvias love sunlight.

228
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,520
They need at least
six to eight hours a day,

229
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
with an ideal temperature
between 20 and 35 degrees.

230
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
Don't pick any more.

231
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
I know.

232
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,400
Come on. Let's keep going.

233
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,040
Oh, thank you.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,840
Are you tired?
You've been following me around all day.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Not at all.

236
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,400
It's nice being surrounded by nature
once in a while

237
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,400
with such a peaceful atmosphere.

238
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Feels like I've recharged.

239
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,800
My dad and I take care
of this garden with love.

240
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,360
We want everyone who visits
to feel the same peace we do,

241
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,960
including the people who buy our flowers.

242
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,720
A garden this beautiful

243
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,360
must've been really well cared for.

244
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
It says a lot about its owner.

245
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
Beautiful, just like you.

246
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
<i>Let's play dolls!</i>

247
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Dolls? Ugh, so annoying.

248
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,600
Who'd even want to play with you?

249
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,960
If I hadn't taken care of myself
and glowed up,

250
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,400
you'd never even look my way.

251
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,640
Wait, why are you mad?

252
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,920
I was complimenting you.

253
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
Taking care of yourself is a good thing.

254
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,200
Never mind. I'm hungry.

255
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's grab something to eat.

256
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,680
This fried mushroom chili dip is amazing!
I've never had anything like it.

257
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,440
Such a smooth talker.
You probably say that to everyone.

258
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,080
Only to you.

259
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
"You" as in which "you"?

260
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,360
Din?

261
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,600
Hey, Din.

262
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,880
I snuck out and you still found me?
How'd you even know?

263
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,480
Let's just say I know.

264
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,560
But you shouldn't be out here
flirting around like this.

265
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,680
Nina's starting to put pressure on us.

266
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,360
If Mom gets back from France and finds
out, she won't take it well either.

267
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,520
We've been through this so many times.

268
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,880
Why do I have to live my life
by everyone else's expectations?

269
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
This is my life.

270
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,000
I have the right to choose who I love.

271
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
And does she love you back?

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,640
You've barely met Sarah a few times.

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
That's not love.

274
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,480
That's between me and her. Stay out of it.

275
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,960
You've never had to carry
the weight of someone else's life.

276
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,560
You don't know what sacrifice means.

277
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Do you know--

278
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Hello?

279
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Oh, the beta test review file's
having issues?

280
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm outside right now,

281
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
but I've got my laptop with me.
I'll send it over right away.

282
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,840
Yes.

283
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
You need to stay away from my brother.

284
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,920
If you've got eyes, you can clearly see
I haven't been pestering him at all.

285
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,280
He's the one following me.

286
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,120
You could've stopped him. Learn to say no.

287
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,480
I heard the office gossip.

288
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,440
You're planning to marry
your brother off to Ms. Nina

289
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
to save your company.

290
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
But since your brother doesn't like her,

291
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,560
you're trying to pressure me instead,
aren't you?

292
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,560
You know all that.
Did you bug my phone or something?

293
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,560
I can read you from across the galaxy.

294
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,080
Impressive.

295
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,960
I know you're being sarcastic, but thanks.

296
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,600
If you know that much,
then stop messing with my brother.

297
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,480
I can't.

298
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
That's an order.

299
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,080
Even if you're my boss, you can't
boss me around about my personal life.

300
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,840
Hey.

301
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,880
Seriously, tell me.

302
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,200
Do you like him that much?
You really can't stop?

303
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,200
- No.
- Then why?

304
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Things like this take teamwork.

305
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,480
Say I tell Mr. Apo

306
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm not interested and to leave me alone,

307
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,560
what if he doesn't listen?
What am I supposed to do?

308
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,960
And even if he does,
it doesn't mean he'll fall for Ms. Nina,

309
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,400
right?

310
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,840
Hey.

311
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,320
Then tell me what I should do.

312
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,440
Spend less time playing matchmaker

313
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,760
and more time getting financial advice.

314
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,920
Wait.

315
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
Whoa, watch it!

316
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,840
Din.

317
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,560
You like Ms. Sarah?
Is that why you're acting like this?

318
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,240
Like what?

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,040
You keep taking her away from me.

320
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Taking her to the countryside,
sneaking off alone with her.

321
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm her boss. Taking an employee
to see work sites, what's wrong with that?

322
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,280
And you,

323
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,160
stop acting like the relationship police.

324
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,360
I don't care. This one I really like.

325
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,400
Since the first time I saw her.

326
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,720
Even if she hasn't shown any sign back,

327
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,560
mark my words.

328
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm not backing down.

329
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Not ever.

330
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,160
Even if it means
our family business goes under, Nam?

331
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,280
Mom.

332
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,480
Hello.

333
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,200
When did you get back?

334
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,360
We'll talk about that later. But for now…

335
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Din, we need to talk.

336
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,080
This is our hometown's
best tom yum noodles!

337
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,400
And today, I'm going to mix them
with ice cream.

338
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay, let's add it in.

339
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,680
Here we go. Can everyone see this?

340
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,920
"Not weird enough. Next time, go crazier."

341
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,120
You'll have to donate first.
If we hit 10,000,

342
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
I'll come up with a new dish for you guys.

343
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,480
Alright, let's try it.

344
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,560
It's actually really good!

345
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,840
Someone just showed up. Next time,
I'll take you to try something else.

346
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,800
Get your donations ready.

347
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll use them to buy a new in-game skin.
It's super cute!

348
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
See you next time.

349
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,160
You look happy.

350
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,840
My crypto chart just shot up,

351
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
so I can't stop smiling.

352
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,040
Baicha.

353
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
If you're going out
with those Phimarndech boys,

354
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
be careful.

355
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,920
You know they're Dad's enemies.

356
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,240
The fights of the older generation
should stay with the older generation.

357
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,080
Both their dad and ours have been gone
a long time. Why keep hating each other?

358
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,840
I'll never stop hating them

359
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,880
until we take back
the company they stole from us

360
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,080
or their family falls apart.

361
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,760
If I ask you
to stop hating them, would you?

362
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,240
You can go.

363
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,480
I had to come back from France

364
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,920
because Mr. Praphop
and Ms. Rosarin called.

365
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
They've put the investment

366
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,320
for the project we presented on hold

367
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,560
until Nina and Nam's marriage
shows progress.

368
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,240
How do we fix that?

369
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Fire that girl.

370
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,560
Name her severance figure and do it.

371
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,800
Mom, look at this.

372
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,320
This is production data for every
cosmetic manufacturer in Thailand.

373
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,480
She could've sold it to me,
but she gave it away for free.

374
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,200
Didn't even ask for money.

375
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Where else would you find someone
that generous and dedicated?

376
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,640
Listen to me.

377
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,040
Nothing in this world is free.

378
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,320
You think she's not getting
anything out of this?

379
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,720
Anyway.

380
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,000
If you won't fire that girl,

381
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,000
then make sure Nam breaks up with her
and marries Nina as soon as possible.

382
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,160
- Wait.
- Ah!

383
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,520
- Whoa, watch out!
- Ah!

384
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Ugh.

385
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,520
Stop it right now.
What are you even thinking?

386
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
You're back?

387
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,080
Have you eaten yet?

388
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,160
Hey, what's wrong?
Why aren't you answering me?

389
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
Why did you lie to me?

390
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,840
Lie about what?

391
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,400
About working at PD.

392
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,160
Hello?

393
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,200
<i>Hello. I'm calling from PD Company.</i>

394
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,720
There's something urgent I need to discuss
with Ms. Sara. Is she available?

395
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,560
PD?

396
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,880
No wonder he found me.

397
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't change the subject.

398
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
Say what you want to say.

399
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,480
I don't get you. We've had to live off
their so-called kindness for so long.

400
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,720
Why would you go work for them again?

401
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,280
How long are we gonna stay
indebted to that family?

402
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,080
I get how you feel.

403
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,400
But right now, we need the money.

404
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,520
And this job pays really well.

405
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,920
I didn't have a choice, Sarach.

406
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
Yeah, I know.

407
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,000
It's just frustrating. No matter what,
we can never get away from that family.

408
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Sarach.

409
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>Sure, I'll pick you up.</i>

410
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,360
Wait a sec. I'm heading out now.

411
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Wait a minute.

412
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,840
Sarach.

413
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,160
Yeah?

414
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Could you grab my car keys
from the living room? I'm going out.

415
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,200
Why can't you get them yourself?
You've got legs, don't you?

416
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,800
Ever heard of the word "kindness"?
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

417
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,000
You were already on the phone
when you walked out here.

418
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,240
- Just go back--
- I'll wait here.

419
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,560
Thanks.

420
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,120
Hello, babe? See you in 20 minutes.

421
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,360
Dress up for me, yeah?

422
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,480
<i>How long do we have</i>
<i>to keep living like this?</i>

423
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,880
Not hanging out with your friends today?

424
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Nah, too lazy.

425
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Yo.

426
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,280
Mom!

427
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Oh, I missed you so much. Give me a hug.

428
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,120
How was France?

429
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
It was lovely, dear.

430
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,080
Did you get me anything?

431
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,200
Oh, I thought you missed me.

432
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Turns out you only missed the souvenirs.

433
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,240
But yes, there's your favorite chocolate.
It's in the fridge.

434
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
Yay!

435
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
You're the best, Mom. Thank you.

436
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,680
Alright.

437
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
- Come on, Mom. Let's eat.
- Let's go.

438
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,200
This chocolate's so good.
Your favorite kind.

439
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,160
Thank you.

440
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,240
If I didn't have to rush back
because of Mr. Praphop and Ms. Rosarin,

441
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,280
I would've had time
to buy a lot more gifts.

442
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,640
Right, Nam?

443
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,280
You should take Nina out sometime,
for shopping or even dinner.

444
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,560
Don't forget that our family

445
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,240
still depends on her father's support.

446
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm already late. Gotta run.

447
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
Love you, Mom. Bye.

448
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,680
You see how unconcerned your brother is?

449
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,520
Yes.

450
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,880
So, make sure
you take care of this matter properly.

451
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

452
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,120
- That took forever.
- Yeah.

453
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,920
But it was worth it.

454
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,560
The place looks nice.

455
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,239
And being closer to the company
isn't a bad thing.

456
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,400
You don't have to wake up early anymore.

457
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,760
I hope so.

458
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,639
By the way, what's this I heard

459
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,760
about Mr. Apo chasing after you?

460
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,560
How come?

461
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
How did you know about that?

462
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,440
Please. Everyone knows.

463
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,840
Normally, he never shows up at the office.

464
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,880
But lately, he's been there every day.

465
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,160
People are gossiping nonstop.

466
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,200
And since our companies are connected,

467
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,720
word travels fast.

468
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,920
It's…

469
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,360
It's nothing.
He's just infatuated, that's all.

470
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,960
If I still looked like I did back then,

471
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,480
he'd treat me the same way
he did when we were kids.

472
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Then I guess
we should thank that accident.

473
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,960
It made you gorgeous,
like you were reborn.

474
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,520
Wow, that's harsh. "Like I was reborn"?

475
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,120
Yeah.

476
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat.

477
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,360
Good idea.

478
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,160
Hi, Ms. Sarah.

479
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,200
Oh, Mr. Apo.

480
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,360
I heard you moved into a new place, so…

481
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,880
I brought you this to say congrats.

482
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
Thank you.

483
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,040
It's a shame I'm busy today.
Otherwise, I'd have helped you unpack.

484
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,840
Oh, I wouldn't want to bother you.

485
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,320
I don't have that much stuff anyway.

486
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,240
Besides,
I already have someone helping me.

487
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Well…

488
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,280
Toy, this is Mr. Apo, my boss.

489
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm Toy, her ex-boyfriend.

490
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,640
Our relationship is…

491
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,520
kind of complicated. Hard to explain.

492
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,400
Nice to meet you.

493
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,880
- Well, I'm starving.
- Yeah, yeah.

494
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,160
Why don't we go grab something to eat

495
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,400
and talk there?

496
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,520
Sure. What do you feel like?

497
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,160
Italian? Japanese?
I know tons of good places.

498
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,600
Sara's never been into bland, cheesy food.

499
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
How about fermented crab?

500
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,200
Sounds good. I want something spicy.

501
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,000
Maybe som tam with noodles?

502
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
You okay with that, Mr. Apo?

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,640
This place is our favorite spot.

504
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,840
The fermented crab papaya salad here

505
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,560
is fire.

506
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,520
Well… I'm fine with anything.

507
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,280
Okay, what should I order for you?
I'll write it down.

508
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,000
Regular papaya salad.
Not too spicy, please.

509
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
Not too spicy?

510
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,040
Fancy people's taste buds

511
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,600
can't really handle something.…

512
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
spicy, huh?

513
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,720
That's fine.

514
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,520
We'll just order his mild

515
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,880
and ours with ten chilies.

516
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
- Perfect.
- Alright then.

517
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,040
You can order whatever you like, Ms. Sara.

518
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,480
I'll have ten chilies too.

519
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
Or mash the chilies first,
then add the papaya.

520
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,040
You sure about that?

521
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,280
Positive.

522
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,640
Eat it all! You won't find flavor
like this anywhere else.

523
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,760
This place is one of a kind.

524
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,000
You okay? Too spicy?

525
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,000
No, no.
I just swallowed wrong, that's all.

526
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
Alright then.

527
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,280
‪-Wow.
‪-Fabulous!

528
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,000
It's so good!

529
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,640
I swear, the auntie who makes this
must've sold her soul to the devil

530
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,320
for flavor that perfect,
right to this sissy's core!

531
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Super-spicy…

532
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,240
Right, bro?

533
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,680
So…

534
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,320
Mr. Toy is…

535
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,480
Well…

536
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,480
LGBTQ.

537
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,320
Oh my.

538
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,160
Blame the auntie's magic hands!

539
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,680
They made me reveal my true self!

540
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Never mind that. Come on, eat.

541
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,800
Let's eat.

542
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
No matter how many years go by,
her cooking is still incredible.

543
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,080
Thank you so much
for taking me and Toy out for the meal,

544
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,120
even though you barely touched your food.

545
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,240
That's alright.
I wasn't that hungry anyway.

546
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,440
Seeing you and Mr. Toy enjoy it that much,
that's enough for me.

547
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
About Toy,

548
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
don't mind him teasing you, okay?

549
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,960
At first, I was going to mind.

550
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,520
But when I found out
he's actually your close friend,

551
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,200
not your ex,

552
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,440
I felt a lot better.

553
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
Right.

554
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
I'll be honest with you.

555
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,840
I like you, Ms. Sarah.

556
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,360
<i>I'm worried because</i>

557
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,400
<i>I like you, Sarach.</i>

558
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,760
You never told me
why you wanted me to come along today.

559
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,880
<i>I heard their new R&D hire is really good.</i>

560
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,800
So, I wanted to meet her myself.

561
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,440
<i>You really think I'm that stupid?</i>

562
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,240
<i>Just admit it. You like her!</i>

563
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Yeah. I like Ms. Sarah.

564
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,880
