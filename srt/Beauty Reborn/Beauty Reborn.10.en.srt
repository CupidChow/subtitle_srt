1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,800
<i>Even if you didn't love me</i>
<i>like your real child,</i>

2
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,440
I never thought

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,240
you'd do this to me.

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,720
<i>People have to put themselves first.</i>
<i>That's just how it is.</i>

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,960
<i>I want to ask you to vote for Mr. Din.</i>

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,120
-<i>And what will I get?</i>
-I'll divorce Mr. Din,

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,120
just like you asked.

8
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,320
I will never divorce her.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>Even if I lose everything,</i>
<i>I'll still have Sara.</i>

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,360
I've lost, Nam.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,400
I've lost…

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
So, what now with Din?

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
Wayo abstains.

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,120
I vote for Mr. Pathawee.

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
I vote for Mr. Chakrit.

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
You're back.

17
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
My brother's in trouble, isn't he?

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,080
You know what's going on?

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,160
On a day like this,
how could I possibly miss it?

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm not sure

21
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,520
what you hate your brother for.

22
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,200
But what I'm sure of

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,760
is that your brother
did everything for the company.

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
He did everything for the company.

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,880
So much that he didn't care
how anyone else felt.

26
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
So, if he loses his position today,

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,360
it's only fair, isn't it?

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,400
I don't even want to imagine

29
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
that you could be this selfish.

30
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,640
Even if I weren't,

31
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
you'd never choose me anyway.

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,320
That's not true.

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,160
Ever since we were young,

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
I've always believed

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,360
that deep down,

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,880
you're gentle and kind.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,480
But maybe you're scared

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
to show people who you really are.

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
And I've been waiting

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,960
for the day

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,079
when your true self
would overcome that fear

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,040
and become a better version of you.

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Stop being such a coward

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
and hiding under Ms. Namnuan's shadow.

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Unless you want to be selfish
for the rest of your life.

46
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,760
The votes are in.

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,760
Excluding Mr. Wayo, who abstained,

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
and Mr. Apo, who didn't attend,

49
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,280
I've won.

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
Thirty percent to 26.

51
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Pathawee.

52
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Thank you.

53
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,920
Even if you're only
saying it out of courtesy.

54
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
So,

55
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,440
do you want to say a few words, Din?

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
Since you've held this role for so long,

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,560
I'll give you a chance to say farewell.

58
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Go ahead.

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,840
Sorry I'm a little late.

60
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm still a shareholder, aren't I?

61
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
Nam.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Where on earth have you been?

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
We'll talk about that later.

64
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,080
Right now, what I need to know is,

65
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
I still have the right to vote, correct?

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,720
Yes.

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
You own shares in this company.

68
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,320
So, of course, you're entitled to vote.

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,000
We couldn't reach you.

70
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,120
Mr. Pathawee must be…

71
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,160
quite surprised.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,800
Well… quite a bit.

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,320
But nothing's going to change now.

74
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,960
Then I'd like to cast my vote for…

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Mr. Pathawee.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
What nonsense is this?

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Your son flipped the whole thing around.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,360
We were leading, suddenly Din wins.

79
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,360
And you…

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,120
You abstained on Wayo's behalf.

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,160
Otherwise, we could've
still balanced the votes.

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
It's ruined. Completely ruined.

83
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,400
Ruined because of you and your sons.

84
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,440
I was sure we'd win,
so I didn't want to force Yo.

86
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,160
I didn't think Nam would do this.

87
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,480
Then what was Nam thinking?

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Didn't he fall out with Din?

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,360
I don't know.

90
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,200
He definitely ran off because of Din.

91
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
But I don't get why this happened.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
"Don't get it"?

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Is that all you can say?!

94
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,040
<i>Stop being such a coward</i>

95
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
<i>and hiding under Ms. Namnuan's shadow.</i>

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,560
<i>Unless you want to be selfish</i>
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,800
<i>Mr. Nam, I'm sorry</i>

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
<i>for speaking to you so harshly.</i>

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,160
<i>And thank you so much for helping Mr. Din.</i>

100
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,200
What's that message?

101
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,880
Why do you look so sad reading it?

102
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
She thanked you as his wife, didn't she?

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,280
Can I…

104
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
crash here at your cafe tonight?

105
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,760
I don't want to go home.

106
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,600
Don't wanna see anyone.

107
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,720
Of course. Then…

108
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
sleep in the back room.

109
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,880
I'll get it ready.

110
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
But don't worry.

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
I'll work for the bed.

112
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Good.

113
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Really, Din?

114
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,000
You actually won the vote?

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,040
Yes! There you go, bro!

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
See you later.

117
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
Hey, Din won the vote!

118
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,800
He's not getting kicked out.

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,880
Nam came back in time to help him.

120
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
-I'm so glad!
-Really?

121
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah!

122
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Congrats.

123
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Let's go get ice cream. My treat.

124
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
-Let's go.
-Okay.

125
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Three chocolate bars, okay?

126
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
I'd even go for ten.

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,720
My brother didn't get fired today.

128
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Let's celebrate!

129
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,280
You're not jealous of me.

130
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
You're jealous of Sarach.

131
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
You snake.

132
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm here to return your money, Uncle.

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,560
Not all of it yet,
but there isn't much left.

134
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,400
I'll find the rest as quickly as I can.

135
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
Because the gift set
is selling very well right now.

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,280
Investors from other companies
are interested in scaling it up.

137
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,200
So, I wanted to pay you back first.

138
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Glad to hear that.

139
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I'll excuse myself.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Well then, I'll take my leave.

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
Wait, Din.

142
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Hold on.

143
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
I didn't mean to hurt you or Nam.

144
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
I understand.

145
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,360
Your father lent my family money.

146
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,600
Of course, he expects returns.

147
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
That's reasonable.

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,960
I'm just worried about the vote.

149
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm afraid Nam will think poorly of me.

150
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
If that's the case,

151
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,920
it's up to Nam.

152
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll be going now.

153
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
Hello.

154
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,560
I knew you'd be here.

155
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,400
This is lightly roasted Panama Geisha,

156
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,160
a delicious cup I just tried.

157
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry
for speaking to you badly earlier.

158
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,920
It was my fault.

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,360
When I got angry,

160
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,920
I only viewed you negatively.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
So, you came here because you felt guilty?

162
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
Yes.

163
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
And to say thank you

164
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,480
for… helping vote for Mr. Din.

165
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,160
I think
you see me in too positive a light.

166
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
I only did it because it benefits me.

167
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,000
So you knew
Mr. Din would be more beneficial to you.

168
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,360
Are you being overly biased toward him?

169
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,960
I married your brother
for benefits too, you know.

170
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
No one knows it better than I do.

171
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,680
So, there's no need
to keep pretending anymore, right?

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,640
No, there isn't.

173
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,120
So, you'll leave Din then?

174
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,320
At least then I might still have a chance.

175
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Your brother made a terrible coffee?
Why are you choking like that?

176
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
It's not that.

177
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,960
I was just surprised you spoke so plainly.

178
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,520
Things have changed now.

179
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Mr. Praphop intends
to take over the company.

180
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,040
Your stepmother
sold all her shares to survive.

181
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,080
But Mr. Nam

182
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,760
was like a knight in shining armor
coming to your rescue.

183
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,840
So, we don't have to hide secrets from
someone who stood by us in our hardship.

184
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,120
But… You shouldn't say that.

185
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,320
Why not?

186
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,200
What if he decides
to try to hit on you again?

187
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
Then everything we've done
would be for nothing.

188
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,840
You think Mr. Nam won't change his mind?

189
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
Who knows.

190
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,960
Or do you want him to go again?

191
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,680
We're not tied
to each other anymore, are we?

192
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,720
Hey, sorry. I didn't mean it.

193
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm sorry, Sara.

194
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,080
Hey, Sara. Wait. Hey.

195
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,680
It's already late in the afternoon.

196
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,760
Might as well get some sugar
in your system, huh?

197
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
Water's no match for bubble tea.
Believe me.

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,360
Have a sip, please.

199
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
Where is he?

201
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,520
<i>Sorry I spoke without thinking.</i>

202
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
<i>I didn't mean to insult you.</i>

203
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,960
<i>I'm just happy being with you like this.</i>

204
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,920
<i>And I want to stay like this</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

205
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,960
<i>So, I got scared</i>
<i>I wouldn't have a moment like this again.</i>

206
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>That's why I said something awful.</i>

207
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm not forgiving you that easily.

208
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,120
How mean.

209
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,920
Well…

210
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
Shall we go home now?

211
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,760
You're late, and you're saying that now?

212
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,760
If I'm not going home…

213
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,240
Where else would I be?

214
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,680
Please.

215
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,440
Careful.

216
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
Why are you taking my booze?

217
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,120
This is a cafe, not a bar.

218
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
If you want to drink, go outside.

219
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,040
You'll get wasted and wreck my place.

220
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
You said you care about me.

221
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,040
So?

222
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,120
How's that broken heart of yours?

223
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
Ms. Sarah came by today.

224
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,800
She admitted it.

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,560
She married for money
to pay her dad's medical bills.

226
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,680
And what did you say to her?

227
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,920
If she said that,
it means you still have hope, right?

228
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,560
So, you'll leave Din?
At least then I might still have a chance.

229
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,680
I'm not going to divorce Din.

231
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Why not?

232
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
Or are you…

233
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,440
worried about your reputation?
I don't care about that.

234
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,480
Even if I did divorce him,

235
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,600
we couldn't be together.

236
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,440
I like you as a friend,

237
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,640
not as someone
I want to spend my life with.

238
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,840
If you know your own feelings,

239
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,240
you'll understand how I feel, right?

240
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
Do you really love Din?

241
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,160
What did she say?

242
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
Did she say she loves Din?

243
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
She didn't answer.

244
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,880
But even if she did, she wouldn't pick me.

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,880
It'd be like you and Din,

246
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,040
just brother and sister.

247
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
Nothing more than that.

248
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,040
You get it now?

249
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,880
If you do, give me back my drink.

250
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
Go get a new glass.

251
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,800
CHERRY

252
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,480
<i>Posted the clip already, Cherry.</i>

253
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,080
‎THANK YOU, SARACH

254
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,680
<i>Ha.</i>

255
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
<i>You're even more dramatic</i>
<i>than the original clip.</i>

256
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,080
<i>Hello. Today I'm sharing my experience</i>
<i>of having an allergic reaction to a cream</i>

257
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,280
<i>from a company</i>
<i>that starts with the letter P.</i>

258
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,920
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

259
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,160
<i>you can buy this cream</i>
<i>pretty much anywhere.</i>

260
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,760
<i>Whoever said it's good, I'll say</i>

261
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,320
<i>it's definitely not.</i>
<i>My face broke out in a rash.</i>

262
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,920
-<i>I had to see a doctor, everyone.</i>
-This is bad news, Sara.

263
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
Hey.

264
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
Well…

265
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
You…

266
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,600
can sleep on the bed.

267
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,280
Hey, hey. Listen.

268
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Don't get any gross ideas.

269
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
I just felt sorry

270
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,240
seeing you sleep on the floor for days.

271
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320
If you try anything nasty,

272
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,720
I'll zap you with my taser.

273
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,480
Hey, I haven't even
thought about anything.

274
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,440
I was just surprised
you allowed me on the bed, that's all.

275
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
And too bad,

276
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
your taser was left in the car.

277
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,760
Hey. You…

278
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
What are you doing?

279
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,360
Back off.

280
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,840
At first, I didn't think of it,

281
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,920
but now I'm starting to.

282
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Hey! No, don't! Don't do that to me!

283
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,000
Your scared face is kind of hilarious.

284
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Eek! Ah, don't!

285
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Wait, you're gonna…

286
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,600
-Ouch.
-Was that funny, huh?

287
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,720
-What's so funny, huh?
-Don't.

288
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
-What's so funny?
-Hey.

289
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,120
Hey, pick up the phone first.

290
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
Quick, the phone's ringing.

291
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,000
Don't!

292
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,480
Hello, Sarach?

293
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,200
What?

294
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,200
<i>When I posted that clip</i>
<i>after trying that famous cream,</i>

295
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,320
<i>I thought I was the only one</i>
<i>who had a reaction.</i>

296
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>But my inbox blew up.</i>

297
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,320
<i>We had to go to the hospital as a group.</i>

298
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,840
<i>And look at this.</i>

299
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,040
<i>I, Ying Noi, sacrificed myself</i>

300
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,160
<i>and showed my face.</i>
<i>Look, it's totally wrecked.</i>

301
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,920
<i>And we've got medical certificates too…</i>

302
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Thousands and thousands
of comments, reposts, likes.

303
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,160
We're totally screwed.

304
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,560
But I already checked.

305
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,360
Our cream doesn't cause a reaction.

306
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,840
Even you, with your sensitive skin,
can use it just fine.

307
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,400
Someone is sabotaging us.

308
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
I've already explained it
to the authorities.

309
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Even if we have to halt production,

310
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,280
we won't owe fines to other companies.

311
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,880
Because once we restart production,

312
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
we can make the products in time.

313
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,360
How is that even possible?

314
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Don't try to fool everyone.

315
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,640
Every time you open your mouth,
it's just "bankrupt."

316
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,680
But you don't even own any shares anymore.

317
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,920
Even if he's lying,

318
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,560
-you have no right to ask.
-You…

319
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,120
I've lined up an emergency factory.

320
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
We just need to send them
the formula and samples.

321
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
If this problem is resolved,

322
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,520
we can still produce in time.

323
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
But for now, we have to wait
for the regulators to run their checks

324
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,920
and approve us to continue.

325
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,480
If we do that,

326
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,560
will we even make a profit?

327
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,120
It's better than taking a huge loss
from massive fines.

328
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,000
So, what about the company's recovery?

329
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,920
Who's taking responsibility
for shareholders who won't get dividends?

330
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,880
I will.

331
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
THIRTY THOUSAND BAHT

332
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,040
Here's a check for consumer compensation.

333
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
This low? How is that
supposed to cover damages?

334
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,120
Have you guys even calculated
medical costs?

335
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
Okay, then we'll cover the medical bills.

336
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
And we'll take you to the doctor.

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,880
My face reacted, not my leg.

338
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,840
I can walk to get treatment myself.

339
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,760
I'd rather fight for the consumers.

340
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,480
No way I'll let this go quietly.

341
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Come on. Let's go.

342
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,120
I don't want to be around phonies.

343
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,080
Stop acting sincere.

344
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,440
Excuse me.

345
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,840
Are you Ying Noi from TikTok?

346
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,560
I'm a fan of yours.

347
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,520
PD Company's been ripping off customers.

348
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm rooting for you.

349
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,720
You're amazing standing up for… Oh.

350
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,640
Fighting for others.

351
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,240
Can I get a photo with you, please?

352
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Mhm.

353
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,520
Don't forget to take your mask off.

354
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,880
I want to see your pretty face.

355
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
Just a little.

356
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,440
Sure.

357
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,360
Exactly like Sarach said.

358
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,520
Their faces are fine. It's all made up.

359
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,720
Check this out.

360
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,480
We got info on that woman. This Ying Yoi--

361
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,120
-Ying Noi!
-Yeah, whatever.

362
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
This Ying Noi Yoi Toi

363
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,200
has been arrested before
for blackmail and scamming stores.

364
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,840
I feel bad for Sara and Din, really.

365
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,600
When things go viral,
people try to ruin it.

366
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,520
The bad luck just keeps piling up.

367
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,120
True.

368
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,720
Now it's just down
to those two over there.

369
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,000
Let's see what they find out.

370
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Keep pushing the attack.
Make it worse than before.

371
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,920
<i>When money talks, anything's possible.</i>

372
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,320
Welcome food for the star.

373
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Thank you, sir.

374
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,520
You didn't disappoint me in choosing you.

375
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,440
You gave me the chance.
I'll give it my all.

376
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,040
Come on. Sit down.

377
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
All right.

378
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,440
Wait. Hold on, sir.

379
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,280
Let go! What is this, sir?

380
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,640
Hiring people to spread rumors.

381
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,360
Sabotaging the gift set
without my permission.

382
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
Do you know how much profit
we lost because of that?

383
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Next time you do anything
without clearing it with me first,

384
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
you'll pay big time.

385
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,040
And one more thing to remember by heart.

386
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,160
If this blows up publicly,

387
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,040
don't expect me
to come running to save you.

388
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,600
But I never showed my face, sir.

389
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,840
I had my people handle all of it.

390
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't worry, sir. There's no way
this will trace back to us.

391
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Absolutely not, sir.

392
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,320
No, no, please! Don't, sir. Please don't!

393
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,000
If this happens again,
you'll get hit hard.

394
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,480
Chakrit.

395
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll warn you as someone who knows you.

396
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,360
Play with fire and you'll get burned.

397
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,840
You're worried about me?

398
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040
Or are you scared
I'll go after Nam instead?

399
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
You don't know my father like I do.

400
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
My father only loves three things.

401
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,320
Me, my mother, and whatever brings profit.

402
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
If you can't bring profit,

403
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,360
prepare yourself.

404
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
You got it?

405
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah.

406
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,320
Crystal-clear 4K footage.

407
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,880
Add fraud charges
and we can wipe them out.

408
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,320
Too bad we don't know
who actually paid them.

409
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,560
Not hard to guess.

410
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,880
People like that
never let evidence point back to them.

411
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,280
For now,
just get Sara and Din out of the picture.

412
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,760
These creams ruined our lives.

413
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,720
The gift set was hyped like crazy.

414
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,440
But when something goes wrong,

415
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,440
the company
doesn't bother to look after us.

416
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,800
And on top of that,
they want to buy our silence.

417
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,800
How are we supposed to live
with our faces ruined like this?

418
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,960
Exactly.

419
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,200
<i>Lying, stirring the pot.</i>

420
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,880
<i>None of what you said is true.</i>

421
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,400
<i>Their real faces are flawless.</i>

422
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,080
<i>Those rashes were just makeup.</i>

423
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,240
Where did that mouthy kid come from?

424
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,720
You say we lied. Got proof, or what?

425
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,160
<i>Come and see for yourself.</i>

426
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,840
Today I want to talk about
the two women who made a fuss,

427
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,440
saying they were allergic
to company P's cream.

428
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,000
Turns out they were hired to do it.

429
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,400
They were paid to discredit a competitor.

430
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,000
UNITY IS STRENGTH

431
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
Posted.

432
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,040
Two women crying, "allergic to a cream."

433
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,360
But wow, those two divas

434
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,000
actually have fraud cases in their past.

435
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,200
PD would cover their medical bills,

436
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,320
but they didn't even want to go.

437
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,040
There's something fishy about them.

438
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
STORM

439
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,320
You keyboard trolls!
Stop hiding behind fake accounts

440
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,080
and attacking people.

441
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,400
If you claim we're lying,
prepare for a court summons.

442
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,880
<i>Then see you in court, ma'am.</i>

443
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,520
Who's that? Go check it out.

444
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,920
I'll deal with these trolls first.

445
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,720
What?

446
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,720
-What?
-We're screwed. The police are here.

447
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,640
What?!

448
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,160
Where do we hide? Oh no.

449
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,680
Go!

450
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,760
Run. Go away!

451
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,640
I told you this would happen,

452
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
and you messed up.

453
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,920
-Krit!
-Don't.

454
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
It's fine.

455
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll take responsibility, sir.

456
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,040
But I never showed my face.

457
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,200
And the people I hired,

458
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,640
-I already told them to disappear.
-As they should.

459
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,159
If they were dumb enough
to let this blow back to us,

460
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,760
you wouldn't be standing here
for me to slap you.

461
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,120
At least,

462
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,760
I can pressure Din to step down as CEO.

463
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,960
So, it's not all bad for us.

464
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,880
That's why you get another chance.

465
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,040
Work properly.

466
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,840
Don't screw me over again.

467
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,639
Yes, sir.

468
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,960
-Krit.
-I'm fine.

469
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,760
You shouldn't have tangled with them.

470
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,840
Don't worry about me.

471
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,120
I won't die from this kind of pain.

472
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,240
I can take worse. I'm not scared.

473
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,400
If it helps me beat
those Phimarndech people, so be it.

474
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,600
<i>Hi, kids.</i>

475
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
-Hi!
-Hello!

476
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,080
<i>The reason I called is,</i>

477
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,280
<i>I want to thank you for your help.</i>

478
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,240
<i>If it weren't for you guys,</i>

479
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,240
<i>we'd be in deep trouble for a long time.</i>

480
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,120
No problem at all.
We're family, of course, we'll help.

481
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,800
I just want to be useful for Din too.

482
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Make up for never helping him before.

483
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,600
<i>Oh.</i>

484
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,840
<i>Mr. Din said he'll find time</i>
<i>to take you all out to eat sometime.</i>

485
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
<i>Get ready.</i>

486
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,240
-Yeah! Celebrate!
-Free food!

487
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,200
Then I want a Thai barbecue,
buffet style. I'm going all out.

488
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,880
That day, I'll skip eating
for like six hours first.

489
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,280
Are you going to eat or have surgery?

490
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,040
You're asking for trouble, huh?

491
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,360
<i>I'll stop bothering you.</i>

492
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,120
<i>See you later.</i>

493
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,240
-See you!
-See you.

494
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,480
Thank you!

495
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
Free food! Free food!

496
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,720
-Thanks for helping my brother.
-Yo!

497
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,280
You betrayer!

498
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
What are you talking about, Cherry?

499
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,160
Why would Yo betray anyone?

500
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,480
Right, we all helped fix things
for those two siblings.

501
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
He's just using his brother as cover.

502
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,080
Yo, you can fool whoever you want,

503
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,760
but you can't fool me.

504
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,400
You and Sarach are obvious as hell.

505
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,120
You don't even care about
my feelings as your friend.

506
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,080
Come with me, Cherry.

507
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
See? I told you.
They've gotta like each other.

508
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
The more you know,
the more you swoon, right?

509
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Ow, that hurts.

510
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
Why'd you pinch me? That hurts!

511
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,120
Stop talking.

512
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,360
Wayo really has a crush on Sarach.

513
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,720
Love isn't defined by gender these days.

514
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,320
If it feels right, it's right.
Don't overthink it.

515
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,400
Still won't shut up?

516
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,360
Look at your friend's face.

517
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,320
Come here.

518
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,360
Let go. I said let go!

519
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,680
When did I ever betray you?

520
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
We just fistbumped
and hugged to celebrate.

521
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
Ruj and Namnueng were there.

522
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,120
Bullshit.

523
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,520
Your eyes practically
swallowed Sarach whole.

524
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,520
You think I didn't see that?

525
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,520
That's funny. Are you overthinking?

526
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,120
Then swear
you don't have a crush on Sarach.

527
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,320
If you feel more than friendship
for Sarach,

528
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,600
may Sarach hate you forever.

529
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,560
Hmph.

530
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,080
I knew you wouldn't dare swear.
You like Sarach.

531
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,640
Why would I?

532
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
What are you saying?

533
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,640
We're close

534
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,000
just because
our siblings married each other.

535
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,040
That's all.

536
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,560
Then swear it.

537
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
I swear I don't have a crush on Sarach.

538
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,440
If I do,

539
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,840
may he hate me for life.

540
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,840
Hear that?

541
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
<i>We're not friends. You're the rich kid.</i>

542
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,920
<i>I'm the gardener's kid.</i>
<i>We've always been on different levels.</i>

543
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
<i>Because of the drama</i>
<i>over the cream scandal,</i>

544
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
I'll take responsibility for this
by resigning.

545
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,520
<i>The next CEO of PD will be…</i>

546
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,120
<i>Mr. Chakrit.</i>

547
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,760
<i>I've had to swallow a lot</i>

548
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,560
<i>from your dad's womanizing</i>

549
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
<i>and putting up</i>
<i>with your mom squeezing money.</i>

550
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,280
<i>My mom's already dead.</i>

551
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,720
<i>Your mom? Dead?</i>

552
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,200
She actually just left you!

553
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,520
