1
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
<i>Did she say she loves Din?</i>

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
She didn't answer. But even
if she did, she wouldn't pick me.

3
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,400
I already checked. Our cream
doesn't cause reactions.

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,880
Someone is sabotaging us.

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,680
<i>I want to thank you for your help.</i>

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,120
<i>If it weren't for you guys,</i>
<i>we'd be in deep trouble for a long time.</i>

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
<i>I can pressure Din</i>

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,800
<i>to step down as CEO.</i>

9
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,760
<i>Work properly.</i>

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
Don't screw me over again.

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
- My sister too.
- Yo!

12
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,440
You traitor!

13
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
You think I didn't see that? Your eyes
practically swallowed Sarach whole.

14
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
Are you overthinking?

15
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,320
Then swear you don't have
a crush on Sarach.

16
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,960
If you feel anything more
than friendship for Sarach,

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,800
may he hate you forever.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,280
I knew you wouldn't dare swear.
You like Sarach.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,560
Why would I? What are you saying?

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,520
We're close
just because our siblings are married.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,240
That's all.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
Then swear.

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,680
I swear I don't have a crush on Sarach.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,040
If I do, may he hate me for life.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
Hear that?

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
I hear it.

27
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Hello, Mr. Praphop.

28
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Please follow me.

29
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
If things go on like this,
we're definitely losing our jobs.

30
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,800
Seeing how Ms. Namnuan is acting,
it's obvious who the new CEO will be.

31
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
First of all,

33
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,400
regarding the drama
over the cream scandal,

34
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,440
I've already dealt with the matter

35
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,880
concerning those hired attacks

36
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,560
that used false information
to discredit the company.

37
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,480
But the production stoppage

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,000
nearly caused the company to lose money

39
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
and resulted in no dividends
for another year.

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,640
So, I'll take responsibility for this

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,400
by resigning.

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Look, I admire the work
Mr. Pathawee has done up until now,

43
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,080
but at this moment,

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
PD needs a change,

45
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,440
so we can move forward.

46
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,280
In my view,

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
the person best suited

48
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,120
to lead us through this crisis

49
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
as the new CEO…

50
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
is Mr. Chakrit.

51
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
It's a great honor, sir.

52
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,440
I promise I will work tirelessly

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,880
for the company and for everything
that Mr. Pathawee has built.

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
Thank you for your commitment.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,920
But I believe there is still
another CEO candidate

56
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,440
who is the right person

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,920
to protect everything I've built.

58
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Who else could possibly do that?

59
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,200
It's me.

60
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
Nam?

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,120
I'd like to propose

62
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,160
a suitable candidate for PD Company.

63
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
And I'd like to use all my shares

64
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,760
to support Mr. Apo as the next CEO.

65
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,120
I believe

66
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,320
the majority of shareholders
will agree with this.

67
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
Nam.

68
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Why did you do this
without speaking to me first?

69
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
So, why did you come see me?

70
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
I want you to take over as CEO for me.

71
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,280
Right now, no one
is more suitable than you.

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
You know I don't like
getting involved in company affairs,

73
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,240
especially the politics there.

74
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,120
I helped you plenty last time.

75
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
That should be enough, right?

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
This isn't just about helping me
or the company.

77
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
It's for your own good too.

78
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
You might not care

79
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,040
if the company gets sold,

80
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,960
but having it taken away
right in front of you,

81
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
that's different.

82
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,120
You can just give up
and do nothing if you want.

83
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
But are you sure

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,080
you won't regret it later?

85
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
Since Mr. Pathawee

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,160
has made this proposal,

87
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
that's fine by me.

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Competition is always good
for the company, after all.

89
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,000
But still, I'd like to request some time

90
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,200
for all the shareholders

91
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,560
to carefully consider their options.

92
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,320
Therefore,

93
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,600
I move to recess the meeting briefly.

94
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,600
Always causing trouble.
This completely messed up the plan.

95
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,840
You need to do something.

96
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
Those two combined definitely
hold more shares than we do.

97
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,360
If the shareholders side with Din,

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
we're going to be at a disadvantage.

99
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,400
If we want to win, we need Yo's shares.

100
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,960
But I didn't have him sign
a power of attorney. So how can we vote?

101
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,120
Then Wayo has to come here himself.

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
Here. Right now.

103
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Yo, get to the company right now.
I need your help with something important.

104
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,080
He's probably in class right now.

105
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
He won't be able to come, Mom.

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
Thanks, Din.

107
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,400
You being this nice to me
gives me chills, you know.

108
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
Mom is going to call you today.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Give me your phone.

110
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,680
I'll handle whatever comes up.

111
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,960
As for you,

112
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,480
take this phone for now,
in case you need to call anyone.

113
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,560
I knew you'd try something like this.

114
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,360
There's no way you'd ever take my side.

115
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,280
If you know that, then give up already.
Why keep being so stubborn?

116
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,200
You're just wasting your time and energy.

117
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Things were going great.

118
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,520
But you threw in the towel

119
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,880
and sold your shares, just like that.

120
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Why?

121
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,200
Are you so afraid of losing your comfort
that you'll betray your own family?

122
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Din!

123
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Listen to yourself. You've been
around your wife too much.

124
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,680
At least when I fall,

125
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,280
Sara is the one who stays by my side.

126
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
I'm actually using Din's phone right now.

127
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll tell him when I see him.

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
Gotta go.

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,000
Sarach.

130
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,080
I didn't mean what I said back then.

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,160
It has nothing to do with me anyway.
Don't worry about it.

132
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,680
"Don't worry"?

133
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,040
You tell someone not to worry
and then try to walk away?

134
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,360
- Aren't we friends?
- We are not friends.

135
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,840
We just go to the same school.

136
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
We've known each other since we were kids.

137
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,240
You're the rich kid,

138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,520
and I'm the gardener's kid.

139
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,880
We've always been on different levels.

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Based on the vote,

141
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,560
the next CEO of PD will be…

142
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,440
Mr. Apo.

143
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Congratulations.

144
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
Thank you.

145
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,200
Where have you been, and what
did you do to get this worked up?

146
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
It's PD Company.

147
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,120
That damn Din pulled a move
and had Nam voted as CEO instead of me.

148
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,280
Nam? CEO?

149
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
I bet you never imagined

150
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
someone like Nam would have
the brains to be CEO too, did you?

151
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,520
When is that Din ever going to drop dead?

152
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
He's so irritating.

153
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,040
You lost. Just let it go.

154
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,080
How many years have you
lived like this? Just end it.

155
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,160
No. It's not over.

156
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
I'll never lose
to those Phimarndech people,

157
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,360
no matter what it takes.

158
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,480
So, you let Mr. Praphop
beat you up just for that?

159
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,600
Even if he killed me, I'd still do it.

160
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,280
As long as those Phimarndech people

161
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
are completely destroyed.

162
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,560
TO BAICHA: WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S STREAM
ALREADY SET UP THE CAFE

163
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,360
CLOSED IT FOR YOU. WHERE ARE YOU?

164
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
WHY AREN'T YOU COMING TO THE CAFE?
ARE YOU NOT EVEN GONNA REPLY?

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,200
<i>Are you not even gonna reply?</i>

166
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,960
<i>Watch out for Krit.</i>

167
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,560
<i>He won't let your family off easily.</i>

168
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,200
NAM

169
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
POWER OFF

170
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,480
Hey.

171
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,960
Get up already. It's ten o'clock.

172
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,680
I haven't slept through the night
like this in years.

173
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,400
Let me sleep a bit more.

174
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
If you want to rest, go ahead.

175
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm going to get
something to eat. I'm starving.

176
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,560
Okay, I'm up.

177
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,200
You can go back to sleep
if you want. I can just order food.

178
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,760
- You're sulking?
- I'm not.

179
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm not an idiot.

180
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Should we go out?

181
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,880
Where?

182
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,520
Have you ever wondered

183
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,480
why "Tokyo Pancakes" in Thailand
aren't actually from Tokyo?

184
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,359
I'm more curious why you haven't
eaten yet, so we can go make merit.

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,960
Well.

186
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,520
Satisfied now?

187
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,079
You look cute
when your cheeks puff up like that.

188
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,280
You look cute

189
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,800
when your cheeks puff up too.

190
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
Hey, put your left hand up like this.

191
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,960
And hold it out like this.

192
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Let's go make merit.

193
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
So smooth, huh?

194
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,360
Go. Fly away.

195
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
What did you wish for?

196
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,680
To be rich, obviously.

197
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,480
Even though my company
isn't giving dividends,

198
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,480
the inheritance
my father left me is a lot.

199
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,360
I can take care of you comfortably.

200
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,640
No thanks. My philosophy
is that good money

201
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,160
should always come from your own pocket.

202
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,360
So stingy.

203
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,760
What about you?

204
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,120
What did you wish for?

205
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,600
Huh?

206
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,640
You won't tell me your wish?
That's cheating.

207
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,880
I'll take you again sometime.

208
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,360
- Sure.
- I just found out you like making merit.

209
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
After messing people around,
you two are all lovey-dovey, huh?

210
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,320
You made Mr. Praphop yell at me.

211
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,600
What's going to happen
to our debts now? Did you even think?

212
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,560
Din's always wrong in your eyes, Auntie.

213
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,120
You always blame him.

214
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,720
Has he ever done anything
worth praising in your eyes?

215
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,120
Nothing.

216
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,800
Everything he tries fails.

217
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,920
What am I supposed to be proud of?

218
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,720
The only failure he has ever faced

219
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,160
is losing his mother

220
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,920
and having to grow up
with a stepmother who never valued him.

221
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,320
- That's enough.
- How can that be enough?

222
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,920
I've had to watch him
get treated like this so many times.

223
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,440
Nothing he does is ever good enough.

224
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,360
You use him like he's a servant.

225
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,080
But with your own sons,

226
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,880
have you ever ordered
them around like that?

227
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,760
You just let him handle everything.

228
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,320
Of course. He's not your biological son.
Why would you care?

229
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
You brat!

230
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,200
Let's go. Come on.

231
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
No matter how awful she is,
she's still my mother.

232
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,360
We still have to live under the same roof.

233
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Are you just going to tolerate someone
who disrespects you like that?

234
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Why respect people who leech off others?

235
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,360
When they're in trouble,
they run to us for help.

236
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
Your father behaved like a beggar.

237
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
That's a bit much, Mom.

238
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,560
At least Uncle Suthee didn't betray Dad

239
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,400
like you did by selling your shares.

240
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
And now I've already quit as CEO for you.
What more do you want?

241
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,400
Then why did you drag my son into this?!

242
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
I want you out of our lives.

243
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Stop having any sibling relationship
with my sons.

244
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
I've had to swallow a lot
from your father's womanizing.

245
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,040
I had to raise you,
the child of another woman.

246
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Put up with your mother squeezing money.

247
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,840
What do you think
I've gone through all these years?!

248
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,160
My mother's already dead.
How could she be squeezing you for money?!

249
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,240
Your mother? Dead?

250
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
She actually left you!

251
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,280
She slept with your father to have you,
then dumped you for money.

252
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,080
And she hasn't stopped
extorting us even now.

253
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,480
You only work this hard
to pay me and your brothers back.

254
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,960
Do you realize how lucky you are?!

255
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
Din.

256
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
Mr. Din, please stop.

257
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,240
Please stop.
Don't let yourself get hurt like this.

258
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,760
When I was a kid…

259
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,280
I tried to get good grades.

260
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,240
When I started working,

261
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,040
I did my very best.

262
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,440
Because I hoped my father and mother…

263
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
No.

264
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
Actually, just my mother.

265
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Because I already knew my father loved me.

266
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,720
But…

267
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,840
It's okay.

268
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
I know.

269
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
I know Mom never loved me.

270
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,840
No matter what I did,

271
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,240
Mom only ever loved Nam and Yo.

272
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,000
I accepted that a long time ago

273
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
because I knew

274
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,080
I still had Dad.

275
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,880
When Dad entrusted the company
to me before he died,

276
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,280
I did everything,

277
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,120
no matter how much I hated it.

278
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,520
But I was wrong.

279
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,280
It might not be what you think.

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,720
What else could it be?

281
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,880
Dad lied to me all this time.

282
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,040
He said my real mother
was dead, when, in fact,

283
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,360
she's still alive.

284
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,200
How am I supposed to see it any other way?

285
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,040
There may be only one truth,

286
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,960
but there can be many contexts to it.

287
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,040
I think…

288
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,080
I know someone who understands
this better than we do.

289
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,160
We should hear him out first.

290
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,080
Who is it?

291
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,360
Ms. Namnuan wasn't lying.

292
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,040
She just exaggerated a bit, that's all.

293
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Is it true my mother abandoned me…

294
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,680
for money?

295
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,680
I wouldn't call it "abandoning."

296
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,760
I'd say

297
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,240
she let you live with someone

298
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,560
who was ready to raise you.
That's more accurate.

299
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
As for whether it was for money,

300
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,400
Tesho and Krongthong were legally married.

301
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,520
When they divorced,

302
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,000
Krongthong was entitled to marital assets

303
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,640
and alimony.

304
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,800
And I think that's perfectly normal.

305
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,120
If it was normal,

306
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,720
then why lie and say
Din's mother was dead?

307
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,240
Dad.

308
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Please just tell me the whole story.

309
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,080
It means so much to me.

310
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,880
They didn't love each other.

311
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,600
Krongthong was a model who worked with PD.

312
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,920
When Tesho was young,
he was quite the womanizer.

313
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,520
Once she got pregnant, they had to marry.

314
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,320
<i>But they didn't love each other.</i>

315
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
<i>Tesho tried his best to make it work,</i>

316
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,080
<i>but they couldn't stay together.</i>

317
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
WEDDING INVITATION

318
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
<i>So they divorced.</i>

319
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,720
DIVORCE CERTIFICATE

320
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Did they hate each other so much

321
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
that he had to lie and say she was dead?

322
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
That's personal.

323
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,480
I don't know the whole story.

324
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
About the lie,

325
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,640
Tesho probably had his reasons.

326
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Reasons to make me grateful,

327
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
to serve Ms. Namnuan and my brothers?

328
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,040
Mr. Din.

329
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,440
I really can't see it any other way.

330
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,080
Even setting aside the part
about her leaving me for money,

331
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,360
the fact that he lied

332
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,600
hurts even more,

333
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,760
because I loved him the most.

334
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,000
Dad.

335
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
Do you know where my mother is?

336
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,480
I'd really like to meet her just once.

337
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
I honestly don't know.

338
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Mr. Din?

339
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,560
Hello, Mr. Din. How can I help you?

340
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,240
<i>Uncle Perm.</i>

341
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,760
Do you know anyone named Krongthong?

342
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,560
Uncle Perm?

343
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Uh…

344
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
Which Krongthong exactly?

345
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
My mother, Uncle.

346
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,320
<i>That silence means you knew.</i>

347
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Din.

348
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,200
No need to apologize.
You were following Dad's orders.

349
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
<i>Uncle Perm.</i>

350
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,600
I want to meet my mother just once.

351
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,880
Do you know where she is?

352
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,640
I don't know exactly,
but I can probably track her down.

353
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,720
In that case, I'll leave it
to you. Thank you.

354
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,800
So, why did you tell Din?

355
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,120
Just to spite him.

356
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,080
He likes standing in my way so much,
and then he has the nerve to lecture me?

357
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,480
He deserved it.

358
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,600
Wasn't that a little cruel, Mom?

359
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
You already secretly
sold shares once before.

360
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
Zip it.

361
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,000
You and he ganged up on me
and made my side lose, and I got blamed.

362
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,760
I didn't say a word about that.

363
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,200
But this is different, Mom.

364
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,400
I am your mother.
If I say it's the same, it is.

365
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,320
Right.

366
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,040
Hello, Uncle Perm.

367
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,600
<i>I've found Ms. Krongthong's address.</i>

368
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>I'll send you the location.</i>

369
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
Really, Uncle? That was fast.

370
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,320
I've run errands for Mr. Tesho

371
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,600
about Ms. Krongthong many times.

372
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,520
<i>So, I had contacts I could reach out to.</i>

373
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,520
But… Mr. Din.

374
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,520
What is it?

375
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
<i>You should prepare yourself a little.</i>

376
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,200
Why?

377
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,640
You'll see when you meet her.

378
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,880
Thank you, Uncle.

379
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,800
Is something wrong?

380
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,640
If you're not ready,

381
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,200
we can come back another day.

382
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,840
It's okay.

383
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,200
I want to meet her.

384
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,840
Alright.

385
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,120
Wait.

386
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,560
I said no garnish.
Did you even listen, Auntie?

387
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Oh, I forgot.

388
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
Just eat it! Stop being difficult.

389
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,560
Hey, are my noodles ready?
I need to eat today!

390
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Why are you rushing me?

391
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,480
Hang on! I'm working by myself here!

392
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,800
- Hey, Auntie!
- What?

393
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,840
Should I collect today's interest
along with yesterday's?

394
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
I don't have it. Just go home.

395
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
Hey. You said the same thing yesterday.
You think this is a joke?

396
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Look, all I've got
is noodle broth. You want it?!

397
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,560
Just go home for now.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

398
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,880
If I can't sell anything,
none of you get anything!

399
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Remember,

400
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,280
if I don't get my money tomorrow,
I'll trash your shop!

401
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
Go! Get out of here!

402
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey!

403
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,720
- Let's go.
- You guys want some noodle broth?

404
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
Let's go.

405
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,240
What the hell is wrong with these people?

406
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,920
Are you going in?

407
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,639
PLEASE DON'T BE SAD…

408
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,040
<i>Please don't be sad.</i>

409
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,480
<i>Everyone has problems in life.</i>

410
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,920
<i>Just look beside you,</i>

411
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,240
<i>and you'll always see</i>
<i>people who stand by you.</i>

412
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,840
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

413
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,800
<i>P.S.</i>

414
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,840
<i>If you're stressed,</i>
<i>add a little sweetness to your life.</i>

415
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,320
Aren't you ever going to change the trick?

416
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,560
It works. Why change it?

417
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm not a kid anymore, you know.

418
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,000
How did you know
a lollipop would cheer me up?

419
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,360
Then give it back.

420
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,840
No way.

421
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
- Give it here.
- No.

422
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,040
Give it back right now. Come here!

423
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you.

424
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,080
I really meant what I wrote, you know.

425
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,680
I don't want you to forget

426
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,400
- that beside you, you always have--
- You?

427
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,360
It's not just me, though.

428
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,560
You still have Mr. Nam, Mr. Wayo,

429
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,240
Uncle Permboon,

430
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,760
and so many others.

431
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
But the most important person…

432
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
is you.

433
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,360
Are you blushing?

434
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,200
No.

435
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,040
I don't get shy over this.

436
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,280
Okay, I believe you.

437
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,520
Then I'll kiss your hand again,
since you're not shy.

438
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,000
Hey! That's enough.

439
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,520
Let's go on a trip tomorrow.

440
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,320
What's this?
Suddenly inviting me on a trip?

441
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,560
Don't you want to go?

442
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,160
DAD SUTHEE

443
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Your dad.

444
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,480
Yes, Dad?

445
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,240
At first, I wasn't sure if I should call
and tell you this, Din.

446
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,800
But I didn't want you
to misunderstand your father

447
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,840
any further.

448
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,600
What do you mean?

449
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,960
Tesho didn't mean to lie to you.

450
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,520
He just didn't want you to be sad,

451
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,320
so he told you your mother was gone.

452
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,240
Because…

453
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,440
your mother didn't want you to be born.

454
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,800
She intended to have an abortion.

455
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,920
Wh--

456
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,440
Why did my mother want to abort me?

457
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,520
Krongthong was a famous
rising model back then.

458
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,160
She thought that if she had
to carry a baby for nine months,

459
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,840
<i>she wouldn't have gotten another chance</i>
<i>to be that famous again.</i>

460
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,560
Krong!

461
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,920
Are you crazy?

462
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,640
That's your child.

463
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,240
Don't you feel any love at all?

464
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,120
I didn't want it to be born!

465
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Who knew it would happen
after doing it just once?

466
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,400
There's no way
I'd let you get an abortion.

467
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,560
Even if you don't want it,

468
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
it's my child.

469
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
So, how are you going to compensate me?!

470
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,960
My career is booming!

471
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,480
You expect me to ruin my future
for a kid I never wanted?!

472
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,880
Krong!

473
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,280
<i>Your father begged her to keep you.</i>

474
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,680
He could have hidden it
and arranged an abortion

475
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,240
<i>without worrying about any other expenses,</i>

476
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,040
but he didn't let her.

477
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>he legally married Krongthong</i>

478
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,120
<i>just to reassure her.</i>

479
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,440
<i>Like I said,</i>

480
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>they just couldn't make it work.</i>

481
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,520
<i>Your mother went through money like crazy.</i>

482
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,280
What were you spending
hundreds of thousands a month on?!

483
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Are you trying to bankrupt me?

484
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,120
You own a cosmetics factory!

485
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,760
What's the big deal?!

486
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,200
No matter how rich I get, it won't
be enough if you keep spending like this.

487
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,240
How about this?
I'll give you 50,000 a month,

488
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,880
and that's it. Deal?

489
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,960
Are you crazy?! You tricked me

490
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,680
into carrying your baby,
and now you treat me like this?

491
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,400
You promised me everything!

492
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm only spending this much…

493
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,040
<i>No matter how rich Tesho was,</i>
<i>he wasn't printing his own money.</i>

494
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,520
And PD wasn't this big back then.

495
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
So, they eventually had to get divorced.

496
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,240
<i>Why are you brushing me off like this?</i>

497
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,960
<i>I only agreed to be CEO</i>

498
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,720
<i>because I thought you'd back me up.</i>

499
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Did you see? Krit nearly carved me up
in the middle of the meeting.

500
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,720
<i>I'm sorry. I've just have a lot</i>
<i>on my mind right now.</i>

501
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,520
There's one more thing
I need to talk to you about.

502
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,320
What is it?

503
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>So what if you don't have me?</i>
<i>You still have Ms. Sarah.</i>

504
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,600
<i>I'm pregnant, Din.</i>

505
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,400
<i>What should I do?</i>

506
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,040
