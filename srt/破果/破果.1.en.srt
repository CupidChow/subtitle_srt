1
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,533
Just eat it.

2
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,325
It's a hamburger.

3
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,492
Drink this too.

4
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,783
Do you have somewhere to go?

5
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,658
You know how to do dishes, right?

6
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:02,263
Honey.

7
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,491
I can't work for a while anyway.

8
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,366
I can't give you money.

9
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,158
Instead, I'll feed you and let you sleep here.

10
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:23,824
You're here.

11
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:29,658
Let's just listen.

12
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:33,200
Where did you go again?

13
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,533
You were gone for a whole week.

14
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,366
It's not just a day or two.

15
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,950
Why are you suddenly curious about that?

16
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,075
Extermination.

17
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:47,450
Huh?

18
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,616
I just caught some bugs.

19
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:15,866
Give it to me.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,783
So clumsy.

21
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,199
Honey.

22
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:28,033
Did you have a good trip?

23
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,033
Thank you. Quickly, sit down.

24
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,366
Who are you?

25
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,616
What are you doing?

26
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:55,908
Let go of me!

27
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:19,324
Help me!
Don't kick me out.

28
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,324
Please just let me stay here.

29
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,492
- I did something wron...
- It's okay.

30
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,033
I just killed a bug.

31
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,658
Fingernail.

32
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,908
Your name is Fingernail from now on.

33
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:01,768
Mister, what are you doing?

34
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,198
What are you staring at?

35
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,033
An adult is standing, why don't you quickly get up?

36
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,325
You rude jerk, where are you...

37
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,782
Why are you burying your head in your phone and ignoring me, huh?

38
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:12,532
Mister, I'm pregnant. This is a priority seat for pregnant women.

39
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,408
How much is inside your belly,

40
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,366
Or if it's just grease from eating fried chicken and jokbal.

41
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,532
How would I know?
Show me.

42
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:22,033
Ah, why are you doing this?
I told you I'm pregnant!

43
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,700
No, there's also a mister sitting in the pregnant women's seat over there,

44
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,848
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Just, hmph!

45
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,200
What are you staring at? Damn.

46
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,325
Girls these days,

47
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:32,326
Don't even get married, huh?
Don't even have kids.

48
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,216
And just try to suck money from men, huh?

49
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:37,908
They only talk about being pregnant when it's convenient for them, huh?

50
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,533
- What?
- Ah, please be quiet.

51
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:41,450
What!

52
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,200
'...It's on the right.'

53
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:47,616
'Those going to Gumin Hospital
Please exit at this station.'

54
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,450
- Oh, I...
- Ah, is this old woman crazy, damn.

55
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:53,950
So unlucky, damn.

56
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,616
Sticking so close, damn, tsk.

57
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:03,015
- I'm getting off.
- Just a moment, I'm getting off.

58
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,158
Oh, really.

59
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,283
- Ugh.
- Just a moment.

60
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,284
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,783
Excuse me, Mister.

62
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:18,367
It's not me, it's not me.

63
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,224
Excuse me, sir.

64
00:08:58,225 --> 00:08:59,134
Right?

65
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,117
Hey, my son, huh?

66
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,366
You said you'd do it for him.

67
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,907
- Client, you shouldn't do this.
- Please, just one more time?

68
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,240
- Just a moment, let me talk.
- You can't do this here.

69
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,742
No, this is Shinsung Extermination, right?!

70
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,307
- Oh, no, you've come to the wrong place.
- Let me talk for a moment.

71
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,491
Oh, Ms. Jo-gak.

72
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,991
Sansevieria is easy to grow, I told you.

73
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,700
It's great for beginners, really!

74
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,908
Ah, I really bought it because of godmother, why won't you take it?

75
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,950
No, it even blooms and you only water it twice a year.

76
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,491
Huh?

77
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,783
Oh, for goodness sake.

78
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,804
- Even if I say something good is good, like this...
- Oh my.

79
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,950
Only people who can grow plants should grow them.

80
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:38,158
I have a black thumb, so I'm worried it'll die, so please take it today.

81
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,032
Cho-yeop-ah.

82
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:42,307
You only ever see that bright red thing, huh?

83
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,075
Look at this green too,

84
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,782
And see other worlds too.

85
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,908
It's excessive female hormones, excessive.

86
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,366
And why do you take care of godmother so much?

87
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,324
She's a person who doesn't even give a glance.

88
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,075
How would you know?

89
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,240
- The weight of past years.
- The weight of time.

90
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:02,158
That's right.

91
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,908
Stop wearing that fake watch.

92
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:09,241
- Ugh, the quality is really bad.
- Hey, this is real.

93
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,073
Oh, you're here?

94
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:12,700
- Oh, hello.
- Oh.

95
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,241
Hey, Manager Son, long time no see.

96
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,658
Ah, hyung-nim, shall we talk for a moment?

97
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,741
This isn't extermination, it's just

98
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,200
An emotional revenge hit, isn't it?

99
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,057
No, the other party

100
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,364
Is a complete scumbag who destroyed the soul of a loyal wife of 30 years.

101
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,741
Eliminating such blood-sucking venomous insects,

102
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,783
If that's not extermination, then what is extermination?

103
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,823
Every day, pain accumulates like mileage.

104
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:39,616
It's stacking up steadily, they say.

105
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,408
Did you take anything from the client?

106
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,991
No matter how much I refused, they said to use it for a good cause, what could I do?

107
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,491
They were crying and clinging.

108
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,075
If we don't have this kind of funding,

109
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:53,408
How can our Shinsung Extermination stay in business?

110
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,157
- If the godmother finds out...
- Hyung-nim.

111
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,782
- Flies are pests, right?
- Huh?

112
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,158
Because they always feed on corpses and spread dirty germs.

113
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,198
They are,

114
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,239
Since the Mesozoic Era, traveling across continents,

115
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,698
Diligently spreading pollen,

116
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,491
Maintaining the ecosystem of this Earth we live on.

117
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,116
They are beneficial insects, beneficial insects.

118
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,325
What if it's maggots? What if it's a cesspool?

119
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,991
It becomes food for us.

120
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,783
You just need to collect the ring and bring it back.

121
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:20,408
Let's pretend I didn't hear that.

122
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,950
Hyung-nim.

123
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:18,950
The surgery finished well.

124
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,491
Wow, you did a difficult thing.

125
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,907
When you see injured kids, you feel pity,

126
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,947
But actually getting your hands bloody to rescue them,

127
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:28,450
- It's not easy.
- Then I'll be off.

128
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,724
Excuse me, doctor.

129
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,700
But this one is such an old dog,

130
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,658
Shelters probably won't take him easily.

131
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,533
Adoption is also difficult.

132
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,700
So, there's a high chance he'll be euthanized, you know?

133
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:43,182
So, could you please make a call yourself?

134
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,116
What?

135
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:46,783
If the person who rescued him contacts them directly, they can't refuse easily.

136
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,700
Do you normally do things like this?

137
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,325
Being abandoned because you're old and sick is too cruel, isn't it?

138
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:56,099
He's already been abandoned once, right?

139
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,325
It's okay, it's okay, you'll meet a good person.

140
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,224
Just a moment.

141
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,283
Stay, stay, stay, stay, just stay still.

142
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,575
Yeah, Bobby, why? Bobby.

143
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,991
Um, but does this hurt a lot?

144
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,950
No, I heard that, like, they just cut them open while they're alive.

145
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,198
So there's no scar here,

146
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,658
I'll stitch it up nicely and neatly, so don't worry too much.

147
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:26,948
Oh, save me, save me.

148
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,116
- No blood, you bastard.
- I was wrong.

149
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,783
Argh, you f***ing bastard, you scared me, damn.

150
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:36,616
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,907
No, there's nothing to be afraid of. It's okay, it's okay.

152
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:43,325
Are you perhaps willing to sell a cornea?

153
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:44,782
Suddenly?

154
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,200
This is awkward.

155
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,492
The client pleaded so much.

156
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,892
How much for a pair?

157
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:51,866
5,000 for a kidney,

158
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,324
Including this, I'll add 3 more.

159
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,950
- 3,000?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:00,075
- Ha, 3,000 is a bit...
- Why, why, why?

161
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,282
Look, mister.

162
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:05,366
I'd be one-eyed for life, what can I do with 3,000?

163
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:06,741
Huh?

164
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:10,991
No, the price of glasses has gone up so much, why are eyes still the same as 10 years ago, huh?

165
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:14,991
Alright, then I'll...

166
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:17,950
I'll give you a big one, for real.

167
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:20,608
10.

168
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,490
1 billion?

169
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:22,533
10 seconds.

170
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:24,075
To take your neck.

171
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,158
You son of a bitch!

172
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,492
Argh, you bastard, my eye!

173
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,738
Ah, why, why are you doing this? Ham... Who sent you?

174
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,283
I heard you had an eye plucked out recently, huh?

175
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,325
Scamming other people's clients.

176
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,349
Did Daerim-dong, President Park, did that bastard send you?

177
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,367
Why did best friends cut in line?

178
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,449
You two will meet soon. Reconcile in hell.

179
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,407
Ah, President Park also died, died?

180
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,449
No, still, there must be a purpose for you doing this, a purpose...

181
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,366
Purpose?

182
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,408
To become famous.

183
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,782
A lot of nerves gather here, how is it?

184
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,991
Sa... Save...

185
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,116
I don't know how to do that.

186
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,098
The way I know is,

187
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,283
Slowly and painfully.

188
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,741
Where did he go?

189
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,824
What is it?

190
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,348
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

191
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,740
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Oh, stop!

192
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:27,574
Okay, oh! Stop!

193
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,824
You've trespassed, in someone else's business.

194
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,325
Ah, you're tough, as expected.

195
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:39,729
Did you come here because of the rumors?

196
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,364
President Han, the big shot from Banpo.

197
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:44,950
Chairman Yoon from Dongtan, and today, even President Gu, huh?

198
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,075
Your hands are very skillful like this.

199
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:50,157
Isn't it a waste to only use them for street fights?

200
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,741
Ah, are you a sasaeng fan?

201
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:55,491
Goodbye.

202
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,575
Uh, uh? Wait, wait!

203
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,182
Uh, uh, uh? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

204
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:03,825
Wait, wait, let's talk, huh?

205
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,783
Let's settle with this.

206
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,658
It's expensive for me, are you sure?

207
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,450
Oh, why do you keep doing this when I said no?

208
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,614
Why, why!

209
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,033
That guy is worse than a bug, isn't he!

210
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,533
Then why are you saying no!

211
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,365
Oh, I understand what you're saying, but this isn't that kind of place, really.

212
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,490
Why are you saying no, no?

213
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:54,032
I'll do everything you ask, so please kill him.

214
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,991
Oh, please go, please, ah, go...

215
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,783
Oh, I can't go.

216
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,033
If I can't kill that bastard Hanseong,

217
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,866
My son, my poor son, I can't go.

218
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,450
Please, I beg you...

219
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:32,158
Have you eaten?

220
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,074
If not, let's eat together.

221
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,783
Isn't it annoying?

222
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,033
No, you just do it with the app and it's over.

223
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:52,241
Only godmother is like this.

224
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:56,283
Ugh, when am I going to input all of this?

225
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:59,950
Did you clean up thoroughly?

226
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,283
CCTV, witnesses, anything suspicious?

227
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:07,533
No.

228
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:09,783
Ah, the client is a bit much too.

229
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,116
They could have done it somewhere quiet, but they had to do it where there were so many people.

230
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,290
- And openly asked for extermination.
- Don't worry.

231
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,574
He'll leave on his own before being called a useless eater.

232
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:19,907
So sensitive.

233
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:21,699
Is this the case with the woman at the entrance?

234
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,950
Ah, it's nothing much.

235
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,200
I was introduced to her as Madam Hong.

236
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,866
Her son's girlfriend was scammed by drug addicts.

237
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,366
Died of drug shock.

238
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,616
And her son went to pick her up there and was lynched, now a vegetable.

239
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:40,908
Hmph, it's truly infuriating.

240
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,908
It's delicate in many ways, so Manager Son rejected it, alright?

241
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:50,366
And I've booked a health check-up at Jang Hospital.

242
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,533
Now they say to follow procedures.

243
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,908
It was overtly ostentatious, though.

244
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:02,181
Like saying, 'Recognize me,' huh?

245
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:06,158
Also, circling the target and gnawing away at them as much as possible.

246
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,950
Just before they go crazy,

247
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,807
You work in the most painful way.

248
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:14,575
That's why your nickname is Bullfighter, huh?

249
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,825
Prologue done.

250
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,200
What's the main point?

251
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:20,657
In short, instead of meaningless and unimpressive murders like that,

252
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,283
He's saying we should use our good skills for justified extermination, like us.

253
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:25,991
Extermination.

254
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,907
Is he asking me to catch bugs or something?

255
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:30,658
That's right, cockroach-like beings that plague our society.

256
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,908
To completely eradicate them,

257
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,616
And save those who suffer, that's our job.

258
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,158
Oh my.

259
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,325
Is this the Hall of Salvation?

260
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,741
Hey, I can't just go like this.

261
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:52,699
This bastard!

262
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,408
Oh, I'll kill you before I go.

263
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:59,991
Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

264
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:04,015
Mr. Bullfighter, if you play around, you'll get hurt.

265
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,074
Whoa, whoa.

266
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:11,950
First, I know this place is very serious.

267
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:20,866
Uh, the kid didn't know and just played a little trick.

268
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:22,658
Please just let it go.

269
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:24,866
You should be more selective about who you take.

270
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:45,366
There are many protein precipitates in your cerebrospinal fluid.

271
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,408
Are your limbs trembling or anything like that recently?

272
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,908
No, I'm fine.

273
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,450
Looking at the color here,

274
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:56,740
The signal denaturation is quite severe.

275
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,033
Please don't tell the company for now.

276
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,200
That's difficult.

277
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:04,908
Then today might be the last time we see each other.

278
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,408
What's the next extermination?

279
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,533
You shouldn't overdo it.

280
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,783
When was there something that wasn't overdoing it?

281
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,283
Ah, stubborn old man.

282
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:28,825
Ugh, where did you hide it?

283
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,158
Ugh, damn it!

284
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,783
Just eat quietly, why are you so noisy!

285
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,908
Smell.

286
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,325
Why live? Why live?

287
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:48,783
Why did this fall out?

288
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,409
Who are you!

289
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,906
Why are you doing this? I'll do anything you want!

290
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,658
Those old people must have done everything you told them to too.

291
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:00,700
Why did you kill them?

292
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:02,282
Ah!

293
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:04,807
That old lady Park Gyeong-bok, you mean?

294
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,015
Oh, sir, boss.

295
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:09,949
All of that was dismissed by the police, you know.

296
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:14,449
Why didn't you just get punished by the police instead?

297
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:16,283
Depart.

298
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:49,366
'The train will arrive shortly...'

299
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,283
Dad.

300
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:57,365
Dad.

301
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,283
Eunho.

302
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,616
I'm not Dad.

303
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,992
Eunho, I'm not Dad.

304
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,616
What's wrong? Huh?

305
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:49,991
What's wrong? Making me dizzy.

306
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:53,558
Huh?

307
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,117
You'll be forgetful too when you're my age.

308
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,156
In this accident, a woman in her 40s in the passenger car died.

309
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:09,616
According to witness testimony,

310
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:12,450
before the accident, a man presumed to be the suspect,

311
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,555
lingered around the victim's car for a while.

312
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:18,283
The culprit stopped the car at this intersection,

313
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,950
and knowing a train was coming,

314
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:22,490
left the unconscious victim and got out alone.

315
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:23,950
- Yes.
- Afterwards, the suspect,

316
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,033
- All sorts of things happen.
- chased the witness,

317
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:27,890
and fled after reaching the front of a nearby police station.

318
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,282
Police presume this case to be a murder disguised as a suicide,

319
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,741
and have switched to a public investigation,

320
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:35,658
focusing on securing the identity of the suspect,

321
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:36,908
presumed to be in his mid-50s. Goodbye.

322
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,325
You're 10 minutes early for the appointment?

323
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,366
I'm someone who moves by minutes and seconds.

324
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,973
Didn't Jo Du-hyeon give you prior training?

325
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:56,574
That person is more rude than I thought...

326
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:03,866
What is it?

327
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:27,575
To dishonor Jang-bi Hyung-nim, who dedicated his life to disinfection, like this.

328
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,700
It's not like I'm comfortable with it either.

329
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:33,116
Still, isn't it true that a single pebble can overturn a car?

330
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,741
Rules are rules.

331
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,283
- I'll get a professional.
- I'll do it.

332
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,866
Godmother?

333
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:46,117
Well, if you do that, I'd be grateful.

334
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,199
Godmother, but how will you find him?

335
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,908
That guy's destination is obvious.

336
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:55,781
Anyway, old folks require a lot of effort.

337
00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:57,075
Will it be okay?

338
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,283
The...

339
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:02,116
Weight of time.

340
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,616
Oh, you're here?

341
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:06,991
Oh dear.

342
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,990
Oh, how was it? Was it okay?

343
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,908
Well, I pulled out a bothersome tooth.

344
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:18,899
Doesn't look like you were waiting for me.

345
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,991
Ah, damn it!

346
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,491
What is it?

347
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:28,424
I told you to collect the ring, but you brought the whole finger.

348
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:30,240
Check if there are 28 segments.

349
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,450
Manager.

350
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,533
Can we talk for a moment?

351
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,658
Did the Godmother come to collect me?

352
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,367
What an honor.

353
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:57,991
Why did you do it?

354
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,200
I saw Eunho.

355
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:04,366
Eunho died, 10 years ago.

356
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:12,241
If our Eunho hadn't met that pastor, I wouldn't have been so angry.

357
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:14,700
The world wouldn't have made me angry.

358
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,991
Then my life would have been different, right?

359
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:20,075
I walked because there was a path.

360
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,033
What's so great about living or dying?

361
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:43,075
Just go, please!

362
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:01,723
Kill me before you go.

363
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,116
You think I can't kill you?

364
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:04,950
You think I can't kill you!

365
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,931
I told you not to get excited.

366
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,908
- Your vision halves.
- Don't you know?

367
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,283
Not everyone can live as coldly as you, sis!

368
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:44,991
You ruined the job by being swayed by emotions.

369
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:46,991
So you die according to the rules.

370
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:56,783
Sorry, but I was going to quit after this one!

371
00:32:56,784 --> 00:33:00,075
I was going to open a chicken shop and live by tending to flowers!

372
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,658
So... Ugh!

373
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,200
Ah, I thought I was going to die of boredom.

374
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:11,825
What are you?

375
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:13,991
Who are you?

376
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,700
We must have met before.

377
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,190
Move, this is my business.

378
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:20,241
It's my business too.

379
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:28,806
Did Manager Son send you?

380
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:29,698
To the Lighthouse?

381
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,991
If you had done your job properly, I wouldn't have had to step in like this.

382
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:36,658
They called you a legend,

383
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,325
but your hair is gray and you have wrinkles.

384
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:40,908
How can you be so old already?

385
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:42,491
Shut up.

386
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,699
I don't need it, Lighthouse or whatever.

387
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:51,116
Then you can finish up yourself.

388
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,408
Since it's your job.

389
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,158
When it's time to go,

390
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:02,158
they say the person you missed will come to meet you.

391
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:03,991
My daughter,

392
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,408
said it's enough,

393
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:11,324
and came to meet me, saying Dad did enough.

394
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,116
Hey, ah...

395
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,283
The call is not being answered. After the beep, please leave a message...

396
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,616
Sir, he's not answering again.

397
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:23,532
- Let's just go.
- No, I'll finish the job and go.

398
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,200
What if something happened?

399
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:27,574
He hasn't answered the phone all day.

400
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,158
Never.

401
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,283
I told you not to hold back with the blade.

402
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:33,825
- No matter who the opponent is.
- No matter who the opponent is.

403
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:36,825
You're getting soft by listening to others, so this is what happens.

404
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:39,241
Remember.

405
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:42,783
Don't shoot a butterfly with a gun.

406
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,283
What!

407
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,658
Let's go now.

408
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,366
Don't move. I've given you temporary treatment...

409
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,698
What's the trick?

410
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:33,533
I heard a sudden brake and saw.

411
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:36,616
A car was stopped by the roadside.

412
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,449
I checked just in case, and the elder was there.

413
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:44,158
They fainted, saying absolutely no to the hospital.

414
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:49,365
It's an 8cm laceration, including a stab wound to the right latissimus dorsi,

415
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:51,449
but it's near organs, so if it were a little deeper,

416
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:53,825
you wouldn't be seeing me now.

417
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:58,449
Please forgive me for cutting your clothes with scissors, as the blood was sticking everywhere.

418
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,492
My belongings?

419
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:01,824
I've kept them safe.

420
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,117
You shouldn't do this. You're already bleeding heavily...

421
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,866
Ha, come on, just bear with it for a bit.

422
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:40,825
Today's work,

423
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,658
everyone has their own story.

424
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:57,200
Nurses will be in soon. Wear this.

425
00:39:57,766 --> 00:39:59,116
I'll get you some medicine too.

426
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:44,783
You're a bit late?

427
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,575
They put the Lighthouse on it.

428
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:54,408
Why?

429
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:56,617
Did you not trust me?

430
00:40:58,474 --> 00:41:00,283
Ah, the waves are high.

431
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:03,408
It would be a big problem if our Godmother got swept away.

432
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,283
You're a precious asset of Sinseong Disinfection.

433
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,450
Wow, this is like this.

434
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:11,324
Why isn't the knife sharp?

435
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:22,491
This knife looks a bit dull,

436
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,200
but it still seems quite usable.

437
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:38,408
Looking at the situation,

438
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:42,408
it seems like you're just picking up anyone off the street and making them do this and that.

439
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,866
Our work is a sacred task of eradicating malignant pests.

440
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:50,241
For example, taking ordinary kids and swindling them,

441
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:53,765
and then disinfecting those drug addicts who drove them to death.

442
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:57,158
The jobs you refuse, that's our job.

443
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,365
Ah, this is so frustrating.

444
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:05,158
They are nationwide mafia.

445
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,531
It's like a fugu poison sac where everyone dies if you touch it wrong.

446
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:08,991
So what do you expect me to do?

447
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:12,532
You work so comfortably, weighing and picking.

448
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,865
It's my authority.

449
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:15,795
Authority comes with responsibility.

450
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,823
Then why don't you try it yourself!

451
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:19,033
There's nothing I can't do.

452
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:29,239
And Toro, he's a clean guy, even if you check him thoroughly.

453
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,866
He's skilled.

454
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:34,574
Now, acknowledge him as a colleague and buy him a meal, huh?

455
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:37,283
Now that I see it, your father was very young.

456
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,033
Was that when you were just a snot-nosed kid?

457
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:41,908
Yes.

458
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:45,533
At that time, Godmother was also in her prime, right!

459
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,700
Why are you leaving already? You just got here, stay a bit longer.

460
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,491
Don't you plan to grow your fingernails?

461
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:08,116
What?

462
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:12,324
You used to be flashy. Paint them, do something.

463
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,200
Why?

464
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:18,908
Should I tear your face to shreds?

465
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:27,241
You must have something to do before that.

466
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:31,450
You lay there like a dog and received treatment.

467
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:33,158
Then...

468
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:36,367
You left a witness there.

469
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:41,408
If the company finds out, won't you end up like Jang-bi?

470
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,950
Now I know who you are.

471
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,575
You know?

472
00:43:52,058 --> 00:43:53,307
Me?

473
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:54,200
I know.

474
00:43:55,808 --> 00:43:57,241
The guy who's trying hard to die.

475
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:04,408
Yeah, even if you're past your prime,

476
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,450
they say you're done for if you get on Godmother's bad side, right?

477
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:10,450
There aren't just one or two contractors who follow her.

478
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:15,557
So don't show up in front of me, okay?

479
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:17,075
If you want to live long.

480
00:44:25,391 --> 00:44:27,116
Why don't you be more selective about who you take on?

481
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:33,533
I'll handle it myself, Godmother, okay?

482
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:39,724
Where is this crazy bastard, trying to die?

483
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:42,224
Alright, if it's not money, and it's not justice,

484
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,950
then what on earth is your purpose for being here, huh?

485
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,324
Legend.

486
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,825
You came to the right place, your eyes are good!

487
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:52,075
"A child left alone after their father's death."

488
00:46:52,825 --> 00:46:54,450
"From orphanage to psychiatric hospital."

489
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:08,866
What should I do with you now?

490
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,240
Don't pick at your side dishes, okay, Haeni?

491
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,657
Yes, sir! You do well, Dad.

492
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:54,325
- Alright, have a good trip.
- Jiwoo, Kim Jiwoo.

493
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,032
Hey, aren't you going to clean that up?

494
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:18,199
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Apologize.

495
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,990
- Apologize for what, this person is really...
- Apologize!

496
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:21,699
Someone who knows better, why are you doing this, really!

497
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,031
Ugh, really, stop it!

498
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:25,408
I told you to apologize!

499
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:36,366
- Hello.
- Oh, yes.

500
00:48:42,765 --> 00:48:45,324
Oh, welcome!

501
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:50,699
These peaches just came out, they're as sweet as honey.

502
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:53,515
- Shall we go with that?
- Ah, how many should I give you?

503
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,683
Ah, 4 is enough?

504
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:56,615
That's a bit many?

505
00:48:56,616 --> 00:49:00,783
Oh, when you start eating, 4 goes by quickly.

506
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,574
She's 7, but her skills are good, right?

507
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,533
Yes.

508
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:08,640
Her mom must be an angel.

509
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,492
Yes, she's in heaven.

510
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:13,699
How did...

511
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:16,075
Her surgery relapsed.

512
00:49:16,076 --> 00:49:19,907
She was bedridden for 5 years and then just passed away meaninglessly.

513
00:49:19,908 --> 00:49:23,031
After that incident, our son-in-law can't sleep at night.

514
00:49:23,032 --> 00:49:25,740
So he just goes around working night shifts everywhere.

515
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:28,949
And he does that one-person protest or whatever, that makes no sense.

516
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,115
He's been doing that for years.

517
00:49:31,116 --> 00:49:32,682
He says it's...

518
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:35,741
Courtesy to the dead or something...

519
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,158
Oh dear, I'm talking nonsense again...

520
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,283
I'll give you another one of these overripe peaches.

521
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,491
People don't buy them if they're a bit bruised, but this one's even tastier.

522
00:49:48,492 --> 00:49:51,074
It's really delicious.

523
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:54,450
- I'll enjoy it.
- Come again.

524
00:49:58,266 --> 00:50:00,947
Oh, Haeni? Dad's here!

525
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:02,783
- Huh?
- Haeni.

526
00:50:03,558 --> 00:50:07,281
Dad! Why are you so late?

527
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:08,282
Uh, did you eat?

528
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:10,449
Yes, I missed you.

529
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,533
Haeni, just a moment.

530
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,908
Sir, sir!

531
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,783
Sir.

532
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:26,533
Why did you come?

533
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,950
Our family has nothing to do with it.

534
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:30,824
Why?

535
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,200
Huh?

536
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,366
You must have seen what I carry around?

537
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:39,908
You're a good person.

538
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:42,491
You saved an abandoned child.

539
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:44,658
I'm not a good person.

540
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,491
That's an answer only a good person could give.

541
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:55,199
Is Muyong doing well?

542
00:52:56,516 --> 00:52:57,449
Muyong?

543
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,325
Because he seemed like a brave child, I just...

544
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,825
You really have no talent for naming things.

545
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:10,450
Why don't you go to the hospital?

546
00:53:12,516 --> 00:53:14,283
Afraid of getting fired? From the company?

547
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,450
Must be a scary company if you're 'afraid of getting fired'.

548
00:53:18,808 --> 00:53:21,075
Then if your wound gets worse, make sure to stop by my place.

549
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:24,158
And go for walks with Muyong more often.

550
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,615
I'm not sure what to call you.

551
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:35,866
By any chance, your name is...

552
00:54:17,516 --> 00:54:20,033
Do you also think I'm a good person?

553
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:22,116
Muyong.

554
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:26,116
Yes, from today, your name is Muyong.

555
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:37,158
This prime land has been here for over 40 years already.

556
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,849
How great would it be to tear it all down and build anew?

557
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,742
But it's not as easy as it sounds, is it?

558
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:46,033
In front of herbivores born in this state,

559
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:50,973
there's an old lion stubbornly holding its ground.

560
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:53,283
It seemed like all his claws had fallen out, why?

561
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,740
Has he never made a mistake while hunting until now?

562
00:54:56,741 --> 00:54:59,407
It was perfect. Unbelievably so.

563
00:54:59,408 --> 00:55:03,323
Like a legend that's both adored and feared.

564
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:06,575
Those humans, huh? They can't stand that.

565
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,491
Oh, what on earth happened?

566
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,265
There was an original gentleman named Ryu who first laid the foundation here.

567
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:16,450
Oh, this bastard.

568
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:19,075
I'm late because I came back from performing the 49th-day memorial service.

569
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,742
Just in case our family couldn't leave this world.

570
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:37,491
On that person's death anniversary, to get revenge,

571
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:41,783
she disinfected 28 people all by herself.

572
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:45,658
Our Godmother.

573
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:57,366
After that day, she even changed her name from 'Fingernail' to 'Fragment'.

574
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,950
But when was that, anyway?

575
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:11,950
Expired waste should be disposed of, shouldn't it?

576
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:26,991
Guardian.

577
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:29,682
Hello, Grandma.

578
00:56:29,683 --> 00:56:30,700
Oh, hello.

579
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:33,116
You came out for a walk with Muyong.

580
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,615
Can I play with them?

581
00:56:35,616 --> 00:56:37,324
- Yes, of course.
- Haeni.

582
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:39,283
- Wow.
- Here.

583
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,323
Muyong, let's go.

584
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:43,783
- Haeni, don't go too far.
- Yes.

585
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,158
The child is very...

586
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:49,742
She seems smart.

587
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,325
She takes a lot after her mother.

588
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Did you hear that? To my mother-in-law.

589
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:02,950
A perfectly healthy person, overnight...

590
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:06,824
The hospital director told me.

591
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,449
Anyone trying to profit,

592
00:57:09,808 --> 00:57:12,783
at first, they all talk about sincere apologies and whatnot, really.

593
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,908
At that time, hah...

594
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:19,908
Should I have just bitten my tongue off?

595
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:22,533
Or as much as I wanted to, I just...

596
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:24,283
Do you want to kill them?

597
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:37,948
Would you like to have a meal together?

598
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:40,158
We were already on our way to lunch.

599
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:45,366
No, I just... Oh, you're here?

600
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:49,533
Let's go together. We're all just trying to make a living.

601
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:52,866
Sorry, Grandma, I have to go.

602
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:58,658
Please, let's go together.

603
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,449
I have a presentation next week. Grandma, you should come too.

604
00:58:04,016 --> 00:58:07,490
Oh dear? I can't go to places like that.

605
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:10,574
No! I practiced my dance really hard!

606
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:12,699
Haeni, why are you like this today?

607
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,349
You don't need to worry about it.

608
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,283
Eat quickly.

609
00:58:19,724 --> 00:58:20,658
Fragment.

610
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:23,200
Fragment?

611
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,908
My name.

612
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:29,700
One fragment, two fragments...

613
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:32,700
- Three fragments, four fragments... - Haeni, tsk.

614
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:36,574
It means 'beast's claw'.

615
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:40,574
- Oh, was it? I didn't know. - Look here.

616
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:43,598
Haeni, I told you not to do that without adult permission.

617
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,533
Look at this, it came out well, right?

618
00:58:46,308 --> 00:58:49,116
- Give me your number, I'll send it to you. - Haeni!

619
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:53,991
Ah, I'm sorry.

620
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,866
Oh no, Dad, what about that?

621
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:01,199
Someone must have broken it and ran away.

622
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,908
Isn't that really expensive?

623
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,492
Oh, hello.

624
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:17,824
How did you come?

625
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,200
An old hunting dog...

626
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:27,366
There's one.

627
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,491
It's doing things it wouldn't normally do.

628
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:33,866
Why is that?

629
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:35,533
Huh?

630
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:46,992
Like being swayed by trivial things.

631
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:50,533
Or becoming cowardly.

632
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,240
Or coveting things it didn't eat before.

633
00:59:57,241 --> 01:00:00,991
Ah, if it's psychosomatic, I think you've come to the wrong place.

634
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:05,450
- This is a hospital. - Because it's an animal hospital.

635
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:07,200
Humans too.

636
01:00:08,224 --> 01:00:09,283
Animals.

637
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,116
Aren't they?

638
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,699
That's true, but I can't treat people.

639
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,783
That's strange.

640
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,325
I thought you treated people too.

641
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:30,281
Hello.

642
01:00:30,282 --> 01:00:31,491
Oh, Kkangchi's mother.

643
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:34,534
- He's not eating. - Oh dear, that must be tough.

644
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:35,908
- Come in. - Yes.

645
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,616
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

646
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,907
Oh, Mother, strawberries, I want strawberries!

647
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:53,408
Oh, strawberries are already out of season.

648
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:56,616
What about this Hallabong?

649
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:59,657
This California orange is sweeter.

650
01:00:59,658 --> 01:01:00,949
How is this sweeter?

651
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,157
Mister, this.

652
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,824
I have a presentation next week, please come!

653
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:06,699
Oh dear? Uncle is a bit busy.

654
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:11,283
No! I practiced my dance really, really hard!

655
01:01:11,724 --> 01:01:13,741
- Really? Then let's see. - Oh, good job.

656
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:20,950
- Oh, you're good. - Oh, she's good.

657
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,741
The owner of Haeni Fresh Produce is very clever.

658
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:29,949
What are you doing?

659
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:33,491
No, these are old, wrinkled, and bruised.

660
01:01:33,492 --> 01:01:34,890
But they taste the same.

661
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,241
People don't know and just buy pretty, fresh ones, they say?

662
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:38,825
Mr. Kang's family.

663
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,741
If you touch even a hair on them...

664
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,116
Are you serious?

665
01:01:48,183 --> 01:01:49,325
Wow, that scholar is quite talented.

666
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:55,200
Melting even an icy person.

667
01:01:55,975 --> 01:01:57,950
I'll leave, so stop it.

668
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,658
What?

669
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:04,617
If only I'm gone, there will be no threat to Shinseong Disinfection,

670
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:08,741
and that innocent person will be safe.

671
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,241
I don't want to.

672
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:15,867
How can you put down your knife just for that one person,

673
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,075
and dream of retirement or a normal life or whatever?

674
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:21,783
What, as you get older, what happens?

675
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,783
Like bacteria seeping into cracked skin, something strange invades?

676
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:28,240
Compassion, guilt, what...

677
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:30,533
What, the desire to protect...

678
01:02:30,534 --> 01:02:33,075
What, are those feelings welling up, or what?

679
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:37,992
What is your purpose for being here, huh?

680
01:02:43,516 --> 01:02:44,449
Purpose?

681
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:47,158
It's funny how people are.

682
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:52,033
They don't know where they're going themselves, but they pry into where others are going.

683
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:56,866
Do you even know where you're going right now?

684
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:02,075
Well, anyway.

685
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,867
What does age matter, huh?

686
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:09,491
You have the freedom to look as much as you want.

687
01:03:12,183 --> 01:03:13,450
But you don't have the right, do you?

688
01:03:19,391 --> 01:03:21,158
Hey, huh?

689
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:23,992
Who would buy this for the same money?

690
01:04:21,975 --> 01:04:23,367
Go inside and rest.

691
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:26,367
I'm fine.

692
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,950
I'll look into a new ID and ticket for you.

693
01:04:34,225 --> 01:04:35,491
I don't need it.

694
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,867
I will stay where I want to be.

695
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,533
Do as you please.

696
01:04:44,575 --> 01:04:45,783
But from now on,

697
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,783
neither you nor I

698
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:51,616
should create anything to protect.

699
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:24,658
It's already been 10 years. You've worked hard.

700
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,116
Use that to protect Shinseong Disinfection well.

701
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:02,866
Oh my!

702
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,449
- No, what... - Oh, oh, what is it?

703
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,929
Hey, what are you?

704
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,783
Ugh, why is it like this today?

705
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:15,408
- Oh, Director, Director! - Director, Director!

706
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,408
Director, what's wrong?

707
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,847
Just a moment.

708
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:21,199
- What do we do? - Director!

709
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:25,699
To the emergency room!

710
01:06:27,225 --> 01:06:28,783
- To the hospital quickly! - Are you okay?

711
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:55,807
Is the grudge deep?

712
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:57,908
To hit him in front of a child.

713
01:06:57,909 --> 01:06:58,950
Well,

714
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:03,366
the client's condition is confidentiality, so I can't really tell you...

715
01:07:05,641 --> 01:07:08,824
Why leave Tuu, that obedient guy, and why...

716
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:14,075
did you specifically choose a female contractor, the same age as the victim,

717
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:16,658
that I have to ask you directly?

718
01:07:17,225 --> 01:07:19,950
Rather than someone else stepping in and making a mess,

719
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:22,325
it's better for Godmother to clean it up neatly...

720
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,866
Huh? What, damn.

721
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:48,450
Who is the client?

722
01:07:49,808 --> 01:07:51,866
Oh, Godmother.

723
01:07:52,225 --> 01:07:54,283
Why are you doing this to me!

724
01:07:59,616 --> 01:08:01,616
Why was Kang Bong-hoe targeted?

725
01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:05,617
Anyone who pries gets an instant execution.

726
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:07,991
That's the rule you made, Godmother.

727
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,991
That wasn't made to catch fish.

728
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,408
It's to catch the ocean.

729
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:25,533
You don't even know where the ship is going.

730
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:32,075
The hospital director's son said Kang Bong-hoe killed his mother.

731
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:33,575
So he wants revenge.

732
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:36,099
And he gave us a lot of money.

733
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,783
Kang Bong-hoe is not that kind of person.

734
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,849
It is strange.

735
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,408
He said he was the hospital director's son, but he was wearing a fake watch.

736
01:08:43,975 --> 01:08:45,283
Ugh!

737
01:08:45,284 --> 01:08:48,307
Chief Son said we should just take it because it's money,

738
01:08:48,308 --> 01:08:49,616
but just in case,

739
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:54,366
I did some background checks.

740
01:08:55,391 --> 01:08:57,532
Maid Cheon? This is where she plays, you son of a bitch!

741
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,365
Let's see how much guts you have!

742
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:02,156
- Is this guy bluffing? - Damn, are you scared, are you scared?

743
01:09:02,157 --> 01:09:04,782
Damn, are you gonna do it or quit, you bastard?

744
01:09:04,783 --> 01:09:06,115
All in, you bastard!

745
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:10,324
Ah, you damn son of a bitch, really a dog

746
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:15,408
Ah, who is this bastard? Ah, hey!

747
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:20,074
Kang Bong-hoe, why did you ask to be killed?

748
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,283
Who?

749
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:27,240
Ah, I really don't know, I really don't know.

750
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:28,948
I just did what I was told after getting paid.

751
01:09:28,949 --> 01:09:30,140
By whom?

752
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:34,115
I, I, I did it by phone, by phone, call, call.

753
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:35,782
There's a phone in my back pocket, right?

754
01:09:35,783 --> 01:09:38,033
- Uh, make a call. - Yes.

755
01:09:42,433 --> 01:09:43,407
Oh, why?

756
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:46,156
Ah, yes, some woman is...

757
01:09:46,157 --> 01:09:47,075
Granny.

758
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,325
I don't think you should be playing with the scraps over there right now.

759
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:53,075
What do you want?

760
01:09:53,433 --> 01:09:54,741
Equal destruction?

761
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:58,492
It's almost Mr. Kang's quitting time.

762
01:09:58,807 --> 01:10:00,616
What, should I help you again this time?

763
01:10:33,016 --> 01:10:34,866
Just a moment, just a moment.

764
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:36,741
Ah, thank you.

765
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:44,283
Are you okay?

766
01:11:17,016 --> 01:11:18,866
- Oh, be careful, oh my. - Are you okay?

767
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:37,741
Teacher! No, teacher!

768
01:12:10,183 --> 01:12:12,325
Please don't leave me alone.

769
01:12:20,391 --> 01:12:21,949
I'm sorry.

770
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:33,616
How did you know to come here?

771
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,283
- That's a relief. - Yes?

772
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:50,033
You don't have to worry about us.

773
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:53,241
No, it's not.

774
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:01,949
Excuse me.

775
01:13:04,808 --> 01:13:06,242
Just to me,

776
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,617
don't you have anything to say?

777
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:14,616
You've gotten a little thinner.

778
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,908
Be sure to eat your meals.

779
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,408
How is it? Does your heart beat a little?

780
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:37,491
Why are you making it so complicated?

781
01:13:38,558 --> 01:13:42,075
It's useless if you don't think for yourself.

782
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:46,366
Go and take care of it now, why are you doing this in front of me?

783
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:48,533
Yeah, right.

784
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:52,741
I just want to see a legendary ending, I guess.

785
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,116
- You must be disappointed. - I am disappointed.

786
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:00,866
In myself.

787
01:14:02,975 --> 01:14:05,741
Because I've wandered my whole life trying to find this kind of crappy thing.

788
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:06,783
Stop it.

789
01:14:07,766 --> 01:14:09,783
If it were me, you've already found it.

790
01:14:12,558 --> 01:14:13,450
No.

791
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,742
I haven't found it yet.

792
01:14:18,183 --> 01:14:20,140
The real match isn't this.

793
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:23,098
Retirement? Don't even dream of it, and,

794
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:24,908
you can never beat me.

795
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,825
Because you have something to protect,

796
01:14:29,558 --> 01:14:31,033
and I have nothing to lose.

797
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:34,531
Welcome.

798
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:36,700
- Oh, this place is so nice! - Shall we sit here?

799
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,700
- The scent is so good. - I can't wait any longer.

800
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:07,449
Daughter, no.

801
01:15:09,558 --> 01:15:11,783
Two sons, no.

802
01:15:14,183 --> 01:15:16,241
98, 99.

803
01:15:19,558 --> 01:15:20,491
No.

804
01:15:36,308 --> 01:15:39,241
Ah, the one who was supposed to start working today...

805
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,200
Hello.

806
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,367
Allergy.

807
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:07,433
Give me water.

808
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:10,033
Uh, dinner is...

809
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:11,533
It's fine.

810
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:17,865
When does your father come home?

811
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:21,033
He comes after 12. There are many days he doesn't come home.

812
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:38,241
How long has it been?

813
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:40,575
Ten days?

814
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,617
Aren't you tired?

815
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:48,283
Ah, hey, what the.

816
01:16:48,683 --> 01:16:51,325
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up right away.

817
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:00,240
Oh, what the.

818
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,699
Who untied all my shoelaces?

819
01:17:19,016 --> 01:17:21,491
You're aiming for my back of the head.

820
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,991
Listen carefully.

821
01:17:40,992 --> 01:17:43,783
If I don't come back, you're going out that way.

822
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,742
Don't foolishly wait and starve to death.

823
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,116
Find a new owner, or rummage through trash cans.

824
01:17:52,141 --> 01:17:53,783
Survive somehow.

825
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,866
Just don't get caught by the dog catcher.

826
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,325
Are you saying Han-seong will attack that guy's hideout?

827
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:19,182
I'm going to do what Shinseong Disinfection, as I know it, does.

828
01:18:19,183 --> 01:18:21,574
Killing bugs and saving sick people.

829
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:23,033
That Hong Yeo-sa case,

830
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:26,724
it's not something that will end by disinfecting one drug addict.

831
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:30,182
Why don't you just deal with easy stuff like a veterinarian

832
01:18:30,183 --> 01:18:33,616
and why are you making a fuss about stirring up a hornet's nest again?

833
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:37,533
It's a real war. If you mess with that,

834
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:42,949
even if it's Godmother, it's hard to do it alone.

835
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,823
This is my last disinfection in my life.

836
01:18:44,824 --> 01:18:48,741
Whether I live or die, I'll disappear, so this is your responsibility from now on.

837
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:52,492
If you're so worried about me, attach a lighthouse.

838
01:18:52,932 --> 01:18:54,908
That guy, Tuu.

839
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:00,950
Oh, you suddenly came in like this and told me that, what should I do?

840
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:21,283
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jumi, Jumi.

841
01:19:21,683 --> 01:19:24,783
- Bon appétit! - Itadakimasu!

842
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:29,699
What is it?

843
01:19:31,682 --> 01:19:34,032
Were you happy sucking on other people's tears?

844
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:35,431
It was an old hag?

845
01:19:35,432 --> 01:19:37,866
But what bastard sent this wrinkled old woman!

846
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,075
Who is it?

847
01:19:45,808 --> 01:19:48,033
Oh Gwang-ryeol? Jeon In-deuk?

848
01:19:48,975 --> 01:19:50,117
Surely not Madam Hong?

849
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:58,241
What does it matter who you die by?

850
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:05,367
Why you die is important.

851
01:20:06,641 --> 01:20:07,658
CEO!

852
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:09,325
CEO!

853
01:20:10,058 --> 01:20:10,991
CEO!

854
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:16,325
Hey! Go prepare that old woman's funeral!

855
01:20:18,099 --> 01:20:19,158
Wow!

856
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:20,950
Godmother Jo-gak.

857
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:25,074
This can't be done, no matter what.

858
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:28,324
Even if it's Godmother, this is too dangerous, really.

859
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,408
You'll die if you go, really.

860
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:35,366
Do as you please, damn it.

861
01:20:44,933 --> 01:20:46,741
Hey! Catch that bitch!

862
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:57,075
Catch her, catch her!

863
01:20:59,225 --> 01:21:00,575
Hey, find her quickly!

864
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:03,681
Ah, what is it?

865
01:21:03,682 --> 01:21:04,783
Hey, come quickly!

866
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:24,641
Tuu?

867
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:25,575
Why him?

868
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:26,991
Where is he now?

869
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:31,533
No, are you crazy to push the next ace into mortal danger?

870
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:35,824
And Godmother, there's a quota for compassion for everyone.

871
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:39,325
Veterinarian Kang Bong-hoe, you kept him alive because of a private connection, didn't you?

872
01:21:39,808 --> 01:21:41,700
That's why you gave up on the disinfection too.

873
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:43,241
Tsk.

874
01:21:43,808 --> 01:21:46,408
You've lived too long, Godmother.

875
01:21:58,266 --> 01:21:59,158
Hey!

876
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,783
I got him! He's in front of Room 4!

877
01:22:46,475 --> 01:22:49,783
Damn it, if you're old, just die. Why are you trying so hard to live?

878
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:54,783
Excuse me, Chief Son.

879
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:59,514
This is different. How much money have we poured into this?

880
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:01,740
How could you let the business go to waste, damn it!

881
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:04,116
He should have died several times already.

882
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:07,450
Why are you complaining so much when good fortune has come your way, huh?

883
01:23:08,058 --> 01:23:11,033
Let's meet and settle this... Ah, damn it.

884
01:23:21,058 --> 01:23:23,658
What are you going to do, apologize?

885
01:23:28,349 --> 01:23:30,075
I'm tired, let's just finish this.

886
01:23:31,141 --> 01:23:32,408
You bug.

887
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:34,991
Eat some on your way.

888
01:23:37,933 --> 01:23:40,824
Kids, get some nutrition!

889
01:23:40,825 --> 01:23:43,075
- Wow. - Good.

890
01:24:04,033 --> 01:24:06,158
Hey, do it thoroughly.

891
01:24:11,808 --> 01:24:12,949
Eat a lot.

892
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,408
Oh, grandma.

893
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:38,740
Let's finish quickly and go.

894
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,140
Hey, hey, stop.

895
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,157
Hey, stop! Hey, block him!

896
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:43,908
Hey! I said stop, you jerk!

897
01:24:53,975 --> 01:24:54,992
It's not over yet, is it?

898
01:24:55,766 --> 01:24:57,658
What, is it your son?

899
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,390
Yes.

900
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:01,741
He is family.

901
01:25:25,531 --> 01:25:26,516
Damn it!

902
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:36,241
Where is he, damn it!

903
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,033
Where is he!

904
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,116
Are you okay? Huh?

905
01:25:57,516 --> 01:25:58,741
Ugh, go die!

906
01:26:11,308 --> 01:26:12,283
Are you worried?

907
01:26:13,725 --> 01:26:14,617
Yes.

908
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:18,599
Then attach Tuu as a lighthouse, you yourself.

909
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,159
Chief Son has no intentions.

910
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:25,740
Will Tuu go just because I attach him?

911
01:26:25,741 --> 01:26:27,366
Just do as I tell you.

912
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:54,241
Have a meal before you go.

913
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:56,598
How can you cook in that state?

914
01:26:56,599 --> 01:26:58,950
I can cook a meal for a colleague.

915
01:27:14,016 --> 01:27:14,949
Normal people.

916
01:27:16,142 --> 01:27:17,200
What?

917
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:19,283
Normal people,

918
01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:23,200
they'd eat like this often, wouldn't they?

919
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:26,824
But how did you become an exterminator?

920
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:29,408
Usefulness.

921
01:27:30,183 --> 01:27:32,616
- Huh? - When I was little,

922
01:27:33,016 --> 01:27:34,658
I was so hungry,

923
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,783
I stole and ate some bellflower roots from next door.

924
01:27:39,016 --> 01:27:40,575
But they were wild ginseng.

925
01:27:41,641 --> 01:27:44,700
My family was ruined paying for them,

926
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:46,074
and I was kicked out that way.

927
01:27:46,075 --> 01:27:48,408
I wandered from maid to maid,

928
01:27:49,016 --> 01:27:50,866
often beaten,

929
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,866
abandoned, and running away again.

930
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:55,700
Everyone told me to go die.

931
01:27:56,891 --> 01:27:59,741
That I was a useless woman in this world.

932
01:28:02,975 --> 01:28:05,658
Then, when I was sixteen,

933
01:28:06,391 --> 01:28:09,307
I met someone who accepted me as family.

934
01:28:09,308 --> 01:28:10,825
What's your name?

935
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:12,574
Min Seol-hwa.

936
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:14,557
A pretty name.

937
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:17,325
She fed me, gave me a place to sleep,

938
01:28:17,651 --> 01:28:19,031
and gave me work.

939
01:28:19,308 --> 01:28:20,783
And from that person,

940
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,492
I heard the word 'useful' for the first time.

941
01:28:29,433 --> 01:28:31,224
Don't dodge like that.

942
01:28:31,225 --> 01:28:32,700
If you use your reflexes just any time,

943
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:34,992
you're showing off that you're an exterminator.

944
01:28:35,392 --> 01:28:37,533
Hide it even if your head breaks, understood?

945
01:28:38,058 --> 01:28:39,116
Yes.

946
01:28:39,391 --> 01:28:40,783
Let's stop here for today.

947
01:28:43,266 --> 01:28:46,116
I think this work is sacred.

948
01:28:46,683 --> 01:28:50,408
Each and every one of us is saving this world.

949
01:28:51,183 --> 01:28:52,325
Even if no one knows.

950
01:28:58,058 --> 01:29:00,575
I'm envious. I also had someone like that,

951
01:29:01,558 --> 01:29:03,283
like family.

952
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:04,890
Just for a moment.

953
01:29:05,933 --> 01:29:06,950
How is it?

954
01:29:08,224 --> 01:29:10,075
Do you remember? When we first met?

955
01:29:11,725 --> 01:29:13,700
Was that 25 years ago?

956
01:29:16,558 --> 01:29:17,558
Hello?

957
01:29:33,183 --> 01:29:34,991
I'm sorry, Do-young.

958
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:52,783
Wow, this is touching, isn't it?

959
01:29:54,266 --> 01:29:55,225
Of course.

960
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,658
You must have known why I came looking for you, right?

961
01:30:02,725 --> 01:30:05,033
It's not enough to kill him myself,

962
01:30:05,682 --> 01:30:09,199
so why would I hand over a long-standing revenge to someone else in such a trivial way?

963
01:30:09,682 --> 01:30:11,366
I have to play with him until the very end.

964
01:30:23,408 --> 01:30:25,908
If you just accept everything they give you,

965
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:27,491
you'll end up dead.

966
01:30:28,433 --> 01:30:30,325
Especially when you open your heart to someone you call a colleague.

967
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:38,075
On purpose?

968
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:42,348
Did you fail on purpose?

969
01:30:42,349 --> 01:30:44,324
Knowing I would come?

970
01:30:44,325 --> 01:30:45,241
Fifty-fifty.

971
01:30:46,433 --> 01:30:48,974
But you're definitely the type to find me.

972
01:30:48,975 --> 01:30:50,158
No wonder.

973
01:30:50,766 --> 01:30:51,908
It was too...

974
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,450
messy.

975
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:17,408
Think of it as being scratched by an animal's claw.

976
01:31:17,975 --> 01:31:19,326
See you in hell.

977
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:56,866
I sent the one you cherish to his grave.

978
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,533
I shouldn't have let you in.

979
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,992
When did you ever let me in?

980
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:12,075
I did all this for us,

981
01:32:15,808 --> 01:32:17,615
for Shinseong Disinfection.

982
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:20,366
It was all for us!

983
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:23,367
Yes, you worked hard.

984
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,367
If it were your father,

985
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:32,074
what choice would he make?

986
01:32:40,433 --> 01:32:41,408
You'll do it, right?

987
01:32:42,516 --> 01:32:43,950
All the unfinished business,

988
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,116
burn it all here.

989
01:32:47,724 --> 01:32:49,033
And you leave too.

990
01:32:57,891 --> 01:32:59,658
- Oh, good job. - Hae-ni.

991
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:01,366
Dad.

992
01:33:03,808 --> 01:33:06,783
Ah, whose daughter is that? Huh? Oh dear!

993
01:33:09,391 --> 01:33:11,325
- High five. - Good job, high five.

994
01:33:12,266 --> 01:33:13,408
High five!

995
01:33:14,516 --> 01:33:16,283
- Did you see me? - You did so well.

996
01:33:17,016 --> 01:33:19,574
- Oh dear, no, where did she go? - Mother, I'll see you next time.

997
01:33:19,575 --> 01:33:20,949
- You did so well. - Teacher.

998
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:22,241
Ah, yes, Hae-ni's father, hello.

999
01:33:22,242 --> 01:33:23,699
- Hello, Grandma. - Um, Hae-ni...

1000
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:27,515
Oh, Hae-ni? She left first just a moment ago.

1001
01:33:27,516 --> 01:33:30,431
- Then I'll look for the restroom. - Yes.

1002
01:33:30,432 --> 01:33:32,282
Then I'll look further inside.

1003
01:33:32,283 --> 01:33:35,491
Hae-ni! Hae-ni!

1004
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:51,158
Go.

1005
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:00,241
Gotcha.

1006
01:34:03,933 --> 01:34:06,450
I'm sorry, you grabbed me so suddenly.

1007
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,741
Isn't this wrong? Why even a child?

1008
01:34:11,016 --> 01:34:11,949
What?

1009
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,366
Are you going to pretend you don't see this?

1010
01:34:19,866 --> 01:34:23,783
I thought about it at the gates of hell, and Hae-ni seemed so pitiful.

1011
01:34:26,283 --> 01:34:28,491
It's obvious she'll be left alone like us.

1012
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:31,158
I know that feeling well from experience.

1013
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:34,224
This goes against my principles,

1014
01:34:34,225 --> 01:34:36,367
but I feel so bad that I can't help it.

1015
01:34:37,183 --> 01:34:38,533
This is the problem with humans.

1016
01:34:38,933 --> 01:34:42,033
When they're down, principles and everything else lose meaning.

1017
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:43,825
You understand, right?

1018
01:34:44,308 --> 01:34:45,908
I'll prepare a big party.

1019
01:34:46,266 --> 01:34:47,824
Then only grandma comes.

1020
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:49,390
Happy Land.

1021
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:52,283
Who are you, really? What do you want?

1022
01:34:53,016 --> 01:34:54,616
You absolutely cannot report it.

1023
01:34:55,391 --> 01:34:56,574
I'll bring her back.

1024
01:34:56,575 --> 01:34:57,949
What nonsense are you talking about?

1025
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:59,158
Report it immediately.

1026
01:35:03,599 --> 01:35:04,533
Trust me.

1027
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,908
Hae-ni will be safe.

1028
01:35:08,558 --> 01:35:10,116
He's after me.

1029
01:35:21,766 --> 01:35:24,658
Hae-ni, please... huh?

1030
01:35:35,474 --> 01:35:37,533
Is it because I saved him that day?

1031
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,700
I saved someone I shouldn't have.

1032
01:35:42,641 --> 01:35:43,866
Is that it?

1033
01:35:47,516 --> 01:35:50,574
Even so, I don't regret it. Treating you.

1034
01:35:52,682 --> 01:35:54,324
Because it was the right thing to do.

1035
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:40,616
Why aren't you going?

1036
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:43,658
Goodbye.

1037
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,992
Mu-yong, do you remember what I said?

1038
01:37:36,557 --> 01:37:37,616
Mu-yong!

1039
01:38:47,975 --> 01:38:49,200
Ugh, damn it...

1040
01:38:55,224 --> 01:38:56,825
Check, blind spot rooftop.

1041
01:38:57,225 --> 01:38:58,325
All clear.

1042
01:39:11,475 --> 01:39:12,700
Third floor, third floor!

1043
01:39:23,016 --> 01:39:24,199
Keep your distance, keep your distance.

1044
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,075
It's open!

1045
01:39:32,475 --> 01:39:34,223
Team B entering third floor.

1046
01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:35,325
Cover the third floor.

1047
01:39:45,058 --> 01:39:45,950
Fifth floor!

1048
01:39:46,975 --> 01:39:48,200
Go to the stairs next to you!

1049
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:56,699
Help me!

1050
01:39:58,433 --> 01:40:00,200
Help me!

1051
01:40:23,974 --> 01:40:25,033
Why can't I see him?

1052
01:40:29,016 --> 01:40:30,284
Entering from both sides!

1053
01:40:30,974 --> 01:40:31,858
Come out!

1054
01:42:08,933 --> 01:42:10,366
You don't touch kids.

1055
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,282
That's your only rule, right?

1056
01:42:12,283 --> 01:42:13,408
Don't kick!

1057
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,741
Alright then.

1058
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:27,533
Drop your gun.

1059
01:42:36,575 --> 01:42:38,033
Why is it taking so long?

1060
01:42:38,766 --> 01:42:40,408
I thought I'd die waiting.

1061
01:42:40,807 --> 01:42:44,158
So, what you've prepared is this kind of farce?

1062
01:42:46,891 --> 01:42:49,908
I was worried that the old revenge would end trivially, weren't you?

1063
01:42:50,766 --> 01:42:51,908
Well, I guess.

1064
01:42:52,808 --> 01:42:55,974
The so-called colleagues are just too incompetent.

1065
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:57,699
This bastard, I've been patient enough, you son of a...

1066
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,909
- You young punk, have you no respect? - Lieutenant Lee.

1067
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:01,990
I've pulled all the advance payment. Is there a problem?

1068
01:43:01,991 --> 01:43:04,782
Because of your idiotic actions, all our men died.

1069
01:43:04,783 --> 01:43:06,866
Didn't you know they were bullet shields from the start?

1070
01:43:07,641 --> 01:43:08,658
Say that again.

1071
01:43:15,225 --> 01:43:18,325
Hey, you crazy bitch, do you still think you're the godmother?

1072
01:43:22,308 --> 01:43:23,283
Get up!

1073
01:43:24,266 --> 01:43:25,325
Hey, get up!

1074
01:43:26,016 --> 01:43:26,891
Get up!

1075
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,699
You, damn it!

1076
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:42,408
See? I told you she's not an easy opponent.

1077
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:45,598
I'll go up and give you a generous final payment.

1078
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:46,617
Go safely.

1079
01:43:46,933 --> 01:43:49,158
Ugh, you bastards.

1080
01:43:58,766 --> 01:44:00,283
Why are you acting so disappointingly?

1081
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:13,158
I'll cut off your ears.

1082
01:44:22,683 --> 01:44:23,866
The rest too!

1083
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:37,265
What do I have to do to make you send the child back?

1084
01:44:37,266 --> 01:44:39,949
Send back what? Just take her yourself.

1085
01:44:40,725 --> 01:44:43,867
Why do you keep dragging Mr. Kang into this, between you and me?

1086
01:44:45,516 --> 01:44:48,283
That veterinarian is someone to be protected.

1087
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:52,241
And I'm trash that needs to be cleaned up?

1088
01:44:55,016 --> 01:44:56,116
Seems so.

1089
01:45:05,558 --> 01:45:06,741
Why are you doing this to me?

1090
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,616
And you, you're the one who is

1091
01:45:10,558 --> 01:45:12,325
discarded waste, aren't you?

1092
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:15,199
Because you're old and useless.

1093
01:45:19,266 --> 01:45:22,533
Someone said that when someone gets old and useless,

1094
01:45:23,266 --> 01:45:25,158
they shouldn't be thrown away.

1095
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:32,200
You can never protect Mr. Kang.

1096
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,431
Because I'm going to kill him.

1097
01:45:34,432 --> 01:45:35,949
All his family too.

1098
01:45:41,766 --> 01:45:43,283
How are you going to protect anything like that?

1099
01:45:51,641 --> 01:45:52,908
Grandma, ah!

1100
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,700
If you keep this up,

1101
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,283
I'll throw her first.

1102
01:46:02,516 --> 01:46:04,574
- No! - You bastards, you're all dead!

1103
01:46:04,575 --> 01:46:06,325
Ugh, damn it.

1104
01:46:13,808 --> 01:46:15,075
What to do?

1105
01:46:15,475 --> 01:46:17,450
The winner gets to ride in grandma's car, huh?

1106
01:46:19,891 --> 01:46:21,117
You learned wrong.

1107
01:46:23,058 --> 01:46:25,158
If you treat others like bugs,

1108
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:27,908
you become as insignificant as a bug yourself.

1109
01:46:31,683 --> 01:46:34,575
Sorry, I'm self-taught.

1110
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,533
Can I kill her?

1111
01:46:40,558 --> 01:46:43,158
Oh, weren't you planning not to?

1112
01:47:03,891 --> 01:47:04,867
Look where.

1113
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:17,408
What, is it over?

1114
01:47:23,975 --> 01:47:25,075
You don't like it?

1115
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:33,307
When does your dad come home?

1116
01:47:33,308 --> 01:47:35,950
He comes after 12.

1117
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:37,950
And there are many days he doesn't come home.

1118
01:47:40,725 --> 01:47:42,658
You should go to sleep now, okay?

1119
01:47:44,058 --> 01:47:47,306
By the way, what music are you listening to?

1120
01:47:47,307 --> 01:47:49,074
Oh, this?

1121
01:47:50,725 --> 01:47:52,075
Listen to this when you're having a hard time.

1122
01:47:58,808 --> 01:47:59,908
This...

1123
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:01,950
This isn't right.

1124
01:48:07,683 --> 01:48:09,033
Are you giving this to me?

1125
01:48:21,725 --> 01:48:23,700
Isn't two a bit unfair?

1126
01:48:24,141 --> 01:48:25,116
Should I throw one away?

1127
01:48:25,682 --> 01:48:28,116
As you please, but you'll regret it.

1128
01:48:43,825 --> 01:48:45,492
I definitely returned it.

1129
01:48:48,725 --> 01:48:49,824
Thanks for that.

1130
01:49:00,891 --> 01:49:01,865
Bae Do-young.

1131
01:49:01,866 --> 01:49:04,531
When your father comes home with money,

1132
01:49:04,532 --> 01:49:06,116
didn't I tell you to come out immediately and

1133
01:49:06,117 --> 01:49:09,198
greet him, huh, you bastard!

1134
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:12,346
Who do you take after to be so weak?

1135
01:49:12,347 --> 01:49:14,158
You idiot!

1136
01:49:14,765 --> 01:49:15,658
Boss!

1137
01:49:17,683 --> 01:49:18,991
What is it, damn it!

1138
01:49:42,724 --> 01:49:44,950
You're a legend, is this all you can do?

1139
01:49:55,225 --> 01:49:56,240
This is emergency report 112.

1140
01:49:56,241 --> 01:49:59,782
I've been kidnapped. Please call my dad.

1141
01:49:59,783 --> 01:50:03,741
Kang Hae-ni. Please track my location quickly and rescue me... Ah!

1142
01:50:25,266 --> 01:50:26,408
Always remember this.

1143
01:50:26,806 --> 01:50:28,700
This is the seed sown by the old woman. I'm not like others, I keep my promises.

1144
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:33,574
I'm not like others, I keep my promises.

1145
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:35,075
Promise?

1146
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,450
Have a good trip.

1147
01:50:54,574 --> 01:50:56,908
Still don't know? How foolish.

1148
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,616
Are you stalling for time?

1149
01:51:09,641 --> 01:51:10,741
Because of her?

1150
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:20,158
Please.

1151
01:51:22,058 --> 01:51:23,366
Look at me.

1152
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,117
Me!

1153
01:52:21,266 --> 01:52:22,950
Don't be too upset.

1154
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,242
I think I'll be joining you soon.

1155
01:52:26,058 --> 01:52:27,200
Finally,

1156
01:52:29,058 --> 01:52:29,991
you've arrived.

1157
01:52:42,683 --> 01:52:44,908
This time, I won.

1158
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:46,950
Because I'm

1159
01:52:48,183 --> 01:52:49,158
leaving

1160
01:52:50,933 --> 01:52:52,783
before you.

1161
01:53:08,433 --> 01:53:09,741
- Have a good trip. - Yes.

1162
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:14,241
Make sure to take your lunch medicine.

1163
01:53:17,142 --> 01:53:18,742
Why were you nice to me?

1164
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,075
Even though you wouldn't

1165
01:53:25,933 --> 01:53:27,408
recognize me.

1166
01:53:32,558 --> 01:53:33,740
Do-young, where are you going?

1167
01:53:33,741 --> 01:53:34,783
To get my indoor shoes.

1168
01:53:46,725 --> 01:53:48,241
You didn't see anything.

1169
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,075
Forget it.

1170
01:53:51,308 --> 01:53:52,950
Can't I come with you?

1171
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:56,742
Next time, when you're a little older,

1172
01:54:07,182 --> 01:54:08,116
I'll

1173
01:54:08,475 --> 01:54:09,783
come find you.

1174
01:54:14,808 --> 01:54:15,741
Promise.

1175
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,742
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1176
01:54:36,975 --> 01:54:38,616
Because I was scared.

1177
01:54:40,391 --> 01:54:41,658
What if you don't

1178
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,617
remember?

1179
01:55:04,849 --> 01:55:06,575
Do you remember everything now?

1180
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,034
Yes.

1181
01:55:14,391 --> 01:55:15,408
How?

1182
01:55:15,724 --> 01:55:17,533
When a person is about to die,

1183
01:55:18,266 --> 01:55:21,533
their life flashes before their eyes.

1184
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:24,450
Promise me.

1185
01:55:25,141 --> 01:55:27,616
The day will surely come when you'll be stronger than your dad.

1186
01:55:29,308 --> 01:55:31,533
Until then, live with a knife in your heart.

1187
01:55:33,308 --> 01:55:34,575
Sleep well tonight.

1188
01:55:36,349 --> 01:55:37,991
Tomorrow will be better.

1189
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:41,116
Together?

1190
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,075
What?

1191
01:55:43,517 --> 01:55:44,991
Can't we go to Happyland?

1192
01:55:45,432 --> 01:55:46,491
Happyland?

1193
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,992
The amusement park.

1194
01:55:50,016 --> 01:55:52,783
All my friends bragged about going.

1195
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:54,450
No?

1196
01:56:05,766 --> 01:56:06,742
Shall we?

1197
01:56:09,308 --> 01:56:10,575
Liar.

1198
01:56:11,975 --> 01:56:13,742
You didn't answer.

1199
01:56:17,475 --> 01:56:18,741
It seems

1200
01:56:19,475 --> 01:56:20,491
your time

1201
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,658
to go

1202
01:56:25,891 --> 01:56:27,408
hasn't come yet.

1203
01:56:33,516 --> 01:56:34,700
Now,

1204
01:56:35,891 --> 01:56:37,825
do you know how to swallow pills?

1205
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:12,242
This is our new family member.

1206
01:57:36,933 --> 01:57:38,016
Ryu.

1207
01:57:39,016 --> 01:57:42,533
It's not because you created something to protect.

1208
01:57:47,308 --> 01:57:48,616
In the end, we are all just

1209
01:57:48,975 --> 01:57:51,783
beings that break and disappear, aren't we?

1210
01:57:52,975 --> 01:57:55,492
Dad, why did you come home so early today?

1211
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:00,450
But living with that loss

1212
01:58:01,183 --> 01:58:02,700
doesn't seem so bad.

1213
01:58:06,391 --> 01:58:08,408
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

1214
01:58:09,891 --> 01:58:11,074
- Amen! - Amen!

1215
01:58:11,075 --> 01:58:13,824
Even though I was in prison,

1216
01:58:13,825 --> 01:58:16,157
the people who sued me,

1217
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:18,449
the two-faced bastards,

1218
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:19,992
whoever they were,

1219
01:58:19,993 --> 01:58:23,199
not once did I resent them.

1220
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,366
- Amen! - Amen!

1221
01:58:25,491 --> 01:58:27,240
Hey, husband, today

1222
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:29,617
you need to keep our Mihyang warm.

1223
01:58:30,391 --> 01:58:31,908
And not yet, Ryu,

1224
01:58:32,308 --> 01:58:36,158
it seems your time to go hasn't come yet.

1225
01:58:42,308 --> 01:58:44,158
There's a lot to do.

1226
