1
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,720
If you want revenge,

2
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,679
count me in.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
At worst, we can join forces.

4
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,119
and kill every member of Tianluo one by one.

5
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,919
But

6
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,479
if our hands are also stained with blood,

7
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:22,039
how are we any different from the villains of Tianluo?

8
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,559
Lord Dugu, please

9
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,960
show mercy.

10
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,199
Let them go.

11
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,279
I am willing to bear it alone.

12
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,919
One hundred thousand.

13
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,160
I will offer Tianluo one hundred thousand Chiwen every year.

14
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,240
That will ensure the safety of Tiebi Ku.

15
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,559
Thank you for sparing us.

16
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,080
Thank you for sparing us.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,600
Why are you so slow to react today?

18
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,960
I even walked up behind you,

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,919
and you still didn't notice.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,399
I was thinking about something.

21
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,119
You're worried about Sima Kong, aren't you?

22
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Don't worry.

23
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,240
The people from Dianchasi won't catch him.

24
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,320
Have some water.

25
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,919
I just fetched it from the river.

26
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,520
Actually,

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,839
this time at the Iron Wall Vault,

28
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,520
I discovered something.

29
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,880
I heard that the Assassin Alliance

30
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,880
has two top assassins who accepted a secret contract.

31
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,360
They're not only after Lu Jiu,

32
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,479
even your name is on their list.

33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
This job is just too dangerous.

34
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,399
How about, Young Master,

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,600
you leave for now?

36
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,320
We'll observe from the shadows.

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,839
I'm afraid that before I can uncover the truth,

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,119
someone has already leaked my whereabouts.

39
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,279
I have no intention of betraying you, Young Master.

40
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
You and I are both members of the Tang Clan.

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
If Master asks about anything,

42
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,919
it's understandable for you to answer truthfully.

43
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,480
The young master truly doesn't blame Old Yan.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,640
If you really wanted to kill me,

45
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,959
you wouldn't have sent a secret dart in the Iron Wall Vault

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,559
to warn me.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,320
How did you know it was me?

48
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,679
Master is best at

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
making decisive moves without showing any emotion.

50
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,119
How would he give a useless person

51
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,600
a chance to turn things around?

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,519
After all, you are the young master.

53
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
The sect leader has high expectations for you.

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,279
As long as we complete the mission on time,

55
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,440
we can act as if nothing ever happened.

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
Master has always been strict.

57
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,079
Will he really act as if nothing happened?

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,119
The sect leader loves you deeply

59
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,160
and is strict with you because of it.

60
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:49,959
But

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
now, for someone destined to leave,

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
you're getting too emotionally involved.

63
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,040
It's not worth it.

64
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,440
You might even

65
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,359
fall into the other person's trap.

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Someone destined to leave.

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
So this is what you found in the Iron Wall Vault.

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,959
Yes.

69
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,119
According to what the shopkeeper said,

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
I am

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,559
the same person as the owner of the jade pendant and waist token.

72
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
the same person.

73
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,399
Then this tiger claw

74
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,040
should be what I took from there before I lost my memory.

75
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,519
Judging by the blade,

76
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,440
it does match the tiger claw marks on the tomb.

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,279
This tiger claw

78
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,079
is forged from refined steel.

79
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,079
It's quite expensive.

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,079
The Lu family

81
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,679
could afford it.

82
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,920
But the Lu family doesn't have anyone who practices martial arts.

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,440
They wouldn't spend a lot of money on weapons.

84
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,160
Look,

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,760
the gaps in the handle are filled with dust.

86
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,720
It must have been stored in the Iron Wall Vault for many years.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
But the blade is still sharp.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,799
It has a hook.

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,959
It resembles a tiger's claw.

90
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,799
Tiger's claw.

91
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,720
Ordinary weapons aren't designed like this.

92
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,640
That's right.

93
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
With this design, when slashing,

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480
even if you aren't hit directly,

95
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,839
it will still tear off a piece of flesh.

96
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,799
It's an excellent weapon for assassination.

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,519
Assassination.

98
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,359
Mm.

99
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,119
In recent years,

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,279
I've reviewed all kinds of case files across the country.

101
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
I've seen them all.

102
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,119
I've never seen any records about this kind of tiger's claw.

103
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,839
So, in that case,

104
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
the clue

105
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,640
is lost again, isn't it?

106
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,559
Sima Kong is familiar with all kinds of weapons.

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,440
Let's ask him when he returns.

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,959
However,

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Sima Kong said he went out to buy something.

110
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,359
Why hasn't he come back yet?

111
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:46,920
This...

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
There's also a property deed.

113
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,760
We were supposed to show it to him when he returned.

114
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,480
This property deed—

115
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
Is there something special about it?

116
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,119
Does it have any connection to the tiger's claw blade?

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Are they related?

118
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,000
Lu Jiu, what's wrong?

119
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,679
Is something wrong with your body—

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,559
Are you experiencing new symptoms again?

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,119
I feel

122
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,799
my senses

123
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,760
are much stronger than before.

124
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,079
Everything around me

125
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,959
can't escape my eyes.

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
And ears, too.

127
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,119
So, do you know where this house is?

128
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,519
Yes.

129
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,640
Then let's wait for Sima Kong to come back.

130
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,559
We'll go look for it together.

131
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,200
No.

132
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,160
Just the two of us will go.

133
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,119
Sima Kong said before that he came to help me

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,359
because of money.

135
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,160
But just now at the Iron Wall Vault,

136
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,519
the shopkeeper

137
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,079
said he has over two thousand Chiwen.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
He must have another motive.

139
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,519
Lu Jiu,

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,359
why do I feel like you've become so suspicious lately?

141
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,679
Sima Kong has been through life and death with us.

142
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,160
No matter his reasons, you shouldn't doubt him.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
You're right.

144
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,839
Maybe I'm just overthinking.

145
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:27,839
But

146
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,079
we don't know when he'll be back.

147
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,119
How about

148
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
we go over there first

149
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,039
and leave him a note?

150
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
When he sees the address,

151
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,200
he'll come over.

152
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

153
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
This is the place.

154
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
Such a hidden spot.

155
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,640
If you hadn't led the way,

156
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,799
I definitely wouldn't have found it.

157
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,559
This place is isolated from the world

158
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,719
and easy to escape from.

159
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,440
It's a great place to hide.

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,679
I'll go in with you.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
With me here,

162
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,799
don't worry.

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,039
Fei Ying

164
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,000
I brought you some white sugar cakes.

165
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,599
Who are you?

166
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,359
Why do you call me Fei Ying?

167
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:55,840
Lu Jiu

168
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
Who are you talking to? Me?

169
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,719
It's nothing.

170
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,520
Let's go inside and take a look.

171
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,559
Okay.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
It seems like no one has lived here for a long time.

173
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,359
Feng Lei Hall, Li Chu

174
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,400
So you're in the same line of work.

175
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,400
Young man,

176
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,760
You don't look very old.

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,039
I won't take advantage of you.

178
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,200
The treasures in this tomb today,

179
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,760
how about we split them evenly?

180
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
I, Fei Ying,

181
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,039
never share with anyone.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,919
Spare me, young hero!

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,599
I have elders and children to care for.

184
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,520
If it weren't for feeding my family,

185
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,640
who would do such a dishonorable thing?

186
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,239
My life doesn't matter.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,239
If you must kill me,

188
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,880
please take these two buns

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,479
and deliver them to my family.

190
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,440
They haven't eaten in days.

191
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,919
Kindness

192
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,080
is the most useless thing in this world.

193
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,679
These lashes

194
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,640
are your lesson for disobeying my orders.

195
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,599
A Tianluo assassin

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,239
must never make a single mistake.

197
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,919
Do you realize your mistake?

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Fine.

199
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,719
What a stubborn one you are.

200
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,400
Earlier,

201
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,640
you let that tomb raider go.

202
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,239
I've already sent someone to deal with it.

203
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,080
Being soft-hearted

204
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,760
is completely useless.

205
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,239
Previously,

206
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,679
at the Iron Wall Vault,

207
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,359
you used the Ten Thousand Year Tribute to save a life.

208
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,599
That was your idea too, wasn't it?

209
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,200
The father is a traitor,

210
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,400
and the son is just as ungrateful.

211
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,760
You'd better remember this.

212
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,080
Tianluo raised you into an adult.

213
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,520
Taught you martial arts.

214
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,640
Don't forget.

215
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,919
Who your master is.

216
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,359
Father.

217
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,599
You taught us.

218
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,320
That achieving the goal

219
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
is more important than the means used.

220
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
Since Feiying

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
has already brought back the items you specified,

222
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,239
please show some mercy, Father.

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
Are you alright?

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,799
Senior sister.

225
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,760
Go away.

226
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,799
Get lost.

227
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,119
I'm whipping you

228
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,239
so you'll learn your lesson.

229
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,200
Lu Jiu

230
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,799
Your movements are getting faster and faster now.

231
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,960
Just like a shadow.

232
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,119
A shadow.

233
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,440
Could it be that I really am Fei Ying?

234
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,159
Lu Jiu

235
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,799
Today, you're doomed.

236
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,000
Go.

237
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,679
Go.

238
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,799
Lu Jiu

239
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,039
Luckily, I have you.

240
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:35,880
Stop!

241
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,359
Lu Jiu

242
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,719
Sima Kong, stop!

243
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,919
Lu Jiu is not in his right mind right now, don't hurt him.

244
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,320
Lu Jiu, look.

245
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,159
He's our friend, not our enemy.

246
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,880
He's a friend we've been through life and death with.

247
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,960
Sima Kong...

248
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,599
Who's friends with him?

249
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,799
At a time like this,

250
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Can't you say something honest for once?

251
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,679
I, Sima Kong, am all alone.

252
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,599
I don't need sincerity.

253
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,799
Lu Jiu

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
I know everything you're doing right now

255
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,559
isn't what you truly want.

256
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,599
As long as I'm by your side,

257
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,320
you won't forget who you really are.

258
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,679
What just happened?

259
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,960
Lu Jiu

260
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
You're awake.

261
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
That's great.

262
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,119
I...

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
As long as you're okay,

264
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,200
nothing else matters.

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,359
He's fine,

266
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,080
but I almost died.

267
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,479
Sir

268
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,200
How do you still have the leisure to go shopping?

269
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,239
Shouldn't we be chasing Lu Jiu?

270
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,200
How are we supposed to chase them?

271
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,119
I don't even know where they went.

272
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
But we can't just sit and wait.

273
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,320
Who said I'm just waiting?

274
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,359
Do you have a plan?

275
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,919
I knew you were hiding your true abilities.

276
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,880
What should we do next?

277
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,799
I'll follow your lead.

278
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,760
Then let's

279
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,000
eat something first.

280
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,520
Ah

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,839
Lu Jiu

282
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,439
Sima Kong, stop!

283
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,680
Lu Jiu isn't in his right mind right now, don't hurt him.

284
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,359
Why do I feel so sad?

285
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,680
The sect leader towards you

286
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,920
loves you deeply and is strict with you.

287
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,760
But

288
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,839
you're getting too attached to someone who's destined to leave.

289
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,479
You're investing too much emotion.

290
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,800
It's not worth it.

291
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,719
You might even

292
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,599
fall into their trap.

293
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,839
You just recovered.

294
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,319
Why aren't you resting inside?

295
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,239
Look.

296
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,680
I found some bamboo shoots for you.

297
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll cook them for you tonight.

298
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,400
Don't hide it.

299
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,160
I saw everything.

300
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,439
Are you talking about this?

301
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,560
I got this when I was digging for bamboo shoots just now.

302
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,640
I fell and hurt myself.

303
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,839
It has nothing to do with you.

304
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
I remember how I hurt you.

305
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,079
I remember it all.

306
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
That wasn't you.

307
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't blame you.

308
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,439
But I blame myself.

309
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,640
Last time,

310
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,199
I made you dislocate your joint.

311
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,839
This time I made you bleed.

312
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know how I'll hurt you next time.

313
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,800
Don't let yourself be scared

314
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,199
by things that haven't happened yet.

315
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,800
Things like that are bound to happen.

316
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,239
I know myself.

317
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
Lately, the frequency of becoming that person

318
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:52,920
is getting higher and higher.

319
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,040
The level of being out of control

320
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
is also getting worse.

321
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
I feel

322
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,439
like I'm about to be swallowed up.

323
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,280
No,

324
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
you won't be swallowed up.

325
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,000
You're just using him to protect yourself

326
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
and to protect us too.

327
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:04,880
Did you forget

328
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,719
if it weren't for you,

329
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,359
I would have been killed by Li Mu long ago.

330
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,119
If I protect myself by killing,

331
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,199
then I'll keep killing in the future.

332
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,599
I'll become a murderous monster.

333
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,800
You should stay away from me.

334
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,520
It's better for you and for me.

335
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,400
In my heart, you're still the pure Lu Jiu.

336
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,839
You won't become a bloodthirsty killer.

337
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,319
But why should you believe me?

338
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,719
Because of this.

339
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,599
You said

340
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
this is the most important picture to you.

341
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,280
I believe that in the future,

342
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,239
we'll have many more beautiful memories.

343
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,599
It's just a torn painting.

344
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,719
It can't change anything. My painting.

345
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,439
Linlang,

347
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
I can only use this way

348
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
to make you stay away from me.

349
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,239
Only this way

350
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,280
will you be safe.

351
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,000
I found it.

352
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,199
Linlang

353
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,479
How did you end up like this?

354
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,599
I'm fine.

355
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,079
I just went to the river to wash vegetables,

356
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,880
and accidentally fell in.

357
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,839
You're never careless when you do things.

358
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,680
Tell me,

359
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,079
what really happened?

360
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,719
Did he bully you again?

361
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,000
I knew it.

362
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,719
He's the type to burn bridges after crossing.

363
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,839
I just didn't expect

364
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,280
he'd treat me like this,

365
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,640
and you as well.

366
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,640
Today, I must teach him a lesson.

367
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,199
There's no burning bridges here.

368
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,680
Before Lu Jiu and I came here,

369
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,920
we left you a note.

370
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,280
So,

371
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
you never thought of abandoning me?

372
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,599
Abandon you?

373
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,839
How could we ever abandon you?

374
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,880
You two...

375
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,880
Write down the most important things you want to remember

376
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,199
on this.

377
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,839
That way, you won't forget.

378
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,439
As long as I keep drawing Linlang's portrait,

379
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,280
I'll never forget her.

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,439
Fei Ying

381
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,319
I brought you some white sugar cake.

382
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,280
Father,

383
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,160
you taught us

384
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:33,920
that achieving our goal

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,040
is more important than the means we use.

386
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:36,839
Since Fei Ying

387
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,439
has already brought back the assets you specified,

388
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,040
please show some leniency, Father.

389
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,520
Young Master Wen, please come in.

390
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,079
The goods are excellent this time.

391
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,520
Young Master.

392
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,400
If you don't want your pretty face

393
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,400
to get burned,

394
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,199
then you'd better confess honestly.

395
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,479
Who are you taking orders from?

396
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,560
If you don't tell me,

397
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,839
I'll cut off your hands and feet

398
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,439
and turn you into a human pig to be sold to Gushan.

399
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,599
Such a beautiful face,

400
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,760
if put on display for people to admire,

401
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,760
would be just perfect.

402
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,640
Since I'm so good-looking,

403
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,839
wouldn't it be better to keep my hands and feet for you to play with?

404
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,199
Wouldn't that be even better?

405
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,959
That's actually not a bad idea.

406
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,280
Come.

407
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,959
So...

408
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,479
So you were pretending.

409
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,800
W-what are you doing?

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
What do you want?

411
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,520
You... you're with Tianluo.

412
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,319
It's my fault.

413
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,640
I deserve this.

414
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,520
Miss,

415
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,880
as long as it makes you feel better,

416
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,119
you can cut off my hands,

417
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,560
turn me into a human pig,

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
and sell me to Gushan if you want.

419
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,079
Please, miss, spare me.

420
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,319
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,680
Father,

422
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,959
the spy just reported

423
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,760
that Xiaojiu has arrived at the bamboo house.

424
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,359
The Wuxiang treasure is about to see the light of day again.

425
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,119
Congratulations, Father! Congratulations!

426
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,680
Sir

427
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,040
We've been out shopping from day to night.

428
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,239
Is the wind you're waiting for still not here?

429
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,839
Aren't you the one who loves shopping the most?

430
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,319
But this time, you don't seem happy.

431
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:46,000
I've already grown a lot by following you, Sir.

432
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,000
Eating and drinking aren't as important as solving cases.

433
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,719
You're the one who said that.

434
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,239
Things are about to get busy now.

435
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,640
Sir

436
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,520
They actually went there.

437
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,760
It's just a bamboo hut.

438
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,880
What's so special about it?

439
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,680
Many years ago,

440
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,680
I once went there to pursue Fei Ying.

441
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,599
I've been there before.

442
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,839
Fei Ying was just a death servant of Tian Luo.

443
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
What skills did he have

444
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,599
to make you investigate him personally, Sir?

445
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Back then, I found out

446
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,920
that Dugu sent Fei Ying

447
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,040
to rob tombs for gold.

448
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:19,239
It was all to look for clues to the Wuxiang treasure.

449
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,199
But in the end, he suddenly disappeared.

450
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,319
So you had to confront Dugu.

451
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,400
At that time,

452
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,160
I was as naive as you, thinking

453
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,959
that the Investigation Bureau was just following orders to investigate Tian Luo.

454
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,199
It was our duty.

455
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,719
But I never expected

456
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
that my disciple

457
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,359
would lose his life to Dugu's men.

458
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
Anyone who offends Tian Luo

459
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,479
will be torn to pieces.

460
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,400
That's why

461
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,040
you refused to take me as your disciple before.

462
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,640
Dugu holds overwhelming power over the court.

463
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,400
The matter of murdering the officials of the Inspection Bureau

464
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,760
was all suppressed by him.

465
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,079
This time,

466
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,040
we must not let him commit evil again.

467
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,760
Stay away from me.

468
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Being good to you

469
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,319
is also being good to myself.

470
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,119
If this

471
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,839
can make you feel a little better,

472
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,719
then I’ll just watch you from afar.

473
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,560
What are you doing here?

474
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,079
Admiring the moon.

475
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,280
Admiring the moon.

476
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,520
I’ve been feeling tense lately.

477
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,920
I haven’t had the mood

478
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,359
to admire the moon like this for a long time.

479
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,199
Having you by my side

480
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,599
is really nice.

481
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,040
I—I’m also very happy

482
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,680
to have a friend like you.

483
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:27,880
Linlang

484
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,079
You've worked in the government for many years.

485
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,319
You've met a lot of people.

486
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,800
There's something I'd like to ask you.

487
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,000
What is it?

488
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,239
I...

489
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,239
No, it's about a friend of mine.

490
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,479
Besides me and Lu Jiu,

491
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
do you have any other friends?

492
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,520
It's a client.

493
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,439
I've worked with him a few times.

494
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
So we have some acquaintance.

495
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,839
Earlier today, I was

496
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,359
near the Tiebi Warehouse and ran into him.

497
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,640
No wonder we waited so long for you on the hill.

498
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,439
What's going on with him?

499
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,800
He's been troubled lately.

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,479
Often because of someone,

501
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,199
he feels either happy or sad.

502
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,079
He can't control his feelings.

503
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,239
Then he

504
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,839
must have fallen for that person.

505
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
You are my father.

506
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,599
Why

507
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,599
in the face of wealth that rivals a nation,

508
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,400
so-called family ties mean nothing?

509
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,160
This is the first lesson your father teaches you.

510
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,479
It might also be the last.

511
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,280
No!

512
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,560
Who exactly is that person?

513
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,599
Why would he call him father?

514
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,560
Father clearly...

515
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,640
Son.

516
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,719
Son, why are you here?

517
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,959
I've been looking for you everywhere.

518
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,560
I've finally found you.

519
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,880
Which memory is real?

520
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,520
What are you doing?

521
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,520
For Linlang.

522
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,719
Do you know how much Linlang has done for you?

523
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,199
Even if you’re lost because of another layer of memory in your body,

524
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,160
that’s still no excuse for hurting Linlang.

525
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,560
I know.

526
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,400
I’ve let Linlang down.

527
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,160
What are you doing now?

528
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,160
This punch

529
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,160
is for me.

530
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,560
You’re ungrateful.

531
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,599
You dumped me.

532
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,560
You deliberately hid your plan to come here.

533
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
I clearly left a note on the hill.

534
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,560
What note?

535
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,119
There was nothing when I got there.

536
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,359
Then how did you end up here?

537
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,119
You did something to me.

538
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,119
And you claim to have an amazing sense of smell.

539
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,839
Yet you didn’t notice

540
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,040
I put tracking scent on you.

541
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,760
I thought

542
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,079
I picked up the scent at the Iron Wall Vault.

543
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,000
Speaking of the Iron Wall Vault,

544
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,760
when Linlang was being bothered by Geng Zhao,

545
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,800
what were you doing?

546
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,560
Your reaction was unusual.

547
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,239
If you have time to suspect me,

548
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,760
you should think about the mysteries surrounding yourself.

549
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Have you never wondered

550
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,479
why your transformation this time

551
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,599
was so intense?

552
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,160
Let me tell you,

553
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,920
the owner of this house

554
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,079
is Fei Ying.

555
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,319
Don’t you have any new memories?

556
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,160
You’ve known I’m Fei Ying for a long time.

557
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,040
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

558
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,359
You even tampered with Fei Ying’s wanted notice.

559
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,880
I’m telling you,

560
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,800
for you

561
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,839
and Linlang, does any of this help?
