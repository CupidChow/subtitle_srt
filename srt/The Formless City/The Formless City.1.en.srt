1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Someone's dead!

2
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,320
Someone's dead!

3
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,639
Someone's dead!

4
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,479
Since I took office,

5
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,160
I've never encountered such a major case.

6
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,600
Quick, go invite Master Xu from the Bureau of Investigation.

7
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,600
You mean

8
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,600
the top female detective of the Bureau of Investigation,

9
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,559
Master Xu Linlang?

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
Other than her,

11
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,960
who else could solve this strange case?

12
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,919
The Record of Redressing Injustice says,

13
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,160
"In prison matters, nothing is more serious than a death sentence."

14
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,119
"For a death sentence, nothing is more important than the initial investigation."

15
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,360
"And for the initial investigation, nothing is more important than the examination."

16
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,199
If even the examination hasn't been done,

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
how can we talk about solving the case?

18
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,320
The wound is shallow on the right and deep on the left.

19
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,039
Narrow on the right, wide on the left.

20
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,839
The killer is left-handed.

21
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,759
Suhexiang.

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,679
Suhexiang can relieve inflammation.

23
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,919
You have a skin condition on your neck.

24
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,279
There are calluses on your hands.

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,960
You are the killer.

26
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Linlang

27
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,199
Linlang

28
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,759
Wake up!

29
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,479
With me, Xu Linlang, the top detective of the Diancha Department, here,

30
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,880
there's no case that can't be solved.

31
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,639
What Diancha Department?

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
This is

33
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,559
Luoyang.

34
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,119
It's a long way from the capital.

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,639
You're just a lowly coroner.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,639
What are you dreaming about?

37
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,279
Then you just said there's a case.

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
You weren't dreaming, were you?

39
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,080
That part is true.

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,119
There's a corpse.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,119
Right in the main hall.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,199
As long as there's a case, that's good.

43
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,160
Solving one more case

44
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,919
means one more chance to become a top detective.

45
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,080
Make way!

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,200
The deceased

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,519
is a cow.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,959
This piece is for hotpot.

49
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
This piece is for braised beef.

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,799
In this remote place,

51
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,720
there's not even a bit of profit to be made.

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,079
Let's use this dead cow for a feast.

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,880
What grievance do you have?

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,040
I hired Zhang San to herd cattle and plow fields for my family.

55
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,679
I didn't expect him to slack off.

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,799
He was even bold enough

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,959
to poison my family's cow.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
It was poisoned to death.

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,399
We can't eat it now.

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Sir, don't worry.

61
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,040
Maybe the defendant, in order to get away, might still...

62
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,480
Zhang San

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,440
Do you know your crime?

64
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,079
I enforce the law impartially.

65
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,679
I will never let anyone suffer

66
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,320
a wrongful accusation.

67
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Your honor, please see clearly.

68
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,119
Yesterday, I secretly drank a little wine.

69
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,399
When I came back, the cow was already dead.

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,040
Your honor,

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,079
I am Li Si.

72
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,600
These days, I saw with my own eyes

73
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,799
Zhang San feeding this cow

74
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,279
some unknown things.

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:16,920
Your honor,

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,799
This was found in the cowshed.

77
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,359
There is arsenic on it.

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,679
Your honor,

79
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,679
I really didn't know there was arsenic on it.

80
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,559
Before this,

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
Li Si repeatedly urged the master to drive me away.

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I have an elderly mother and young children to support.

83
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,959
I truly can't come up with any money.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,399
I can't afford to lose this job, your honor.

85
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,959
No money.

86
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,679
Wasting my time.

87
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,679
The silver needle only turned black at the cow's neck.

88
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,640
The poison was administered after the cow died.

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,079
How dare you, Xu Linlang!

90
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,239
As a member of the yamen,

91
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,880
you dare to disturb the court.

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Your honor,

93
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,799
This cow just spoke.

94
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,839
Sir

95
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,200
This is the ox heart I just took out.

96
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,200
Although the ox is dead,

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,799
its blood still flows within its heart.

98
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,839
It retains its consciousness.

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,480
It can distinguish

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,519
who its killer is.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,600
If an ordinary person touches it, their hands will be covered in blood.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,920
Only the killer's hands will remain clean.

103
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,119
This is interesting, this is interesting.

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,519
I

105
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
recommend that the advisor also participate.

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
Yes.

107
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,040
Who is the killer?

108
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Isn't there blood on all of them?

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,679
Ah!

110
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,040
Sir.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,679
How did I become the murderer of the cow?

112
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,279
That's right.

113
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,600
Xu Linlang.

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,839
How could the advisor be the murderer of the cow?

115
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I secretly sprinkled fluorescent powder on the cow's heart just now.

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
The real culprit has a guilty conscience.

117
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,119
When being inspected,

118
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,559
they would naturally fake it and not dare to touch it.

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,880
So only the innocent

120
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,600
would have green light glowing on their hands.

121
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,119
Sir, please spare me! Sir, have mercy!

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
All three of you acted out of self-interest.

123
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,679
You framed each other.

124
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,119
None of you can escape responsibility.

125
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,239
You will be punished with flogging according to the law.

126
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,119
Sir, have mercy! Please spare us!

127
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,920
Xu Linlang.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,839
How dare you overstep your authority?

129
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
And handle the case in my place?

130
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,640
I wouldn't dare.

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
I believe you wouldn't dare.

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,760
The case is solved.

133
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,600
The three of you, for your own gain,

134
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
framed each other.

135
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,040
None of you can escape responsibility.

136
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,279
You will be punished according to the law

137
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,399
with flogging.

138
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
Young Master Lu is here.

139
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,760
Is Ling'er here?

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
Ling'er.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
I've been waiting for you.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,239
Please, come inside.

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,520
Young Master is here.

144
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,119
This is for you.

145
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,479
There's ginseng inside.

146
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,359
I had them make some for you.

147
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,119
It's to help you recover.

148
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,760
Mm.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,280
It's always like this.

150
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,520
People's hearts are hard to read.

151
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,799
You little creatures who understand people are still the cutest.

152
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,599
Now you're being modest?

153
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,479
Doggy, doggy.

154
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Doggy, doggy.

155
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,919
You all are in for a treat today.

156
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,239
Go ahead and eat.

157
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,640
I just made these today and wanted to share them with my colleagues.

158
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,719
But they all turned me down.

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,159
What,

160
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,159
even you don't want it?

161
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,599
Meat buns.

162
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you all know,

163
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,400
it's easy to go from frugality to luxury,

164
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,840
It's hard to go from luxury to frugality.

165
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
I can give you steamed buns every day.

166
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,000
But meat buns,

167
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,000
who can give you those every day?

168
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,799
Xu Linlang

169
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,000
Xu Linlang        Father

170
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,359
I've arranged a blind date for you today.

171
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,159
I knew you would do what you did the last few times,

172
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,000
stand the person up.

173
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,159
That's why I'm here to stop you.

174
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,440
Young Master Zhang,

175
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,760
comes from a scholarly family.

176
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,559
He became a successful candidate in the imperial exam at fourteen.

177
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,719
Although he's not extremely wealthy,

178
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,719
his family background is respectable.

179
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,840
Well-educated and sensible

180
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,159
And her mother passed away early

181
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,080
You won't have to deal with a difficult mother-in-law

182
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,239
Why does this matchmaking feel like a background check?

183
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,960
You're my precious daughter

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,840
How could I be careless about your marriage?

185
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
No, no

186
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,159
You need to change this outfit

187
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Let's go

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,479
Dad

189
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,840
Speaking of the top detective in the Investigation Bureau

190
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,719
Geng Zhao

191
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,559
He can handle both official duties and the underworld

192
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,719
He has influence in both legal and illegal circles

193
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,599
That day

194
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,159
Master Geng was not afraid of powerful figures

195
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,159
He swore to uncover the truth

196
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,840
But he was surrounded by dozens of attackers

197
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,200
Yet Master Geng remained calm and collected

198
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,400
He struck with a single punch

199
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,640
Using the "strike through the mountain" technique

200
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,200
The opponents fell instantly

201
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,880
In the blink of an eye

202
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,679
Master Geng leaped forward

203
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,840
He swiftly seized the crucial evidence

204
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,479
Then he used his light-footed skills

205
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,799
Gliding like a ripple on water

206
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,159
As if riding on clouds and mist

207
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,960
He vanished without a trace in an instant

208
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
As the saying goes

209
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,760
When Geng Zhao arrives, wrongful cases are solved

210
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,200
With just one official in the Investigation Bureau

211
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,719
No evil can prevail

212
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,799
Good

213
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,960
I wish I could join the Diancha Office as a constable someday.

214
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,119
You're just a woman.

215
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,520
You should stay at home, supporting your husband and raising children.

216
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,919
Even at the Diancha Office,

217
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,760
if it weren't for his father's support,

218
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,400
he probably couldn't even step out of this teahouse.

219
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,119
What's wrong with being a woman?

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,039
The Diancha Office recruits people regardless of their background.

221
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,159
As long as you're smart and capable,

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
and can solve major cases,

223
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,440
anyone can apply.

224
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,479
Besides,

225
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,919
women are naturally meticulous.

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,919
We're actually better suited for solving cases than men.

227
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
Look, everyone!

228
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,200
She's clearly just a brute of a woman.

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,200
And she dares to claim she's meticulous?

230
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,400
With your lowly status,

231
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,919
you still want to join the Diancha Office?

232
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,760
Keep dreaming.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,760
You—

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,359
My leg!

235
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,599
My leg hurts so much!

236
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,200
My leg!

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,479
My leg!

238
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,840
Go find a doctor, quickly!

239
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:28,760
No need.

240
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,679
Setting a bone is a minor thing.

241
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,520
Just leave it to me.

242
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,119
Let me take a look.

243
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,679
Are you kidding?

244
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,719
You're just a coroner.

245
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,159
And you know how to set bones?

246
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,080
Don't worry.

247
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,159
We coroners are not only skilled at examining bodies,

248
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,799
we also know how to set bones and realign joints.

249
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Thank you, craftsman.

250
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,520
How did you know I was a craftsman?

251
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,320
Your skill of striking objects from a distance

252
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,599
shows you're clearly an expert in human joints.

253
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,559
And your martial arts are impressive.

254
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,880
Plus, that abacus of yours

255
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,760
suggests you're a bodyguard, right?

256
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,599
More or less.

257
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,520
My family works as coroners, one of the Eight Trades.

258
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,359
We, the Eight Trades who roam the martial world,

259
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,799
all make a living with our skills.

260
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,080
Others may look down on us,

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,919
but we mustn't look down on ourselves.

262
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,760
Well said.

263
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,559
Oh no.

264
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,000
I almost forgot the task my father gave me.

265
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:28,840
See you.

266
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,919
Craftsman.

267
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,960
Who pays twenty coins when only ten are due?

268
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,880
How's the thing I asked you to look into?

269
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,159
The eldest son of the Lu family, Lu Mingcheng,

270
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,200
has returned.

271
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,080
Young Master Lu

272
00:14:59,159 --> 00:14:59,799
Shut up

273
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,679
The usual rules

274
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,239
Young Master Lu, you've arrived

275
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,479
It's really unfortunate, Young Master Lu

276
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,080
The private room you usually use

277
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,640
was temporarily lent out today

278
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,559
for a young gentleman and lady's matchmaking

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,599
How about

280
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,239
you take a seat in the center of the main hall

281
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,159
I'll find you the best spot

282
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
What are you saying?

283
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,479
Don't you know our young master is coming today?

284
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,400
Ah

285
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,719
I understand

286
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,599
I reckon

287
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,200
the guests in the upstairs private room

288
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,679
are probably almost done talking

289
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,239
I'll go tidy up right away

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,320
Young Master

291
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,080
Please

292
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,719
Eating too much abalone is hard to digest.

293
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,799
Even the chicken has a strong taste now.

294
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,919
This fish—

295
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,599
Are you going to let anyone eat or not?

296
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,679
Sorry, you two.

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
The rightful owner of this private room has arrived.

298
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,640
We need to clear this place.

299
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,119
Could I trouble you both,

300
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
to move to the main hall?

301
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,960
Alright, I'll leave first.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
Settle the bill first.

303
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,320
Eat.

304
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:07,960
This—

305
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
Why are you still here?

306
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,599
I can't help it either.

307
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,599
Young master—Young Master Lu.

308
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,159
Young Master Lu Jiu.

309
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,599
Distance.

310
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,840
I've long heard that Young Master Lu is impressive and dignified.

311
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,280
Now that I see you today,

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,760
Dressed in finery, naturally proud.

313
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,799
You truly are extraordinary.

314
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,119
And you call yourself a scholar.

315
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,919
Seeing you flatter the young master like this—

316
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,799
You sure change your attitude fast.

317
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,599
Young Master Lu.

318
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,039
I have nothing to do with this low-born female coroner.

319
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,640
Not the slightest connection.

320
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
Please don't misunderstand.

321
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,640
There are female coroners?

322
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,000
What's wrong with being a woman?

323
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,039
I can't stand men like you who look down on women.

324
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,919
I, Xu Linlang, am a coroner now.

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,520
In the future,

326
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,599
I'll become the top detective in the Investigation Bureau.

327
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,520
Forget it.

328
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,119
Seeing you all, I can't eat anymore.

329
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm leaving.

330
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,640
You, a top female detective? As if.

331
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Just look at that.

332
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,760
Look at this, isn't it ridiculous?

333
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,959
Who says a woman has to get married?

334
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,119
I, Xu Linlang, am going to accomplish something great.

335
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,040
If I just leave like this,

336
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,479
wouldn't that be letting them off too easily?

337
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,239
If you want to keep up with our young master,

338
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,439
you absolutely need some stamina.

339
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,079
Do you know how long I usually train?

340
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,880
At least one hour.

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
One hour.

342
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:58,880
Something terrible has happened!

343
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,839
I found a headless female corpse in the teahouse backyard.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,040
You scholars,

345
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,680
aren't you supposed to uphold justice?

346
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,719
You should solve the case.

347
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,479
The remains.

348
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,280
You're really easily frightened.

349
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,839
Looks like I have to save you myself.

350
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,040
Who smashed a big stone on my chest?

351
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,119
Could you two please settle the bill?

352
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,800
You still dare to play dead?

353
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,640
Stop pretending to be dead.

354
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:30,959
Miss,

355
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,119
Please settle the bill.

356
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,719
Why should I be the one to pay?

357
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,959
I wasn't the one who wanted this meal in the first place.

358
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,959
Make him pay.

359
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,520
Miss,

360
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,640
It's just a small business.

361
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,959
Please don't make things difficult for me.

362
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,680
Please, just one or two taels of silver.

363
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,199
This money—

364
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,959
I was saving it to take the exam for the Inspectorate.

365
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,719
I was just thinking I could save a little this month.

366
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,479
Then I could go listen to a storytelling session.

367
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,479
But now it's almost all gone.

368
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,040
It's really easy to go from frugality to extravagance,

369
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,959
but hard to go back from extravagance to frugality.

370
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,599
Do you know,

371
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,439
it's easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but hard to go back?

372
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,400
This money—

373
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:08,880
Put it on my tab.

374
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,040
Wait.

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,119
I, Xu Linlang, never take advantage of others.

376
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,359
Don't worry.

377
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,000
I have one more condition.

378
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,640
What condition?

379
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
Give me that bone.

380
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,719
Oh, so that's what you meant.

381
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,479
Otherwise,

382
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
which one did you think I meant?

383
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,680
I didn't think anything.

384
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,160
Why is this jerk talking to me like that?

385
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,400
No way, I can't let him off.

386
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,560
Right.

387
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,520
Let's do that.

388
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,359
You're paying for this meal.

389
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,680
Okay.

390
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,560
Then I won't hold back.

391
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm so full.

392
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,599
Young Master Lu,

393
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,479
I'm returning this private room to you now.

394
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,359
Goodbye.

395
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,719
Let's go.

396
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,160
Young Master Lu, Second Young Master.

397
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,280
The eldest young master is back.

398
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,959
Big brother is back.

399
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,280
Big brother!

400
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Xiao Jiu!

401
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
I missed you so much, big brother!

402
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,319
How have you been lately? Are you well?

403
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,359
Pretty good.

404
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,479
And is father well too?

405
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,000
Everything is fine.

406
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,920
Come, let's sit and talk.

407
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,800
Big brother.

408
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,400
This time you came back,

409
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,359
was it from the eastern suburbs?

410
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,319
Did you forget?

411
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
If you come back from Shuicheng,

412
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
you take the west side of the city.

413
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,640
Although I usually spoil you,

414
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,560
as your elder brother,

415
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,359
I still have a duty to offer some guidance.

416
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,680
That’s something I must do.

417
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,719
Xiao Jiu,

418
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,000
I’m all ears.

419
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,239
I’ve heard

420
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,680
that while I was away these past days,

421
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,839
you spent all your time

422
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,400
lingering around those

423
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,959
red-light districts.

424
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,439
You’re not that young anymore.

425
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,439
You should find something proper to do.

426
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,160
Big Brother,

427
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,439
people aren’t plants, we don’t all have to become something great.

428
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,800
Besides, in our Lu family,

429
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,599
having you as the outstanding one

430
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,479
is more than enough.

431
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,439
You...

432
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,280
You’re always so unambitious.

433
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,239
I don’t even know what to say about you.

434
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Father

435
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,319
He has lived in Water City for a long time.

436
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,319
During holidays and festivals,

437
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,119
even when I want to visit, he won't let me see him.

438
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,040
I wonder if it's because

439
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,319
he still resents me for running away from home as a child,

440
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,760
making the whole family worry.

441
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,239
Is he still angry about that?

442
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
How could that be?

443
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,520
You were so young back then,

444
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,239
and seriously ill with a fever.

445
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,760
You wandered outside for so long,

446
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,920
but returned home safely.

447
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,439
That was already a blessing from above.

448
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,959
Why would Father blame you?

449
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,400
But for so many years,

450
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,400
Father has always avoided seeing me.

451
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,359
It seems

452
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,119
he is still angry.

453
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,160
Father's deep foresight

454
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,000
is not something you or I can guess.

455
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,920
This hairpin

456
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,880
is crafted so delicately.

457
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,319
I hope

458
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,239
he will like it.

459
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,479
With such craftsmanship,

460
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,119
it's not from the palace, is it?

461
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Do you want to be the most dazzling on the pleasure boat?

462
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,839
Let me see who wants to be the most dazzling on the pleasure boat.

463
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,959
These pieces of jewelry

464
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,400
were all made by you?

465
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,479
Yes, I did.

466
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,560
Sister Courtesan,

467
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,000
they are much more exquisite than those on the market.

468
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,319
In a few days,

469
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,359
I will marry the eldest son of the Lu family.

470
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,920
I'm in need of some jewelry.

471
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,479
Pack up and come with me.

472
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,640
Why would big brother bring me to this place?

473
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,680
Haven't you been here quite a few times already?

474
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,400
But big brother said we were coming to see sister-in-law.

475
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,680
Your sister-in-law is no ordinary person.

476
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,880
She's been waiting for you for a long time.

477
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,640
Xiao Jiu, greet your sister-in-law.

478
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,760
Oh, right.

479
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm still missing some jewelry for my wedding outfit.

480
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,040
I met this craftsman today.

481
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,560
The jewelry he makes actually looks quite nice.

482
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,719
It's just that

483
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,199
the price is a bit high.

484
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,199
As long as you like it,

485
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,800
I'll buy it for you no matter how expensive it is.

486
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:18,920
Tomorrow,

487
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,319
pick out the finest designs.

488
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,280
Don't worry about the price.

489
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,719
Have them delivered directly to the Lu residence.

490
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,439
Let Lingling choose carefully.

491
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,479
You're always the best to me.

492
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
But

493
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,000
Even though I am the courtesan queen,

494
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,479
I am about to get married soon.

495
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,239
Sooner or later, I'll be outshined by the newcomers.

496
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,760
Who is it?

497
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,560
What a coincidence.

498
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,280
My name is Wan Lingling.

499
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,920
Her name is Ling'er.

500
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,239
She even said

501
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,199
she wants to be the most beautiful in the pleasure boat.

502
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,199
Anyone who dares to upset me, Lingling,

503
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,040
Someone, come!

504
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,439
Let the madam

505
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,680
give her a good lesson.

506
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,479
Stop!

507
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,359
Big brother,

508
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
Ling'er is the girl I am with.

509
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,599
For my sake, if not for hers,

510
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
please let her go.

511
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,400
I am the future matron of the Lu family.

512
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
She is just a songstress.

513
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,280
How dare you compare me to her?

514
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,839
Then I'll buy her freedom.

515
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,520
You—

516
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,640
Enough, enough.

517
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,839
We're all family here.

518
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,640
Don't let outsiders laugh at us.

519
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,439
Alright, that's enough.

520
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,319
Dad

521
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,439
Dad

522
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,160
It's all my fault

523
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,920
I swear

524
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,359
I won't cause trouble again in the future

525
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,599
It's all my fault as your father

526
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,119
I mistakenly took that scholar Zhang

527
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,520
for a good man

528
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,800
and almost pushed you into a pit of fire

529
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,560
Dad

530
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,119
So you're not angry anymore?

531
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,040
Why would I still be angry?

532
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,040
Our family are coroners.

533
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,640
Others all think we're unlucky.

534
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,160
Today's matchmaking,

535
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,199
Father, you must have begged a lot of people, right?

536
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,160
As long as you can marry into a good family,

537
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm willing to do anything.

538
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,239
Then I won't get married.

539
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,760
How about just relying on each other, you and me?

540
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,560
If I don't get married,

541
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I can live my life the way I want.

542
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,880
Let's travel the world together.

543
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,439
Uphold justice and solve cases for the wronged.

544
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,880
The world is full of dangers.

545
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,839
It's not as wonderful as you imagine.

546
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,719
Then how do you know, Father?

547
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Well...

548
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,839
If you can go listen to storytellers,

549
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,239
why can't I go too?

550
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,040
I ask for nothing else,

551
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,280
just that you can find a good family to marry into.

552
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,920
and live a good life, Linlang.

553
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,000
Linlang, Linlang!

554
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,079
There's been a murder!

555
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,400
This time,

556
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
it's really a murder case.

557
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,119
Bring the kit and come with me.

558
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,959
Hurry up!

559
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:12,599
Father!

560
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,520
What did I just say?

561
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,599
Just wait and see.

562
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,520
I don't even know if letting her learn this trade

563
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,479
has actually harmed her.

564
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,640
Sir, sir!

565
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,959
Something has happened!

566
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,880
With me here, what could possibly go wrong?

567
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,239
Someone has died!

568
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,439
How did you get here so quickly? — Yes, indeed.

569
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,319
I didn't expect things to go so smoothly today either.

570
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:43,920
Sir.

571
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,359
Oh.

572
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,640
Sir was conducting a discreet inspection nearby today.

573
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,719
Upon hearing something happened here,

574
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,000
he rushed over immediately.

575
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,400
That's right.

576
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,719
What's the situation now?

577
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Reporting to you, sir,

578
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,359
a songstress was found in her own room

579
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,280
dead.

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
Most likely, some guest drove her to her death.

581
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,719
Since we're here, let's go take a look.

582
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,000
Yes, please.

583
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:15,920
Sir

584
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,520
What happened?

585
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,959
There are no fatal external injuries.

586
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,920
But her mouth and nose are darkened.

587
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,119
She was probably poisoned.

588
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,520
But what kind of poison was it?

589
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Sir, please have everyone who came into contact with Ling'er

590
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
brought back for questioning.

591
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:32,079
I don't need your advice to handle this case.

592
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,800
Head Constable Zhao

593
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes

594
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Take everyone present back to the county office.

595
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:36,800
Understood

596
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,079
Sir

597
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:43,920
Sir

598
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,520
If you do this

599
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,560
how are we supposed to do business?

600
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
You dare to point fingers at me too?

601
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,800
No, no, no

602
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,079
Actually

603
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,040
Actually, I know who the murderer is.

604
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
Today, a young gentleman

605
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,400
redeemed Ling'er.

606
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,000
Before she died, Ling'er drank the ginseng soup he brought.

607
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,079
Then a servant saw the two of them arguing.

608
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,439
And then Ling'er

609
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,119
died.

610
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,040
Where is this person now?

611
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,000
Over there

612
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,560
It's him

613
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,880
Young Master Lu Jiu

614
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,920
I have a good relationship with your elder brother, Lu Mingcheng.

615
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,560
We are quite well acquainted.

616
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,479
The county office has been in disrepair for years.

617
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,280
Last time, your brother paid for the renovations.

618
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,520
You must pass on my regards

619
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,199
to your brother for me—Sir

620
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,239
Please restrain yourself in front of so many people.

621
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,239
Restrain yourself.

622
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:48,239
Today

623
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,760
It's already late

624
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,400
I am considerate of the people's situation

625
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,160
All those involved in this case

626
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,880
will be registered and questioned again tomorrow

627
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:56,719
Questioned again tomorrow

628
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,959
No, he has power and influence

629
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
If you let him wait until tomorrow

630
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,880
I'm afraid you'll give him a chance to manipulate things

631
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:02,520
Sir

632
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,560
If you take him back now

633
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,439
and question him today

634
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,439
You

635
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,400
In a few days

636
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,119
it will be my brother's wedding day

637
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,640
I don't want to cause him trouble

638
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,520
I didn't kill anyone

639
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,560
I'm not going to run away

640
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,160
If it's found to be related to me

641
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,800
then at that time

642
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,800
it won't be too late to arrest me

643
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,959
That's reasonable and humane

644
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,920
Mr. Lu, do as you wish

645
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,040
Do as you wish

646
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,400
You're not allowed to leave
