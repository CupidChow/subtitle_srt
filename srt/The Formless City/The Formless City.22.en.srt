1
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,559
That rascal Lu Jiu

2
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,199
He

3
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,400
He actually

4
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,000
is really going to

5
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,440
marry that demoness

6
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,119
Linlang

7
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,839
Don’t scare your uncle

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,399
It’s just a man

9
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,960
Later

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I’ll find you someone even better

11
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,399
Uncle is right

12
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,080
By the way

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,360
About settling the former members of Fenglei Hall

14
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,880
I haven’t checked on it yet

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,080
I’ll go first

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,639
In this lifetime

17
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
meeting you

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,639
is the luckiest thing that ever happened to me

19
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
Come out.

20
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,720
I know you haven't gone far.

21
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,679
Hurry up.

22
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,839
Raise the left side a bit.

23
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,759
No, that's not right.

24
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,839
Raise the right side a bit more.

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
The guests will arrive soon.

26
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,479
How can you not even handle this simple task?

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,679
Move faster.

28
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,600
Higher, higher.

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,839
That's too high.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
Come over here.

31
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,839
A bit higher, a bit higher.

32
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,639
Raise the left side by an inch.

33
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,440
No.

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,559
You raised it by two inches.

35
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,360
Young Master Sima.

36
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,960
Can you not be so particular?

37
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,800
No.

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,839
Linlang's wedding

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,440
must be taken even more seriously than usual.

40
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,640
The right side.

41
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,480
Why are you here?

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
My younger brother is getting married.

43
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,600
As the elder brother,

44
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,200
how could I not be present?

45
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,279
Don't forget,

46
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,600
on the day I got married,

47
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,359
I even prepared a big gift for you.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
I almost forgot.

49
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,559
Your memories of Lu Jiu

50
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,880
you've forgotten them all.

51
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,440
What exactly did you do to me?

52
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,440
No matter what I did to you,

53
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,040
the eldest brother is like a father.

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,519
Later,

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,959
you still have to follow the rules

56
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,399
and bow to me as you would to a parent.

57
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,720
This is your fate.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,440
Hurry up!

59
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,760
Hey, lift the left side a bit higher.

60
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,320
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

61
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,760
Fei Ying.

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,440
Second bow to the elders.

63
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,440
It seems

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,279
my words still carry little weight.

65
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,239
Fei Ying.

66
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,119
doesn't show respect for me as the elder brother.

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
After all, today is Miss Dugu's most important day.

68
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,359
Then I will

69
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,679
sit down.

70
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,079
With me here,

71
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,480
he wouldn't dare refuse to bow to you.

72
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,000
The envoy from Tang Sect has arrived.

73
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,679
Sima Kong from the Tang Sect

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,559
I have come to present a congratulatory gift on behalf of my master.

75
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,519
So you are Sima Kong.

76
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,640
A wise man adapts to the times.

77
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,720
No wonder Lord Tang protects you so much.

78
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,239
Earlier, my subordinate nearly took your life.

79
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,679
He even came to question me about it.

80
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,559
To be able to contribute to Tianluo

81
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,320
is a small matter for me,

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,839
but a blessing for the Tang Sect.

83
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,239
Envoy, please wait a moment.

84
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
The ceremony is not yet over.

85
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,119
Our gift

86
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,959
must be given before the ceremony ends.

87
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
That is what makes it meaningful.

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
What exactly are you trying to do?

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Don't worry.

90
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm not foolish enough to use hidden weapons in the Tianluo Hall.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,799
I'm giving you this notebook.

92
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,640
Write down the most important things you want to remember.

93
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,920
Record them all in here.

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,839
That way, you won't forget.

95
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,519
So you can remember what matters most to you.

96
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,160
Why are you drawing me?

97
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,280
Because

98
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,080
the one thing I must never forget

99
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,679
is you.

100
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't leave.

101
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,520
I saved some food for you.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,799
There aren't any candied hawthorns here.

103
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,960
I found all of this in Li Mu's medicine box.

104
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,599
Just with this,

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,080
You said this was the most important scene for you.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
I believe that in the future,

107
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,119
we will have many more wonderful memories.

108
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,000
My drawing.

109
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,239
Lu Jiu.

110
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,559
Linlang.

111
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
Linlang.

112
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,960
You finally remembered me.

113
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,039
Luo Linlang

114
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,960
Today is my wedding day.

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,919
Why do you keep haunting me?

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,239
Linlang, are you alright?

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm fine.

118
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,679
Guards!

119
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Arrest them!

120
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm glad you didn't give up on me.

121
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,840
I told you, I'm a businessman.

122
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,239
Since I've lost my beloved,

123
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,280
saving a brother isn't so bad either.

124
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,679
How did you know what Sima Kong feels about me?

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,840
You're the only one who doesn't know.

126
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,559
Watch out!

127
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,559
Lord Dugu

128
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,159
I told you long ago, this ungrateful wolf can't be trusted.

129
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,159
He was bound to betray us.

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,719
Setting a trap with the wedding

131
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,719
was sure to lure Luo Linlang here.

132
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
So it was all your plan.

133
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,559
Fei Ying

134
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,640
You've really disappointed me.

135
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,520
After I treated you like my own child,

136
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,520
taught you martial arts,

137
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,599
and even promised you my daughter.

138
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
Senior Sister has indeed been very good to me.

139
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,359
But you...

140
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,119
If you truly cared for her,

141
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,919
you wouldn't have used her wedding as a trap.

142
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,719
We're nothing but pawns to you.

143
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,320
So what if you're pawns?

144
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,719
At least I can still use you.

145
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,119
Now that you can't remember the secret of the treasure,

146
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
and you harbor thoughts of betrayal,

147
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,919
what use are you to me?

148
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,520
Except for this girl,

149
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,799
kill all the others.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
Even if you act as Tang Luo's lackey today,

151
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,960
and get some benefits in return,

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,919
once you're no longer useful to him,

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
you'll still be kicked aside.

154
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,840
My big brother,

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,799
that's still better than being a dead man.

156
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,440
Useless.

157
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,559
Just like your father,

158
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,719
you can't even be a good dog.

159
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,640
Hurry, go!

160
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,640
Don't forget.

161
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,359
I taught you your martial arts.

162
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,400
Lu Jiu.

163
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,359
Lin Lang.

164
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,320
Lu Jiu.

165
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,760
I once taught you

166
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,440
that sentiment is the most useless thing in the world.

167
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,840
I was able to become the leader of Tianluo

168
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
because

169
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
I always kept a backup plan for everyone

170
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,239
I always kept a backup plan for everyone.

171
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,520
Including you.

172
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,239
You look down on sentiment,

173
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,719
but in fact,

174
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,640
the most precious thing in this world

175
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
is sentiment.

176
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,640
Guards!

177
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,799
Take him away.

178
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,400
This...

179
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,039
Tianluo is such a dangerous place,

180
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,599
how could Sima Kong not discuss with us

181
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,119
before taking Lin Lang there?

182
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,440
Now Lin Lang is being held by Tianluo,

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,799
and he himself is too ashamed to return.

184
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,000
He's disappeared without a trace.

185
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,640
How are we supposed to rescue her?

186
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,479
Doctor Xu,

187
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm afraid what you said isn't quite fair.

188
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,760
You know the hall master's temper.

189
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
No one can stop her from doing what she wants.

190
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Young Master Sima must have had no choice.

191
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,359
Whose side are you on, anyway?

192
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,440
How can you speak up for that Tang Clan kid?

193
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,320
Enough, stop arguing.

194
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,239
The urgent thing now is to go to the capital and rescue her.

195
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,159
Outside of Gushan, all the land belongs to the imperial court.

196
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,799
Everyone from Fenglei Hall is accused of treason.

197
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm afraid they won't even get close to the capital before...

198
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Actually, what worries me more is...

199
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,440
Dugu

200
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:07,039
He will definitely use the feelings between Lu Jiu and Linlang.

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,239
To restrain and threaten each other.

202
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,640
Forcing Linlang

203
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,760
to reveal the treasure's password.

204
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,919
We meet again so soon.

205
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,799
He risked his life to save you, and his fate is still unknown.

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
Yet you can still smile.

207
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
Your target is me.

208
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,599
I know with you protecting him,

209
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,919
he'll be fine.

210
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,960
You two made me lose face in public.

211
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,359
I was ridiculed by everyone.

212
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,520
Why should I still protect him?

213
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,440
We are the ones who owe you for this.

214
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,799
But my feelings for Lu Jiu

215
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,200
are just like your feelings for Fei Ying.

216
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,080
I can't let go.

217
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,559
Don't mention Fei Ying to me.

218
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,960
You're the one who changed him into someone else.

219
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,799
Even if I can't keep his heart,

220
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,719
I won't just give him to you.

221
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,520
Liking someone is possessive.

222
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,359
You want them to reciprocate.

223
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,359
But loving someone is about letting them go.

224
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,559
As long as they're happy, that's enough.

225
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Lu Jiu and I

226
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
have both, for each other,

227
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,320
given up what mattered most.

228
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,119
Don't lecture me about how to love.

229
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,359
You're so self-righteous.

230
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,200
Do you know that right now, for you,

231
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
he's about to lose his life?

232
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,880
What?

233
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,320
I advise you not to put up a pointless fight.

234
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,000
As long as you let Luo Linlang

235
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,840
hand over the clue to the treasure,

236
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,239
I will let both of you go.

237
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,440
I've been by your side for over ten years.

238
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,840
I know your character better than anyone.

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,599
If you let us go,

240
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm afraid that once you get the clue,

241
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,119
it will be the day Linlang and I die.

242
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,119
I want to see

243
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,599
after seven years apart,

244
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,239
whether Tian Luo's

245
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,599
interrogation methods

246
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,799
have improved at all.

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,440
My disciple,

248
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,119
it seems you really don't understand me.

249
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:46,880
Father

250
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,520
Luo Linlang has already handed over the clue.

251
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,760
Please stop the torture.

252
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,159
For your sake,

253
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,719
I'll give him one more chance.

254
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,239
Thank you, Father.

255
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,160
Go away.

256
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,719
Fei Ying

257
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,439
Fei Ying

258
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,959
Fei Ying

259
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,520
Wake up, Fei Ying.

260
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,400
Fei Ying

261
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,199
Lu Jiu

262
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,560
How are you?

263
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,680
Does it hurt?

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm fine.

265
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,079
I mean,

266
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,839
how could you so easily

267
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
give away the hairpin

268
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,119
just like that?

269
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,119
Is there anything

270
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,199
more important than you?

271
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,959
Why are you so foolish?

272
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
With that hairpin in our hands,

273
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,239
we

274
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,000
still have leverage for negotiation.

275
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,400
Now,

276
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,959
I'm afraid

277
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,439
we really can't get out.

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,839
You used to be one of Tianluo, after all.

279
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,400
How could they treat you like this?

280
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,400
Tianluo...

281
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,400
There’s no real camaraderie there.

282
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,319
Before,

283
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,839
I was Tianluo’s top assassin.

284
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
Now, they’re just

285
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,199
going along with the flow.

286
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,839
Kicking me when I’m down.

287
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,319
But I can tell

288
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,959
Miss Yemei truly cares about you.

289
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,319
Senior Sister

290
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,079
has indeed been very good to me.

291
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
But

292
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,520
from beginning to end,

293
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,119
my feelings for her

294
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,439
are only gratitude.

295
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
You fool.

296
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,280
After all we’ve been through,

297
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,880
how could I ever doubt you?

298
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,199
I have Yemei.

299
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
Don’t you have Sima Kong?

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,319
That makes us even.

301
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
How could Sima Kong and I compare to you two?

302
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,000
From start to finish,

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,199
I knew nothing.

304
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
It was only a few days ago

305
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,560
that I found out.

306
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,319
Our little Langlang

307
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,199
is so cute,

308
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,839
and so beautiful.

309
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,400
Thinking about it,

310
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,319
all the men in the world

311
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,880
must like you.

312
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,400
You’re still so glib even now.

313
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,439
Lu Jiu

314
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,479
There's something

315
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,439
I want you to answer me seriously

316
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,079
Go ahead

317
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,439
Sima Kong said he likes me

318
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,319
because his childhood was full of suffering

319
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,920
and he feels the warmth of home in me

320
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,359
Your childhood was like that too

321
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,160
Is that why you like me as well?

322
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,079
If I said

323
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,920
I even

324
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't even know

325
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,439
when I started liking you

326
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,560
would you believe me?

327
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,839
Maybe

328
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,920
it was when we faced danger

329
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Or maybe

330
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
it was even earlier

331
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,119
when you two teamed up to trick me

332
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,839
No matter what

333
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,119
what I'm sure of is

334
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,400
I like you

335
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,719
Whoever obtains the Wuxiang Treasure will rule the world.

336
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,239
But not everyone can bear that responsibility.

337
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
I, Dugu Wumo,

338
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,079
have been beneath others for so many years.

339
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,160
This game of chess

340
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,359
should come to an end.

341
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
Congratulations, my lord! Congratulations!

342
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,599
As long as we decipher the code in this hairpin,

343
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,199
the Wuxiang Treasure

344
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,199
and even the fate of the entire nation

345
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,239
will be within your grasp, my lord.

346
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,400
Rest assured,

347
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,719
I won't forget your contributions.

348
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,239
The salt and grain transport businesses

349
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,680
are yours to choose from.

350
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,959
I, your humble servant,

351
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,640
once heard my father say

352
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,199
that your promise back then

353
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,760
was actually a princely title.

354
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,479
A dog

355
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,400
has no right to bargain with its master.

356
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,359
Your father forgot that.

357
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,040
He wanted too much.

358
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
In the end, he brought disaster upon himself.

359
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,359
That's why I

360
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,359
helped you, my lord,

361
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,000
to get rid of that old man.

362
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,920
Your father

363
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,640
may have been short-sighted,

364
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,439
but he was a good judge of character.

365
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
He said you

366
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,880
are ruthless enough,

367
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,560
but lack true ability.

368
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,959
He was absolutely right.

369
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,000
As long as I can be of use to you,

370
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,280
I will give my utmost effort.

371
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,959
Does that mean I can dare to dream of a princely title?

372
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,000
A wandering outlaw

373
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,280
suddenly became a wealthy merchant.

374
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,199
That is already a great favor.

375
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,920
If you go any higher,

376
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,839
I’ll let you take my position as the leader of Tianluo.

377
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I wouldn’t dare.

378
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,239
I chose you back then

379
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,719
because you’re much smarter than your father.

380
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,000
If you have any more improper thoughts,

381
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,040
don’t blame me for putting you back in your place.

382
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,319
Stay obediently by my side

383
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,199
and be my loyal dog.

384
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,920
Thank you for your guidance, sir.

385
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,560
I will do my utmost

386
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
to assist you in accomplishing your great cause.

387
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,239
Reporting to the city lord,

388
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,839
there’s suddenly a fire in the prison.

389
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,160
They don’t even bother to change their rescue tricks.

390
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,280
Order men to guard the prison entrance.

391
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,479
Catch them like turtles in a jar.

392
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,239
Yes, sir.

393
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,560
A fire?

394
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,839
Is Sima Kong here to rescue us?

395
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,199
Probably not.

396
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,560
Then who is it?

397
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,199
Lu Jiu.

398
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,719
He let you escape once in Luoyang.

399
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,160
You’re seriously injured now.

400
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,560
Can you still fight us?

401
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,239
What about them?

402
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,160
Hand them over

403
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,400
to Tianluo.

404
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,439
Maybe

405
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,880
there are more surprises waiting.

406
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,599
Hmm.

407
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,160
Let’s go.

408
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,199
My big brother really treats me well.

409
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,599
This favor came at just the right time.

410
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,520
I’ll gladly accept it.

411
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Let’s go.

412
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,640
Linlang

413
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,479
I'll pull you up.

414
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,479
What about you?

415
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,680
Me...

416
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,959
My injuries are too severe.

417
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,119
This wall is too high.

418
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,000
I can't go with you anymore.

419
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,719
Go.

420
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,839
You liar.

421
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
Outside Gushan City, you said

422
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,239
you would be with me forever.

423
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,839
But first you married someone else.

424
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,199
And now you're making me leave alone.

425
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,160
I don't care.

426
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,760
If you don't go, I won't go either.

427
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,160
You women

428
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,280
always get emotional at critical moments.

429
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,160
Go.

430
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,000
Who's being emotional?

431
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,319
It's clearly you men

432
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,920
who always blame everything on women.

433
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,800
Are you done arguing?

434
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,239
If you're done, how about we keep running for our lives?

435
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,439
It seems

436
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,560
I owe you another favor.

437
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,959
What you owe me

438
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,560
is more than just this time.

439
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,760
My young master

440
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,920
already knew that Luming City wouldn't let this go.

441
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,920
So he ordered me to secretly keep watch.

442
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,719
Sima, the grand strategist, truly lives up to his name.

443
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,760
He calculated everything,

444
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,439
but didn't expect this to happen.

445
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,719
Senior Sister

446
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:26,760
I...

447
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
You don't need to say anything.

448
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,040
Since the day of the Lantern Festival,

449
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,599
I knew then that I wasn't in your heart.

450
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,319
I still stand by what I said.

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,119
All the kindness you've shown me,

452
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,119
I've seen it all.

453
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,400
In Tianluo, you are my only family.

454
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,520
Lu Jiu,

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,280
In your eyes,

456
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
am I really just family to you?

457
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,199
As you can see,

458
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,839
in my heart,

459
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,719
there is only Luo Linlang.

460
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,479
You should go.

461
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,839
Those who don't belong to me

462
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,839
there's no point in them staying.

463
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,839
Want to leave?

464
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,319
It's not that easy.

465
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,800
Everything is connected.

466
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
Will this ever end?

467
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,760
Father.

468
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,640
Your daughter has never asked you for anything.

469
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,400
Please let Fei Ying go.

470
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,239
Such feminine compassion.

471
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,839
How can you be my daughter, Du Gu Wu Wo's daughter, with such weakness?

472
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,520
Father.

473
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,439
Say no more.

474
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,239
He doesn't care about the kindness I showed raising him.

475
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,719
And he has betrayed your feelings even more.

476
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,839
I will never let him go.

477
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
If you want to kill Fei Ying,

478
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,680
then you'll have to step over your daughter's corpse first.

479
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,560
Senior sister.

480
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
You don't need to worry about me.

481
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,520
Let me be with him.

482
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,599
Let us settle all these debts and grudges

483
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,800
once and for all.

484
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
Do you see now?

485
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,280
All your devotion to him was for nothing.

486
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
He doesn't care at all.

487
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,839
Father.

488
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
What you want is the Wuxiang treasure.

489
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,239
You already have it now.

490
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,000
Why do you still have to kill them?

491
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,439
What I hate most

492
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,439
is those who betray me.

493
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,920
Including you.

494
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,839
But in the end, you are my blood.

495
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,640
So I'll give you one more chance.

496
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,119
Go kill Fei Ying.

497
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,119
Then you will still be my daughter.

498
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,520
And the heir to Wuxiang City.

499
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,319
Lu Jiu        Lu Jiu

500
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,719
You all, go quickly!

501
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,920
Senior Sister!

502
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,640
Don't worry.

503
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,439
My father won't do anything to me.

504
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,479
Go, now!

505
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,839
Go!

506
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,199
I no longer have this daughter.

507
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,400
Obey the order!

508
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,479
Kill without mercy!
