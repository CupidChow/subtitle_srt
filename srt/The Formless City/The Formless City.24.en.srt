1
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
Young Master

2
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,080
Luo Linlang and the others have returned.

3
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,399
Should we continue the attack?

4
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,320
Since they've come back,

5
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,119
it means they still haven't figured out

6
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,679
the key to the Wuxiang treasure.

7
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,279
Let's wait until they get closer to the treasure,

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,839
then it's not too late to make a move.

9
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,960
Yes.

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
That old man

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,039
has failed here twice.

12
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,759
I will never let the Wuxiang treasure

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,360
slip through my fingers again.

14
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,279
Please, Master Tang, give us your guidance.

15
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,759
We only know that Wuxiang City is related to dragons,

16
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,800
but we don't know exactly where.

17
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,600
If there are dragon sculptures or totems in the city,

18
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,720
they must be connected to the royal family.

19
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,839
And most of them were made by the Tang clan.

20
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,720
But records on this topic

21
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,800
number at least several thousand.

22
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,479
They're right here.

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,199
Luoyang County

24
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,360
I've grown up here since I was a child.

25
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,720
I've never heard of the Wuxiang treasure.

26
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,399
Nor have I heard of anything related to dragons.

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,559
Dragons

28
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
are symbols of the emperor.

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,199
In ordinary places,

30
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,520
who would dare to use the dragon symbol so casually?

31
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,520
But in ancient times, there was a saying

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,639
that "the pig has the appearance of a dragon."

33
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,720
The mountains surrounding Luoyang County

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
and its terrain

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,279
form the shape of a pig.

36
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,559
Moreover,

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,240
this Luoyang County

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
is actually Fenglei Hall,

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
the hometown of Master Luo Feng.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,919
But when Master asked me to investigate the Wuxiang Treasure,

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,960
I looked into Master Luo's background,

42
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,399
and it had nothing to do with Luoyang County.

43
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,320
Hmm.

44
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,520
I only found out about this recently as well.

45
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,000
By then, you had already sided with someone else.

46
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,240
So I deliberately didn't tell you.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,679
You and your master,

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,559
from this perspective, actually seem like

49
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,880
an ordinary father and son.

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,239
This Luoyang County

51
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,920
used to be the residence of the Luo clan.

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,720
For generations,

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,160
they have quietly protected the Wuxiang Treasure.

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
Later,

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,519
medicine declined.

56
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Only the Luofeng lineage remained steadfast.

57
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,920
This Luofeng,

58
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,720
not only possesses remarkable medical skills,

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,119
but also

60
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,200
has a heart to help the world.

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,920
But later,

62
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,399
Fenglei Hall became overly famous.

63
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,880
The secret of the Wuxiang Treasure

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,559
was also discovered by outsiders.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,119
So Master Luo concealed his homeland

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,519
to protect the Wuxiang Treasure.

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
So my father raised me in Luoyang County

68
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,640
with such deep intentions.

69
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,839
That's right.

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
I suppose Lu Kun

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,000
had been lurking by Master Luo's side for a long time

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,799
and must have noticed something.

73
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,559
So while investigating clues in Wu Town,

74
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
he arranged for Luming City

75
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,239
to be stationed in Luoyang County.

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,600
Then let's return to Luoyang County immediately.

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,359
We must get there before Luming City does

78
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,559
and obtain the Wuxiang Treasure.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,239
Mm.

80
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:27,200
Mm.

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Mm.

82
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,920
Giddy up!

83
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,480
Giddy up!

84
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,279
Giddy up!

85
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,079
Giddy up!

86
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,279
Giddy up!

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,880
Giddy up!

88
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,399
Keep a close eye on them.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,440
Yes, yes.

90
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,920
Although Lord Geng Zhao said

91
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,480
my warrant is fake,

92
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,559
but

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,480
the charges against me are real.

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,920
Walking so openly on the streets of Luoyang County

95
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,320
isn't it a bit inappropriate?

96
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,079
Business is good, boss.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,399
Give two oranges to pay respects to the county magistrate.

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,799
Speak of the devil.

99
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,880
Advisor!

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,359
My eyes aren't playing tricks on me, right?

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
No, no, no, you're seeing right.

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
It's Lu Jiu and his group.

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,640
So we

104
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,359
arrest them?

105
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,720
Geng Zhao said to let them go.

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,279
Lu Mingcheng said to arrest them.

107
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,959
Although those two are nowhere to be seen right now,

108
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,760
but

109
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,440
if your indecisiveness

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,720
is discovered,

111
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm afraid

112
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,399
What's going on?

113
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,040
Then run! Run!

114
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Could it be

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,799
he was intimidated by my reputation as Tianluo's top assassin

116
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,720
and got scared?

117
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,480
Do you still remember that teahouse?

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
The place where we first met.

119
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,279
That day, I was on a blind date.

120
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,040
You suddenly barged in for no reason.

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,119
I even pretended a pork bone was a human bone to scare you.

122
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,679
With my courage as Tianluo's top assassin,

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,519
how did I get scared by you so easily?

124
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,119
So, in that case,

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
my first meeting with Linlang

126
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,559
was even earlier than yours.

127
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,239
Stop trying to make yourself look good.

128
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,920
I knew her way before you did.

129
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,200
When was that?

130
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,440
Here,

131
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,799
do you remember

132
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,440
when I fed the dog with meat buns?

133
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,839
You even scolded me for it.

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,320
You said I was spoiling the dog.

135
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,440
It's easy to go from frugality to luxury,

136
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,399
but hard to go from luxury to frugality.

137
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,119
So that person was you!

138
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,720
So,

139
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,399
the connection between us

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,399
is even deeper than we thought.

141
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,079
Alright, alright.

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,920
Everyone knows you two have a special bond.

143
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,760
Yeah.

144
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:07,839
Don't forget

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,519
the real reason we came to Luoyang County.

146
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Let's go.

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,000
I searched every shop in Luoyang County.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,920
On all the small statues,

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
there wasn't a single clue.

150
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,359
Could it be that we're looking in the wrong place?

151
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,519
So you're saying,

152
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,520
maybe the clue

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
isn't hidden in the small statues.

154
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,599
Then why are there images of Guanyin in the jewelry box?

155
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,880
And Manjusri, Puxian, Ksitigarbha,

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,159
as well as images of Maitreya?

157
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,559
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

158
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,799
This is extortion.

159
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,719
Move aside.

160
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,520
Move aside.

161
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Please, don't get upset.

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,479
What I ordered was the Dragon, Tiger, and Phoenix Feast.

163
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
But you served me a roast chicken.

164
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Why is this annoying person here again?

165
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,039
Isn't that just deliberately deceiving people?

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,960
Get up.

167
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,520
Step aside.

168
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,559
Why report to the authorities? Let me tell you—

169
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,599
Listen—

170
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Actually, I met you through him.

171
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,000
So, in a way, he's half a matchmaker.

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,599
You dare to cheat me?

173
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,200
Sir,

174
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,599
You're so knowledgeable.

175
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

176
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,760
For example, using Dukang to refer to wine—it's a metaphor.

177
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Let go of me.

178
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,239
Or using the fire god Zhurong to represent fire.

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
When you order the Dragon, Tiger, and Phoenix Feast,

180
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,880
do you really expect to eat dragon or phoenix meat?

181
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,320
If it's not the little elephant,

182
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,599
then it should be something related to it.

183
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,599
The verse mentions five great companions.

184
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,679
Could it be their mounts?

185
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,320
Guanyin's mount is the golden-haired Hou.

186
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,760
Manjusri's mount is the blue lion.

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,280
Puxian's mount is the six-tusked white elephant.

188
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,880
Ksitigarbha's mount is the Di Ting.

189
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,359
Maitreya's mount is the peacock.

190
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,080
That's exactly five.

191
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:58,919
Right.

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
It's five.

193
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,039
That's correct.

194
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,039
No, that's not right.

195
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,239
Four.

196
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,080
Four.

197
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,080
Mm-hmm.

198
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:07,919
But in the verse,

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,640
it clearly mentions five main followers.

200
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,840
That's to mislead those who covet the treasure.

201
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,760
Do you still remember

202
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,679
the nine-layered fragrant silk and the medicine men?

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
My father developed those.

204
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,559
Of course I remember.

205
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,640
The nine-layered fragrant silk can preserve the medicine men's bodies from decay.

206
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,039
Medicine men are similar to zombies.

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,239
That's right.

208
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,679
Guanyin's mount, the Golden-haired Hou,

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,159
is actually a zombie whose body doesn't decay.

210
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,159
A zombie.

211
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,119
I remember

212
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
According to legend

213
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,840
when a zombie is born

214
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,239
it has white hair on its tendons

215
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,719
after five hundred years of cultivation

216
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,000
the white hair turns black

217
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,119
after another five hundred years

218
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,679
the black hair turns yellow

219
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,080
finally, it becomes golden hair

220
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,119
All zombies

221
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,960
will be destroyed by heavenly thunder

222
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
only one golden-haired zombie can survive

223
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
that is the Golden Haired Hou

224
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,000
So, in that case

225
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,000
the Golden Haired Hou

226
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,320
is the one that replaces the Luo family in guarding the Wuxiang treasure

227
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,239
That's right

228
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Actually, the real clue

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,679
is the green lion, white elephant, Di Ting

230
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,359
and the peacock, these four mounts

231
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,080
Makes sense

232
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,479
I've read the records left by Master Luo

233
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,239
the medical cases and Wind and Thunder Hall files

234
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,440
All the classifications

235
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
are multiples of four

236
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,039
Warm, hot, cold, cool—the four natures

237
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Looking, listening, questioning, feeling—the four diagnoses

238
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,760
Huangdi Neijing

239
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,599
Nanjing

240
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,760
Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Diseases

241
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
Shennong Bencao Jing

242
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,039
The Four Great Classical Novels—always four

243
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,239
Those coveting the treasure probably haven't realized this yet

244
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,640
Let's go

245
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
We'll split up

246
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,320
Since

247
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,000
it's something from the era when the treasure was buried

248
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,000
then surely

249
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,159
it must be something quite old

250
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,559
I found Manjusri's mount.

251
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,359
The blue lion.

252
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,520
I found Maitreya's mount, the peacock.

253
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,080
Puxian's mount, the elephant.

254
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,719
None of you found Diting.

255
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,479
There's still one missing.

256
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,280
This riddle is definitely unsolvable.

257
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,239
Linlang.

258
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
You're the most familiar with this place.

259
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,479
Do you have any ideas?

260
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
There's a mountain outside the city.

261
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,679
It's called Diting Mountain.

262
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
Could that be Diting?

263
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,280
In the mountain.

264
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,599
It's such a big mountain.

265
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,599
Are we supposed to search the whole mountain for clues?

266
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,080
This...

267
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,599
Let's go.

268
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,280
Let's go.

269
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,159
It's actually quite funny when you think about it.

270
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,599
This turns out to be the ancestral hall of that muddle-headed magistrate's family.

271
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,719
And also,

272
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,000
It's only separated from our Lu family by a wall.

273
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,239
Why is it you guys again?

274
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,919
Hmm.

275
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,520
Since fate keeps bringing us together,

276
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,559
Then,

277
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,000
New grudges and old ones,

278
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,080
Let's settle them all together.

279
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,440
Since I was young, my father taught me

280
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,039
to respect the deceased.

281
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,080
Even though I'm no longer a coroner,

282
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,679
if they know in the afterlife,

283
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,679
they'll surely bless us to find the treasure soon.

284
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,479
Linlang.

285
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,200
Thank you for your advice.

286
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,320
I understand now.

287
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,400
Look, everyone.

288
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,039
This mechanism

289
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,080
is actually connected to the one in the jewelry box.

290
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,239
They share the same origin.

291
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,640
If that's the case,

292
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,039
we can solve the puzzle using the same method.

293
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,719
But

294
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,520
the patterns here should match the reliefs.

295
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
This kind of physical work

296
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,119
should be left to me.

297
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,239
Are you okay?

298
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,359
Why don't we go back for now

299
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,840
and come back another day after we've figured it out?

300
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,559
No.

301
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,960
Luming City is watching us closely now.

302
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,919
Who knows if there are others waiting to take advantage?

303
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,599
Father risked his life to protect the treasure.

304
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,080
He didn't even care about his own life.

305
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm his daughter.

306
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,440
This little injury is nothing.

307
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,719
Let me do it.

308
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,599
How dare you break into the magistrate's ancestral hall!

309
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,119
You have no idea of your own limits.

310
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,880
If it weren't for you,

311
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,119
I never would have thought of the Faceless Treasure.

312
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
It was right under my nose all along.

313
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,760
If that old man found out,

314
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,239
he'd probably never rest in peace.

315
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,119
Look at you now.

316
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,079
How are you any different from our dead father?

317
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
You killed your brother.

318
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,199
You murdered your father.

319
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,280
Don't mention that old man to me.

320
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,439
He never treated me as his son.

321
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,119
He didn't even see me as a person.

322
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,119
You think you suffered a lot in Tianluo, don't you?

323
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,319
Let me tell you,

324
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:01,719
I endured just as much humiliation by his side as you did.

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
He's just like Dugu.

326
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,880
They're all the same.

327
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,280
They'd sacrifice their own children for their selfish desires.

328
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,359
If you know this is wrong,

329
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,839
why do you still act this way?

330
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,839
I'm not like him.

331
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,560
What is he, anyway?

332
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,920
I will dominate the martial world and unite the land.

333
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
I'll crush him under my feet.

334
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,839
I'll show him

335
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,439
that I'm a thousand times stronger than you.

336
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,439
Ten thousand times stronger.

337
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,239
In the end,

338
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,880
you and I are both victims of this farce.

339
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,520
All these years,

340
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,040
the kindness you've shown me—

341
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,520
I don't believe it was all an act.

342
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,160
Brother,

343
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,319
it's not too late to turn back now.

344
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,520
Are you trying to lecture me like that old man?

345
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,560
Are you alright?

346
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,119
Where is this?

347
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,920
This

348
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,839
is actually beneath the Lu residence.

349
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
I remember now.

350
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
I came to this place seven years ago.

351
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,000
Inside here

352
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,640
is the Wuxiang treasure.

353
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,880
Luming City

354
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,560
If you knew the treasure you’ve been searching for

355
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,680
was so close at hand,

356
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,239
wouldn’t you be furious?

357
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,920
You actually found the Wuxiang treasure seven years ago?

358
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,160
Why didn’t you open it?

359
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,359
At that time,

360
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,400
while investigating Master Luo’s past,

361
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,119
I learned that my mother wasn’t dead

362
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,520
but was hiding on Lonely Mountain.

363
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,760
To me,

364
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,359
compared to family,

365
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,560
family is definitely more important.

366
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,800
It’s just a pity

367
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,599
Fortunately,

368
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
everything is in the past now.

369
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,920
I want to see

370
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,479
what kind of treasure could unite the world.

371
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,079
Don’t you want to know?

372
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
What’s the point in knowing?

373
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,839
Because of it,

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
the martial world has been in constant turmoil.

375
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,400
Countless lives have been lost.

376
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,920
For hundreds of years,

377
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,359
my ancestors hid the whereabouts of the Wuxiang treasure

378
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,479
for good reason.

379
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,719
Only if it disappears forever

380
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,640
can the world know peace.

381
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,880
I agree.

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
Alright, alright.

383
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,079
You two have always been of one mind.

384
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
I’ll have to give in as well.

385
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,359
I understand.

386
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,560
Even if someone comes here with the key,

387
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
they still can't open this door.

388
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,800
Because

389
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,160
they are missing one crucial factor.

390
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
The heir of the Luo family.

391
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,079
Master Luo and Linlang

392
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,239
both carry a unique fragrance.

393
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,400
The Luo family heir is compassionate.

394
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,880
They take saving the people as their mission.

395
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,079
Only such a person

396
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
can protect this treasure.

397
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,599
Linlang,

398
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,959
since you have been chosen,

399
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,239
do not let down

400
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
the intention behind it.

401
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,800
Mm.

402
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,599
How could this happen?

403
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,239
Don't think you can keep the treasure for yourselves.

404
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,839
Don't even think about keeping the treasure.

405
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
Blueprints of weapons from the previous dynasty,

406
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,439
and the craftsmanship left by Luban,

407
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,719
the skills and secrets here

408
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,359
will surely benefit all craftsmen in the world.

409
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,719
Shennong Bencao Jing,

410
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Treatise on Cold Damage,

411
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,119
are all medical books.

412
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,680
Related to criminal justice,

413
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,040
Zheyu Guijian,

414
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,359
Xiyuan Lu,

415
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,560
Yiyu Ji,

416
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,040
There are also books about incense making here,

417
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,640
such as Chen's Incense Manual and Incense Knowledge.

418
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,640
There are also books about agriculture and sericulture,

419
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
like Nongsang Yizhilu,

420
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,719
and Qimin Yaoshu.

421
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
There are also books

422
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,719
related to commerce,

423
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,319
such as Guanzi Qingzhong,

424
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
and Discourses on Salt and Iron.

425
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,680
So, in other words,

426
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,880
the books here

427
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,079
cover all professions, from scholars, farmers, artisans, to merchants.

428
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,239
Whether it's the highest or lowest of the nine classes,

429
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,680
they are all related to this.

430
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,079
I understand now.

431
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,000
Whoever obtains the treasure will rule the world.

432
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
But this treasure

433
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,160
is not gold or silver,

434
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,479
nor is it martial arts manuals.

435
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,680
It's something every commoner can learn

436
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,239
—practical skills.

437
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,160
I get it now.

438
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,439
As long as you have skills and are willing to work hard,

439
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,800
you won't go hungry.

440
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,839
You can support your family and help keep the country stable.

441
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,920
This is the true foundation for uniting the world.

442
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,439
However,

443
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,920
it's rather sad when you think about it.

444
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,359
They fought over this treasure

445
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,839
for half their lives,

446
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,439
but never realized

447
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,719
it was something they never even cared about.

448
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,479
Then let's show them

449
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,640
the true power of this treasure.

450
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,479
Twenty years ago

451
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:29,880
Doctor Luo Feng, in order to keep the martial world at peace,

452
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,839
founded the Fenglei Hall to save lives and heal the wounded

453
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,400
and benefit all under heaven.

454
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,479
But he was targeted by villains.

455
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:40,079
The treasure the Luo family had guarded for a hundred years

456
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,760
was exposed to the world.

457
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,439
It is said

458
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,439
that whoever obtains the Wuxiang Treasure can rule the world.

459
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,280
For a time,

460
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,079
the ambitious turned on each other and fought fiercely.

461
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,880
Luo Feng

462
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,239
was also killed by the hands of bandits.

463
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,319
Since then, the treasure's whereabouts have remained a secret.

464
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,160
Now,

465
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,520
Luo Feng's daughter, Luo Linlang,

466
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
by a twist of fate,

467
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,119
has reopened the treasure.

468
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,839
The so-called treasure that can rule the world

469
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,640
is actually the skills held by the common people.

470
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,520
Scholars,

471
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,400
farmers,

472
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,359
artisans and merchants,

473
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,359
are all the foundation of the world.

474
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,640
Now, the classics of all professions are made public.

475
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,359
Only the diligent

476
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,040
can enjoy wealth.

477
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,560
Only the benevolent

478
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,560
can rule the world.

479
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:28,760
This is truly a great thing for the country and the people!

480
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,040
Yes, indeed!

481
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,160
It's over, it's over.

482
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,119
This isn't even an official notice.

483
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,920
Let's go.

484
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,959
Th-this...

485
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,719
I knew it.

486
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Miss Linlang is destined for greatness.

487
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,760
Only I

488
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Only I can find the Wuxiang Treasure.

489
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,880
Only I can unite the world.

490
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,119
Only I can.

491
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't believe it.

492
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,920
I don't believe it.

493
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,160
Only I

494
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,839
Only I can find the Wuxiang Treasure.

495
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,479
Only I can unite the world.

496
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,319
Go away.

497
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,800
I am Lumingcheng.

498
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,920
Only I can find it.

499
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,760
Only I can find the Wuxiang Treasure.

500
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,239
I don't believe it.

501
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,800
I don't believe it.

502
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
Only I can.

503
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,439
Only I can find the Wuxiang Treasure.

504
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,079
Only I can unite the world.

505
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,000
Only I

506
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,319
Master Geng, are you really going to retire to the mountains?

507
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,920
The Fenglei Hall cover-up case

508
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
has finally been redressed.

509
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,479
Dugu deserved his fate.

510
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,959
Although His Majesty issued a decree

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,280
to restore me to my position,

512
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,439
as the head of the Investigation Bureau,

513
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,359
I know well that Tianluo is gone.

514
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,959
The Investigation Bureau now holds too much power.

515
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,880
It will surely become a new threat to the court.

516
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,280
Master Geng does not seek fame or fortune.

517
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,959
It is truly admirable.

518
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,199
After Miss Baiyu returned to the capital, there has been no news of her.

519
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,760
Master Geng, aren't you going to look for her?

520
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,959
She has regained her status as a princess.

521
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,400
She should

522
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,880
return to her original life.

523
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,479
Jiu'er and Linlang

524
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,040
are busy with matters at Fenglei Hall.

525
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,880
Master Geng, why not stay a little longer?

526
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Say goodbye to them before you leave.

527
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,400
No need.

528
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,719
If fate allows, we will meet again.

529
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,119
Farewell.

530
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,839
Farewell, farewell.

531
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,000
Master Geng.

532
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,199
While you were at Gushan,

533
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,040
you learned so many things you shouldn't have.

534
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,400
And now you want to just leave?

535
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,520
What do you want to do?

536
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Master Geng.

537
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
The rest of your life is over.

538
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,760
The leader of Fenglei Hall, Luo Linlang,

539
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
shared the treasure with the world.

540
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,680
Since then, every profession

541
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,719
has made great progress.

542
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,599
Every household has had plenty to eat and wear.

543
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,439
You have to admit, Master Luo is truly remarkable.

544
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,319
Even though she's a woman,

545
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,199
she aspired to be a legendary detective since childhood.

546
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,000
That's right.

547
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,119
Yes.

548
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,439
I can vouch for that.

549
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,199
Tell us about it, back then—

550
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
The first time I saw Lady Luo,

551
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,800
I thought she was incredibly heroic.

552
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
Definitely not an ordinary person.

553
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:14,920
That day,

554
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,359
she was in the teahouse's backyard

555
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,400
and discovered an unidentified woman's corpse.

556
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,800
She stayed calm in the face of danger.

557
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,000
With such a long leg bone in hand,

558
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,959
she rushed straight into my private room.

559
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,319
All these things you're saying—

560
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,239
This...

561
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
What kind of story is that?

562
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Let me tell you all,

563
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,680
just half a month ago,

564
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,560
Lady Luo herself

565
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,319
handed me the leg bone.

566
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,640
It was nothing, really.

567
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,119
In that very private room.

568
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,119
Everyone, look—

569
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,479
That day,

570
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,400
Lady Luo and I were having a matchmaking meeting there.

571
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,719
Believe it or not.

572
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,000
It's up to you whether you believe it.

573
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,319
Lady Luo and Lord Lu

574
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,239
first met over there.

575
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,800
So, in that case,

576
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,040
actually, I could be considered their

577
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,000
matchmaker.

578
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,119
Anyway,

579
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,959
Lady Luo

580
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:16,760
is the top female detective today.

581
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,760
Alright.

582
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,319
Okay.

583
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,239
Are you still listening or not?

584
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,560
When it comes to matters about Master Luo,

585
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,040
I have the most authority to speak.

586
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,640
Alright, let me tell you a story.

587
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,520
Lady Luo listened to Mr. Zhang's storytelling.

588
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Someone died.

589
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,920
Hurry and find Lady Linlang.
