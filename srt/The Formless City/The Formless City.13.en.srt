1
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Alone

2
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
It's not that easy

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
to completely cut ties with the past.

4
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,320
These are just ordinary clothes.

5
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,520
There aren't any new clues.

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,960
I thought you had some real skills,

7
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,399
but it turns out that's all there is.

8
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
If that's the case,

9
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,479
then please, Miss Yemei, enlighten us.

10
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,800
Pick up the clothes.

11
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,399
Shake them out.

12
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,240
Iron powder.

13
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,479
Yes.

14
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
It's iron powder.

15
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,000
To show respect for the deceased,

16
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,600
we always burn incense and wash our hands before rituals.

17
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,600
So,

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
this couldn't have come from the temple.

19
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
Sima Kong's clothes.

20
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,559
Iron mine.

21
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,559
Even though your memory hasn't returned yet,

22
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,279
but

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,160
we still work together as well as before.

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,279
But with your abilities,

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,199
why did you only notice these clues now?

26
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,720
Because I used to work in the yamen,

27
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,919
I was always the one to check these things before.

28
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,320
That's why

29
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,440
I end up causing more trouble than help.

30
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,160
But it's all right.

31
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,199
From now on,

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,759
I'll always be by your side.

33
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,240
What are you looking at?

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
You bastard.

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
You think you're worthy of learning our Tianluo martial arts?

36
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,639
Looks like someone is jealous that Feiying gets to inherit the teachings.

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
My father's unique martial art, Tiger Claw Fist, right?

38
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Miss, we...

39
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Get lost.

40
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't worry.

41
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,040
From now on,

42
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,480
as long as I'm by your side,

43
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,320
no one will dare bully you.

44
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,320
Senior sister.

45
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,519
You remember me now.

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
I just...

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
remember some fragments.

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,720
But

49
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,440
thank you for protecting me in the past.

50
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,119
So you're Lu Jiu's senior sister.

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,720
No wonder you're so capable.

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,239
Of course.

53
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,239
The two of us have been close since childhood.

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,559
Ordinary people can't compare to us.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
Alright.

56
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,600
This isn't the time to talk about that.

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,399
Since Sima Kong and those missing men

58
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,519
are all connected to the iron mine,

59
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,239
let's keep investigating based on this clue.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
There's only one iron mine in Wu Town.

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,279
If we go during the day,

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
we'll easily be spotted.

63
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,880
We should wait until night.

64
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,079
Then we can make a detailed plan.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,679
Mm.

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,119
Giddy up.

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,000
Giddy up.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,119
Whoa.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
We’ve finally arrived.

70
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,760
Mist Town.

71
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,799
It’s the border between Lone Mountain and the outside world.

72
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,760
No one governs this place.

73
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,320
I’ve heard that even if a major crime happens here,

74
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,799
it won’t reach the imperial court.

75
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,399
Now that I see it,

76
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,559
the atmosphere here really is strange.

77
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,119
Looks like you did your homework.

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Of course.

79
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,279
Many years ago,

80
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,959
the martial world was led by the Fenglei Hall.

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
There was peace everywhere.

82
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,519
But ever since the hall master Luo Feng and his wife died tragically,

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,160
Fenglei Hall fell apart.

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,920
No one managed the martial world anymore.

85
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,000
Pillaging and violence became rampant.

86
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,160
His Majesty had no choice but to order a crackdown.

87
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,000
Li Chu, for his own gain,

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,079
betrayed Fenglei Hall.

89
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,200
But I never expected

90
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,640
it would trigger chaos in the martial world.

91
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,559
Overnight, rivers of blood were spilled.

92
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,679
To escape the authorities' pursuit,

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
they all gathered on this lonely mountain.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,760
The mountain is located at the intersection of four provinces.

95
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,920
It involves many parties.

96
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,040
Over time,

97
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,440
it became a place of divided rule.

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,279
Then do you know

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,119
if we have any other purpose for coming to Mist Town this time?

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,279
Of course,

101
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,959
it's to follow Lu Jiu and investigate the secret of the Wuxiang treasure.

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,559
The road ahead is dangerous.

103
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,519
If you don't want to get involved,

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,799
Of course I am willing.

105
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,320
No matter how dangerous the road ahead is,

106
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,399
as long as I'm with you,

107
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,799
I won't say no.

108
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,799
Alright.

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Then I'll protect you.

110
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,559
Giddy up!

111
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,720
What did he mean by that?

112
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,359
Giddy up!

113
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,279
It's roasted—eat it while it's hot.

114
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Linlang,

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,119
you eat some first.

116
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,200
I roasted the rabbit.

117
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,600
Why should I give it to someone unrelated?

118
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,720
How could she be unrelated?

119
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,559
Then who is she to you?

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,200
I...

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,399
He and I are just ordinary friends.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
The past has always been a knot in his heart.

123
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,399
I hope you can help him untie it soon.

124
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,480
At least you have some self-awareness.

125
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,119
You...

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
This sachet is really ugly.

127
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,839
Aiju.

128
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,799
You don't know he was born with a keen sense of smell.

129
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,440
He especially hates this kind of smell.

130
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,519
I haven't known him for very long.

131
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,959
Of course, I don't know him as well as you do.

132
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,200
Give it to me.

133
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,000
After all these years,

134
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,920
people change.

135
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,799
Mugwort repels insects.

136
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,079
And in Mist Town,

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,359
it's the perfect choice.

138
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,960
Linlang,

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
don't listen to her nonsense.

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,239
It's getting dark.

141
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,039
It's time to investigate the cave valley.

142
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,960
You...

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Why do you always have to upset her for no reason?

144
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,440
She almost took you away from me.

145
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,960
Of course I don't like her.

146
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,239
Fei Ying,

147
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,719
you belong to me.

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
If you still want to stay here,

149
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,239
then don't tell anyone

150
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,559
that I'm Fei Ying.

151
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
This should be it.

152
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,840
You two go distract them.

153
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,280
I'll go into the cave to investigate.

154
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,919
No way.

155
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,440
You don't know martial arts.

156
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,479
Let me go instead. Your martial arts skills are unreliable.

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,039
At least I still have my strength.

158
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,719
It's safer if I go in.

159
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Hey!

160
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,919
You two really treat me like I'm invisible.

161
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,719
It's so late,

162
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,320
and there are still carts transporting ore.

163
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,000
There really is something suspicious.

164
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
You said before

165
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,239
that pitch-pot and archery are must-have games for rich young men.

166
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,119
Is that right?

167
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,679
Fei Ying

168
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,760
What's wrong with you?

169
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,559
This mark

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,159
I think I've seen it before.

171
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,919
Drugged person

172
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Yes.

173
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
Drugged person.

174
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,599
They want to turn Sima Kong into a drugged person.

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,799
To be controlled by others.

176
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,239
If it really comes to that,

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,919
I might not be able to save him even if I try.

178
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,919
Since that's the case,

179
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,400
Sima Kong must be in danger.

180
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,919
Why are we wasting time by coming back?

181
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
We must go save him right away.

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,960
Wait.

183
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,159
Once drugged people are involved,

184
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,559
The mastermind behind it must be extraordinary.

185
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,000
It could very likely be Tian.

186
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,799
What did you say?

187
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,000
It's very likely.

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,119
It's Tian Luo.

189
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,719
Tian Luo?

190
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
How do you know?

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,559
That's because... Anyway,

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,119
Once Tian Luo is involved,

193
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,119
then the Diancha Division and the imperial court

194
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
will step in and interfere.

195
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,239
We need to plan carefully.

196
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,359
I don't expect you to believe me.

197
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,320
But you must believe in yourself.

198
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
You said

199
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,359
No matter what I become,

200
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,200
I will never forget who I was.

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,799
Mm.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,359
Is there something you can't say in front of Xu Linlang?

203
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,520
You're asking even though you already know.

204
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,320
What is it?

205
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,679
Are you scared?

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
The honor of being Tianluo's top assassin

207
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,119
was earned with your blood.

208
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,719
And now, for this woman,

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
you're hiding your true self.

210
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,919
That's not who I am.

211
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,239
Stop lying to yourself.

212
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,280
These days,

213
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,559
you've been remembering more and more.

214
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,000
You know better than anyone

215
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,919
what Fei Ying used to be like.

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
That's all in the past.

217
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,320
I won't allow you to say a word to Linlang.

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,400
In the end, it's all for this woman.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
As long as she's dead,

220
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,559
we can go back to how things were.

221
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm warning you.

222
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,039
If you so much as touch Linlang,

223
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,479
I won't let you get away with it.

224
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,799
And I don't care

225
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,479
what we had in the past.

226
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,320
Why do you two seem so strange today?

227
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,679
It's all thanks to a certain someone.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Lu Jiu,

229
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,520
don't be so harsh with Miss Ye Mei.

230
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,640
Even though her personality is a bit extreme,

231
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,880
I can tell

232
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,599
she truly cares about you.

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
I know that.

234
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,080
Didn't you say we should take our time and plan carefully?

235
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,520
So why did we come here?

236
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,679
I remember you said before

237
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
for cases with no clues,

238
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
we need to observe

239
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,359
the paths the victims once walked,

240
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,919
and the places where they lived.

241
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,400
Have you noticed anything about this place

242
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,039
that's different from other places?

243
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,679
Nine out of ten homes are empty.

244
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,359
Almost every family has lost their men.

245
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,159
Of course it's different.

246
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,320
You used to work for the authorities too.

247
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,559
Didn't you notice there's no yamen here?

248
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,239
That's right.

249
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,799
A man went missing the day before yesterday.

250
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,960
It's not that the yamen doesn't care,

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,280
it's that there isn't a yamen at all.

252
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,479
Mist Town is a place between the imperial court and the martial world.

253
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,599
No one pays attention to it.

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,359
The mastermind chose to commit the crime here.

255
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,799
Probably because of this reason.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,760
You knew all along.

257
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,880
Why didn't you say so earlier?

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,039
Someone wouldn't let me talk too much.

259
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,320
Be serious.

260
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,400
Since there's no local authority,

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,039
then the common people

262
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,520
naturally won't be questioned.

263
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,159
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

264
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Maybe the killer

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,400
is hiding among them.

266
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,320
That's right.

267
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,119
The killer might be right beside us.

268
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,080
When we were shopping before, you said

269
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,320
this kind of embroidered fabric

270
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,559
is very expensive, right?

271
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,559
You even went shopping with her?

272
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,000
This isn't the time to talk about that.

273
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
This fabric

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,960
the pattern

275
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,400
looks like something a Taoist would wear.

276
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,320
But what kind of Taoist

277
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,960
would be so extravagant?

278
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,359
Where are you going?

279
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Master's thirst illness has flared up.

280
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,119
He asked me to get two doses of medicine.

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Go quickly and come back soon.

282
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,000
Master can't eat without someone attending him.

283
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,400
Got it, got it. I'll go now.

284
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,359
This Taoist priest sure puts on airs.

285
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,640
I never have anyone serve me when I eat.

286
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,760
I heard they say the priest has a thirst illness.

287
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:26,880
This illness

288
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,559
is usually caused by eating too much greasy food.

289
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,000
A person devoted to cultivation

290
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,679
has come down with such a rich man's disease.

291
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,359
It seems the temple really does hold clues.

292
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,679
Benefactor.

293
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,719
What brings you here?

294
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:43,119
The people from Diancha Si left in such a hurry.

295
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,320
It's not because of us.

296
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,080
It must be because of this case.

297
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,919
No matter their reason,

298
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,919
they can still help us.

299
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,159
My child,

300
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,640
I have buried your clothes and hat.

301
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,039
Rest in peace.

302
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,479
May you, down below,

303
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,320
never be bullied by the old woman of Yin Mountain again.

304
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,320
You really believe it was the old woman of Yin Mountain?

305
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,679
Who are you people?

306
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,840
How dare you desecrate the dead here?

307
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,119
Diancha Si, Geng Zhao.

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,799
Lord Geng

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
Our wilderness

310
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,119
has never had dealings with the imperial court

311
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,280
We don't know why Lord Geng has come this time

312
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,119
What is the purpose?

313
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,119
It's nothing much

314
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,280
I heard that in town

315
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,640
many people have been kidnapped

316
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
so I came to take a look

317
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Kidnapped?

318
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,919
If the divine constable says it's kidnapping

319
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,919
then it must be kidnapping

320
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,760
My son is still alive

321
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes, he's not dead. My son is still alive

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,799
Earlier

323
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,559
a young girl from out of town said

324
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,840
the people weren't killed, they were taken away

325
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,320
Why didn't we believe her?

326
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,200
The girl from out of town you mentioned

327
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,719
Is it her?

328
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,520
Yes, yes, that's her

329
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,119
Master

330
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,080
Master

331
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,320
Mind your manners

332
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,239
How improper to be so flustered

333
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,520
Hurry and greet Lord Geng from the Inspectorate

334
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,159
There really is an Inspectorate lord

335
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,760
Someone just left these clothes at the temple entrance

336
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:05,359
They said it's for Lord Geng of the Inspectorate

337
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,239
When I looked

338
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
isn't this from that day

339
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,239
left behind by the person taken by Granny Yinshan?

340
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,560
I thought I was seeing a ghost

341
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,800
People from the Assassin Alliance

342
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,199
Linlang

343
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,959
Are you really going to see Geng Zhao to discuss the case?

344
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,640
This matter concerns the drugged people

345
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,920
With just our strength alone

346
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm afraid we can't compete with the mastermind behind all this.

347
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,359
Working with Geng Zhao

348
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,079
is our best option right now.

349
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,959
But last time at the Iron Wall Treasury,

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,079
we made fun of him.

351
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,199
I'm worried he

352
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,520
doesn't trust you.

353
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,119
I don't think that's necessarily true.

354
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,239
After all, Miss Xu is someone Geng Zhao values,

355
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,160
and placed by your side to keep an eye on you.

356
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,359
Lu Jiu, listen to me.

357
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,359
You don't need to say anything more.

358
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,599
All along this journey,

359
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,680
if you wanted to harm me,

360
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,160
you've had countless chances.

361
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I trust you.

362
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,800
Lu Jiu.

363
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,640
Are you finished?

364
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,239
If we don't leave now,

365
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,479
Geng Zhao will be gone.

366
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,239
Lu Jiu,

367
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,079
the murder charge against you hasn't been cleared yet.

368
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,319
Let us handle finding Geng Zhao.

369
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,640
It's better to leave it to us.

370
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,719
Miss Ye Mei is highly skilled in martial arts.

371
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,359
We will definitely return safely.

372
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,239
That's right.

373
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,319
I will make sure to protect her.

374
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,880
Before you leave,

375
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,239
leave the sword behind.

376
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,160
Otherwise,

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,439
Geng Zhao will think you're not sincere about the negotiation.

378
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,640
That's true.

379
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
This sword was originally our engagement token.

380
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
It's best for you to keep it.

381
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,959
There's no one more suitable.

382
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,800
Engagement?

383
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,640
Yes.

384
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,280
My Tiger Head Sword and your Tiger Claw Blade

385
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,439
are a matching pair.

386
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,839
When we got engaged,

387
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
Father gave them to us.

388
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,479
Fei Ying,

389
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,160
from today onward,

390
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,119
I entrust my daughter to you.

391
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,479
In the future,

392
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,119
Tian Luo will belong to both of you.

393
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,079
Lin Lang,

394
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,040
I...

395
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,599
It's getting late.

396
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,000
We really have to go.

397
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:32,959
Lin Lang,

398
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,640
please let me explain.

399
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,479
There's nothing between us.

400
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,640
You don't need to explain to me.

401
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,199
Right now, I only want to save Sima Kong and those people.

402
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,119
Everything else has nothing to do with me.

403
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,079
Lin Lang, I...

404
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,119
Why do you always at critical moments

405
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,760
talk to her about all sorts of irrelevant things

406
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,680
You only asked me to keep

407
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,000
the secret that you are Fei Ying

408
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,119
You never said I couldn't talk about these things

409
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,520
If you want to blame someone, blame her bad luck

410
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,359
No one knew you earlier than I did

411
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,959
I could kill her even without a sword

412
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,479
I won't kill her

413
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,319
only because of you

414
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't worry

415
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,719
My Tiger Head Sword and your Tiger Claw Blade

416
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,880
were always a pair

417
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,319
When we got engaged

418
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,680
Father gave them to us

419
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,359
You used to work in the yamen.

420
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,239
You should know

421
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,079
that when handling a case,

422
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,119
one must stay focused.

423
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,000
Only then can you overcome your enemies.

424
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,959
You have never been my enemy.

425
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,000
With your skills in criminal investigation,

426
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,920
I'm afraid you already know

427
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,920
the true identity of the missing person, don't you?

428
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,959
The Jade-faced Scholar.

429
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,359
The second-ranked assassin in the Assassin Alliance.

430
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,079
He originally came for us.

431
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,920
But unexpectedly, he failed here.

432
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,760
Whoever could capture him and Sima Kong

433
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,239
must not be an ordinary person.

434
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,640
That's why I want to seek your help.

435
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,319
Let's bring the mastermind to justice together.

436
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,199
There are still accomplices lying in ambush nearby.

437
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,359
Is this your idea of cooperation?

438
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,800
One should not harbor the intent to kill.

439
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,359
But one must always be cautious of others.

440
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Besides,

441
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,719
don't you have accomplices as well?

442
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,280
This time,

443
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,439
I truly want to cooperate with you.

444
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,800
After all, my friend has been captured by them.

445
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,160
Lying to you would do me no good.

446
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,280
I, Geng Zhao, have never misjudged anyone.

447
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Not once.

448
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
So you agree, then?

449
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,479
Before I agree,

450
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,920
I need to confirm something.

451
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,680
Why do you

452
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,760
associate with Tian Luo, the one who killed your father?

453
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,880
Lin, Linlang

454
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,719
You

455
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,959
What's wrong with you?

456
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,560
She

457
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,119
Actually, we should thank that officer from the Diancha Division.

458
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
If it weren't for him,

459
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,520
Miss Xu wouldn't have found out so quickly.

460
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,599
That you are Fei Ying.

461
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,079
Linlang

462
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,199
Listen to me.

463
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,920
Even Sima Kong hid this from me before.

464
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,400
Our original intention was all for

465
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:55,880
you.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,760
Geng Zhao

467
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,520
Sima Kong

468
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,160
Even she knows everything.

469
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,319
I'm the only one who didn't know.

470
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,760
Let me explain.

471
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Sima Kong and I

472
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,719
kept this secret because

473
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,560
we were afraid it would harm you if it got out.

474
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,920
But my father was killed by Tianluo.

475
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,959
How could you make me be with my father's killer?

476
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:10,719
No,

477
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,920
No wonder you were so afraid.

478
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,719
She knows your true identity.

479
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,760
If I had known earlier,

480
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,199
I should have had my father's men

481
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,520
kill her too.

482
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,400
Shut up!

483
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:21,839
Linlang

484
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,239
You have to let me explain.

485
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,000
From today on,

486
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
I, Xu Linlang, and you

487
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,040
are finished. All ties are severed.

488
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,079
Linlang

489
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,119
Linlang, Linlang

490
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,160
Is she the only one in your heart?

491
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,319
Am I worth nothing in your eyes?

492
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,040
I am the daughter of Dugu, the leader of Tianluo.

493
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,599
High and mighty

494
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,479
For you,

495
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,760
I have compromised again and again.

496
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,160
I know this isn't fair to you.

497
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,680
But in my heart,

498
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,839
there's no room for anyone else.

499
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,920
Feiying

500
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,599
Don't you think

501
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,839
that after she learns your true identity,

502
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
she would still want to come back to you?

503
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,119
Come back to Tianluo with me.

504
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,199
Yemei

505
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Feiying

506
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,719
both belong to the night.

507
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,079
We understand each other better than anyone.

508
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,920
No one can separate us.

509
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,199
But after staying in the darkness for too long,

510
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
one starts to long for the light.

511
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Linlang is my light.

512
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,319
From the first time I saw her,

513
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,560
she was.

514
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,560
Even if she sees you as an enemy,

515
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,359
you would still abandon me for her.

516
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,119
To be with her.

517
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,439
Let me ask you one more time.

518
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,400
Will you come back with me or not?

519
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,439
I know you've helped me a lot before.

520
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
If you want,

521
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,199
just take my body back with you.

522
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,479
Consider it my repayment to you.

523
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Even if you die,

524
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,959
you still wouldn't want to be with me.

525
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,319
I will definitely make you return to how you were.

526
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,839
Isn't it because I'm worried about you?

527
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:00,119
The clothes Xu Linlang left at the temple during the day

528
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
were clearly meant to lure you in.

529
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,680
If you can think of it,

530
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,239
do you think I can't?

531
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,839
Then why do you still want to see her?

532
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
Don't tell me you still want to take her as your apprentice.

533
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,719
Can't you focus on something serious for once?

534
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,839
I understand.

535
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,599
Men in town have mysteriously disappeared.

536
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,479
One of them is Xu Linlang's friend.

537
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
She used to be a coroner.

538
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,920
Naturally, she can help us save a lot of time.

539
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,839
Then tell me,

540
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,520
what clues did you find out today?

541
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
According to her,

542
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,439
the kidnappers are hiding in the iron mine in the eastern suburbs.

543
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,800
You believe everything she says?

544
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
Last time at the Iron Wall Warehouse,

545
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,199
didn't she say she would work with us?

546
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:35,920
And what happened?

547
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:36,959
As members of the Investigation Bureau,

548
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,359
solving cases is our top priority.

549
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,000
Should we hold back just because we're worried about our own safety?

550
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,079
Should we cower in fear

551
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,000
and stop moving forward?

552
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,920
I... I thought you had matured a lot.

553
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,640
But I didn't expect

554
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,760
you're still that sheltered young lady who knows nothing of hardship.

555
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Of course I don't understand the grand principles you talk about.

556
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,239
And you don't understand what I'm thinking.

557
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,160
Tomorrow's auction

558
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,839
How are the preparations going?

559
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Master, please rest assured

560
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Everything is ready

561
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,040
We guarantee that all our distinguished guests

562
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:14,959
will arrive in high spirits

563
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
and leave satisfied

564
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,160
Very good

565
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,239
Make sure everything is arranged properly

566
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,239
There must not be any mistakes

567
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,560
Yes, Master

568
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,560
I suppose

569
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,359
these are the buyers

570
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,199
Don't be impulsive

571
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,560
Why are you here?

572
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,719
Didn't I say

573
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,199
that I have nothing to do with you anymore?

574
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,119
At these underground auctions

575
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,719
there's usually a pass code

576
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,520
Didn't you see

577
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,959
that they all have entry passes?

578
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,959
How do you know?

579
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,800
I

580
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,000
have been following you all along

581
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
That's true

582
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Fei Ying, the top assassin of Tianluo

583
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
is known for tracking skills

584
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,439
Linlang

585
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,079
I kept things from you before

586
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,199
That was my fault

587
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,119
But now

588
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,599
aren't you just like me

589
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,880
with the same goal?

590
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
To rescue Sima Kong

591
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,079
Put this on.        What is it?

592
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,439
I checked.

593
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,400
Today's sellers.

594
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,359
There's a couple.

595
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,479
I took their clothes and travel permits.

596
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,160
I brought everything.

597
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,160
It's that simple.

598
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,839
Tie them up.

599
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,079
Just tied them up for now.

600
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,400
I haven't forgiven you just like that.

601
00:28:58,959 --> 00:28:59,800
Before,

602
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,719
you said Sima Kong had ulterior motives.

603
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,760
But we needed someone like him along the way.

604
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,119
Now,

605
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,479
I just need you

606
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,760
to help me save someone, that's all.

607
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:10,880
Let's go.

608
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,959
Put it on.

609
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,719
Here.

610
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,760
Alright, let's go.

611
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,760
Wait.

612
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,680
Blood Scorpion, Tianxiong, Amethyst.

613
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,680
Qianhu, Bajiji, Guiding Star.

614
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Let me take a look.

615
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,719
This lady is very young.

616
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,520
She looks like an unmarried girl.

617
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,760
My wife has always enjoyed shooting arrows into pots.

618
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,160
Shooting at these lifeless things

619
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,199
isn't very interesting.

620
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,800
So, I came to see

621
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,040
if there are any living targets.

622
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,239
You will surely be satisfied with this visit.

623
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:57,920
Please.

624
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,760
Thank you.

625
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,119
It seems your ability to lie without blinking

626
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,199
is truly innate.

627
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,400
That person is still watching.

628
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,439
Let me take you to see my batch of goods.

629
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,800
This hole here.

630
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,160
No one even bothered to fix it.

631
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,439
What if my wife trips and falls because of it?

632
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,959
No one's following us now.

633
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,199
You don't have to pretend anymore.

634
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,599
Do you think I've ever pretended with you?

635
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,560
Do you think I would still believe what you say?

636
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,839
I know you hold resentment in your heart.

637
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,439
Once we rescue Sima Kong,

638
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,959
I'll keep my distance from you.

639
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,160
I won't disturb your life.

640
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,079
That's true.

641
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,319
You should return to your original life anyway.

642
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,560
That's not what I meant.

643
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,319
Madam, don't be anxious.

644
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,239
Slow down.

645
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,400
Here.

646
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Madam.

647
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's go.

648
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,040
This one won't do, it's too skinny.

649
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,760
Gentlemen, I'm talking about this one.

650
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,319
Let's pick a smaller one.

651
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,040
What's the price for this?

652
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,319
Let me introduce it to you.

653
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,239
There are so many people.

654
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,160
How are we supposed to find them?

655
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,280
Look at that sickly one.

656
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,760
Why are you looking at him?

657
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,400
Not that one, not that one.

658
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:50,959
No.

659
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,760
It's too noisy.

660
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,760
It's hard to tell.

661
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,160
Where's the sachet I gave you?

662
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,000
This one is just too skinny.

663
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,719
It's not quite right.

664
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,719
How is it?

665
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,920
There are too many spices over there.

666
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,040
It still doesn't work.

667
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,760
Then what should we do?

668
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,439
Let's go, hurry up.

669
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,239
Let's go.
