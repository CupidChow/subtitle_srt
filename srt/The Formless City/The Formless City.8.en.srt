1
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,559
I am Lu Jiu.

2
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,320
Are you having a fever again?

3
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,240
Didn't you promise not to do anything to her?

4
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,160
I...

5
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,559
Even Lian Bu Ci...

6
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,679
Can't even handle two kids.

7
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
What a useless person.

8
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,080
Don't say that.

9
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,880
With this fever,

10
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,199
your martial arts have actually improved a lot.

11
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,279
Weren't you the one who said it?

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,479
You have to learn to control your body, don't let him control you.

13
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,559
All of you, be careful.

14
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,759
Behind us.

15
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,240
Linlang.

16
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,559
Let her go.

17
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,880
The person you're looking for is me.

18
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,919
She's worth more than you.

19
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm really curious.

20
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,639
This little girl,

21
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,160
why is she worth such a high bounty?

22
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,440
Wait.

23
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,559
If there are more assassins behind us,

24
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,759
Linlang is injured now.

25
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,119
I can't protect her completely anymore.

26
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,240
Who needs your protection?

27
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,119
Didn't you see just now?

28
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm so strong.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,399
This isn't the time to be stubborn.

30
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,080
From now on,

31
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,800
I won't allow you to leave my side, not even half a step.

32
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,440
Pass down the order.

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
When pursuing Xu Linlang,

34
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,720
do not harm her life.

35
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,959
You're actually doing this for Xu Linlang.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,239
You want to use people from the Diancha Division.

37
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,239
She hasn't even agreed to be our informant yet.

38
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,040
Li Chu, on the Assassin Alliance's hit list,

39
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,679
Fei Ying,

40
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,720
are all connected to the Fengleitang case from twenty years ago.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,440
Xu Linlang is inexplicably involved in this.

42
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,839
There must be a connection.

43
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,160
Excuses.

44
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,079
I think you have ulterior motives.

45
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,519
You always only take on cases assigned by the court.

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,679
But in Luoyang County,

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
you took on Xu Linlang's case file.

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,079
And now you're going easy on her.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,959
I think

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,799
I...

51
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,480
I think you clearly have a thing for her.

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
I just think

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
she's good material for investigations.

54
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,359
I want to recruit her into the Diancha Division.

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,880
Although the Diancha Division accepts talent regardless of gender,

56
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,559
all these years,

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
very few women have been able to join.

58
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,279
Still won't admit you like her?

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,239
You're being unreasonable.

60
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,720
Don't think I don't know.

61
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,959
From my very first day in the Diancha Division,

62
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,480
you've never liked me.

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,279
You're always looking for excuses to send me back to the capital.

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,519
I just won't do as you wish.

65
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,279
Now I'll give the order to protect Xu Linlang.

66
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,679
So you can't find a single fault with it.

67
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,079
Cold.

68
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,119
Cold.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Lu Jiu.

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,399
How are you?

71
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,720
Cold.

72
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,200
Sima Kong went to get some medicine.

73
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,079
He hasn't come back yet.

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,440
Young Master.

75
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,040
Let me go in and check the situation.

76
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,079
Have you found out who was after Linlang?

77
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,480
We finally found out.

78
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,920
The one behind this secret plot

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,679
is actually the eldest son of the Lu family, who has been missing for a long time.

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,119
Lu Mingcheng.

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,799
Father, please calm your anger.

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,799
You've grown up and become bold.

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,320
You dared to order the Assassin Alliance to kill your own brother.

84
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,320
Father, I am innocent.

85
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,720
I specifically told them

86
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,839
not to harm Xiao Jiu's life.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,239
Just bring him back, that's all.

88
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,519
I went to find the Assassin Alliance

89
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,640
only because I was worried our people

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
might expose your whereabouts, Father.

91
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,679
If you truly cared about your brother,

92
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,839
why did you leave him in Luoyang County in the first place?

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
I received news

94
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:47,920
saying that

95
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,160
Geng Zhao from the Investigation Bureau secretly entered Luoyang County

96
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,200
to investigate our Lu family.

97
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,040
I was afraid

98
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,119
it would reveal Father's true identity.

99
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,399
That's why I came up with a plan to escape at the last minute.

100
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,119
Xiao Jiu being captured

101
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,720
was truly an accident.

102
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,399
So it's both a misunderstanding and an accident?

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,799
I've raised him for seven years.

104
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,600
And almost lost everything because of you.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,799
Tang Sect

106
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
Before I faked my death, the Tang Sect

107
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,679
had already taken action.

108
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,679
This Tianluo

109
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,519
Tianluo is also a major client of the Tang Sect.

110
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,600
It's very likely

111
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,839
that this old villain Dugu is scheming behind the scenes.

112
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,519
Then

113
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,239
he conveniently shifted the blame onto Father.

114
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,160
Dugu

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,959
and that Xu Linlang

116
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,160
Dugu clearly knows

117
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,799
her father was a former member of Fenglei Hall.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,799
Yet he still appointed her

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,000
to stay by Xiao Jiu's side.

120
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,119
I'm afraid

121
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,480
they have ulterior motives.

122
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,399
That's why I ordered someone to kill her.

123
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,480
You and I are father and son.

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,559
If we are united,

125
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,079
we can seize the Wuxiang treasure together.

126
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:54,720
Yes, yes.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,880
Fortunately, the fever has gone down.

128
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,239
Come in.

129
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,000
Lu Jiu wasn't feeling well all night.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
He kept tossing and turning.

131
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,520
So,

132
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,599
yesterday,

133
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,440
you stayed by the bedside the whole time.

134
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,640
Thank you for your hard work.

135
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:10,919
Oh, you mean that?

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
It wasn't hard for me.

137
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,719
By the way,

138
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,599
didn't you say you were going to get medicine for Lu Jiu last night?

139
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,559
Why didn't you come back?

140
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Did you really want me to come back?

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,280
Of course I wanted you to come back.

142
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,159
After all, you went to get medicine for Lu Jiu.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,679
Lu Jiu's fever is gone,

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,599
but why hasn't he woken up yet?

145
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,400
I haven't been paid yet.

146
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,919
I won't let him die so easily.

147
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:40,960
Sima Kong.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,919
Are you crazy?

149
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,159
Wrong.

150
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,479
You're the crazy one.

151
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,320
Lu Jiu, you're finally awake!

152
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,520
I...

153
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,479
Did I get a fever again?

154
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,799
I didn't faint this time.

155
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,280
Why

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,719
do I still get a fever?

157
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,960
No matter the reason,

158
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,400
anyway,

159
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,080
Linlang stayed by your side all night.

160
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,880
As long as you can recover,

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
nothing else matters.

162
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,919
But,

163
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,280
we...

164
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,520
how did we end up at the inn?

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,080
If we rashly come to the inn,

166
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
then the Assassin Alliance

167
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,119
would easily find us, wouldn't they?

168
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,359
That's what I said too.

169
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,080
But Linlang insisted for the sake of your health.

170
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,119
She was determined to do it this way.

171
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,239
It's fine.

172
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,719
Someone will protect us.

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,919
Near the inn,

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
I found signs that the authorities are watching us.

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,599
They're just watching us from a distance.

176
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,320
They don't seem to want to arrest us.

177
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
They even seem to want to protect us.

178
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,760
Protect us?

179
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,559
Yes.

180
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,400
It should be related to this.

181
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,799
What is this?

182
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,200
A bounty notice from the Assassin Alliance.

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,320
Your bounty is now ranked third.

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,320
It's two hundred chiwen more

185
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,039
than the two of us.

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,320
How much has he actually recovered, Fei Ying?

187
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,400
In one person's mind,

188
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,799
there are memories of two people.

189
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,479
How could such a miraculous thing exist in this world?

190
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,840
Maybe he's just pretending.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,960
Let me test you.

192
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,479
Sima Kong, what are you doing?

193
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,280
Looks like you're not pretending.

194
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,640
Pretending? What do you mean?

195
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,640
Your martial arts today

196
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
have improved a lot compared to yesterday.

197
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,280
It seems you're awakening deep memories in your body.

198
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,840
But back then, you were clearly

199
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,799
a useless person with no martial arts at all.

200
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,559
Sima Kong.

201
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,679
You can analyze all you want,

202
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,559
but stop calling people useless all the time.

203
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:34,840
Stop calling people useless all the time.

204
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,719
Sima Kong

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,200
Look at what you've done.

206
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,159
You just had to test my strength in the bathroom.

207
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,719
Linlang is a girl, after all.

208
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,719
You made her so embarrassed.

209
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,479
I tested you

210
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,760
for your own good.

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,840
As for Linlang,

212
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
I didn't expect things to turn out like that.

213
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,679
Easy for you to say.

214
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,400
Don't you want to know

215
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,039
who the other person inside you is?

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Do you know who it is?

217
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,159
I don't know yet.

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,039
But one thing is certain:

219
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,119
You are still yourself right now.

220
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,799
You haven't been taken over by that person yet.

221
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,599
I'm just afraid

222
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,039
I'll completely become that person.

223
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,640
The authorities are investigating. Everyone, come out!

224
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,679
Linlang

225
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,280
Let's go.

226
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,760
Did someone just pass by?

227
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,239
I don't know, did you see anyone?

228
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,359
Let's go.

229
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,679
Lu Jiu

230
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,039
Get a hold of yourself.

231
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,919
Don't be like this.

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,520
Lu Jiu

233
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,440
Lu Jiu

234
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,400
Lu Jiu

235
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,119
Linlang

236
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,080
Are you okay?

237
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Sima Kong

238
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,719
Sima Kong

239
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
You almost killed me just now.

240
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,280
The inn was just undergoing a routine inspection.

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,799
You suddenly transformed and took Linlang away.

242
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,280
I followed you out of concern, but you...

243
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,280
You forgot about us again.

244
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,599
These days,

245
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,239
it's happening more and more often.

246
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,840
I feel like

247
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,919
I'm becoming someone else.

248
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,159
Someone else...

249
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,039
Did you remember something?

250
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
Ever since thirteen years ago,

251
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,840
when I fell into the river,

252
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
I haven't remembered anything.

253
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,960
When I woke up, they told me

254
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,039
my name is Lu Jiu.

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
The second young master of the Lu family.

256
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,119
But in my heart,

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
there's always a voice telling me

258
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,679
I'm not Lu Jiu.

259
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,960
Maybe

260
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,559
your memory was faulty from the very beginning.

261
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,559
Do you still remember

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,239
how you lost your memory?

263
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,239
Ever since I fell into the river

264
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,640
and had a fever,

265
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,479
I haven't remembered anything.

266
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,239
Fei Ying disappeared in Mist Town.

267
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,239
There's a river nearby.

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,280
According to what you said,

269
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
all your memories are what others told you.

270
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,840
Have you ever tried to confirm with other relatives or friends?

271
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,159
In my family,

272
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,840
there's only my elder brother and my father.

273
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
As for my mother,

274
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,799
my father said

275
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,559
he and my mother were only briefly together.

276
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,640
After I was born,

277
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,559
she abandoned me.

278
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,200
It was my father who went to great lengths

279
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,520
to find me and bring me back.

280
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,039
This Lu Kun is truly shameless.

281
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,400
He even made up

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,359
such a mask of loyalty and righteousness for himself.

283
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,719
Everyone knows he first abandoned his original wife,

284
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,919
tricked someone into marriage to gain status,

285
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,000
and later left the third master of Fenglei Hall

286
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,359
without a second thought.

287
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
He even abandoned his child.

288
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,479
I am my father's illegitimate child.

289
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,520
So,

290
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not close to him.

291
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,679
The last time I saw him

292
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,119
was when he

293
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,239
left me with my elder brother.

294
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,919
But I am still grateful to him.

295
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,640
If it weren't for him,

296
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,359
I would have died long ago.

297
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,840
You said you lost all your memories from seven years ago.

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,719
And suddenly, you possess unparalleled martial arts skills.

299
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
On this wanted poster,

300
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,039
there happens to be someone just like that.

301
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,640
Who is it?

302
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,200
Fei Ying.

303
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,760
The top assassin of Tianluo.

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
He excels at stealth and theft.

305
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,280
He kills without a trace.

306
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,239
He dominates the martial world with Tiger Claw Fist.

307
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
He vanished without a trace seven years ago.

308
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,919
He's about the same age as you.

309
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,719
Tiger Claw Fist?

310
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,719
There's a portrait of him on here.

311
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,039
Do you still want to see it?

312
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,119
Yes.

313
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,960
This child's features,

314
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,520
do look quite similar to mine.

315
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,719
If it weren't for this black mole,

316
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,919
there might really be a misunderstanding.

317
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,520
So if someone asks you in the future

318
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,559
whether you are Fei Ying,

319
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,880
you can confidently tell them

320
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,760
that you are not.

321
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,880
If you're not, then you're not.

322
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,640
Why are you taking it so seriously?

323
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,400
The young sect leader used Fei Ying's wanted notice

324
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,840
to test Lu Jiu.

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,119
That's right.

326
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,000
It's just a pity

327
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,559
that although Lu Jiu possesses the martial arts of Wuxiang City,

328
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,119
his childhood appearance

329
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,640
does not resemble Fei Ying.

330
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,959
So it's more likely that

331
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,959
all these years, Fei Ying

332
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,280
has been staying with the Lu family.

333
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,479
Lu Jiu's martial arts

334
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,920
were taught by him.

335
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Do you doubt what I said?

336
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,119
No, not at all.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,239
I just feel that

338
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,479
it's been quite a while since we left the Miasma Forest,

339
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,280
so why is the young sect leader only contacting me now?

340
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,239
Don't worry.

341
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,479
About borrowing your medicine,

342
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,239
I haven't forgotten.

343
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,079
I've followed you for so long,

344
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,959
how could I possibly fuss over a mere medicine?

345
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,160
How could I care about that?

346
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,280
Is that so?

347
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,079
I didn't realize you were so loyal to me.

348
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,359
I am deeply loyal to you.

349
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,359
But the one you should be loyal to is not me,

350
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,400
but Tang Sect.

351
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,319
Master chose you to help me accomplish great things

352
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,520
not only because of your outstanding skills,

353
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,880
but also because of your unwavering loyalty to Tang Sect.

354
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,719
You set aside personal gain and loss,

355
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,640
and put the interests of Tang Sect above all else.

356
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,479
That is the duty of a Tang Sect disciple.

357
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
The Sect Leader has high hopes for you.

358
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,920
Though he may be strict,

359
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,359
when he sees you

360
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,800
considering everything for the benefit of Tang Sect,

361
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,079
he will surely be gratified.

362
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,680
Since Lu Jiu isn't Fei Ying,

363
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,959
there's no need for you

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
to waste time on him.

365
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,239
Why not come back with me to report?

366
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,319
Although Lu Jiu isn't Fei Ying,

367
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,920
he is Li Chu's son.

368
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,719
Li Chu, under the alias Lu Kun, has been hiding for a long time.

369
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,239
He must have a plan.

370
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,719
Now, both he and Fei Ying

371
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:35,719
and Luming City

372
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,880
are all missing.

373
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,160
So Lu Jiu

374
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,079
is our only clue.

375
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,079
You are truly thoughtful.

376
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,119
I, Lao Yan, will take my leave.

377
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,719
Alright.

378
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,000
Lu Jiu

379
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,280
I can only help you this far.

380
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,839
Take a look at the lanterns.

381
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,280
Please have a look at the lanterns.

382
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Little trinkets.

383
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,439
Come and have a look.

384
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,880
Miss, take a look at these little trinkets.

385
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
Here, have some candied hawthorn.

386
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,920
How is it?

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,199
It tastes good, doesn't it?

388
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:12,959
It's delicious.

389
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,599
Can you buy it for me again next time?

390
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,439
No problem.

391
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,319
I'll buy it for you every day from now on.

392
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,560
The past was beautiful.

393
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,359
But what if Lu Jiu gets sick again in the future

394
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,239
and forgets me again?

395
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
I'll give you this notebook.

396
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,959
Notebook.

397
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,800
You can write down whatever you want to remember

398
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,760
and all the most important things in it.

399
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,319
That way, you won't forget.

400
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,079
Linlang's hands are used for dissecting corpses.

401
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,439
I didn't expect her to be so skilled at making notebooks.

402
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,680
Could it be

403
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,199
made from human skin?

404
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,439
I've just been nice to you for two days and you're already asking for trouble, aren't you?

405
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,839
Lu Jiu

406
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,959
Where are you going?

407
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,640
Where did they go?

408
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,520
Where is that fragrance coming from?

409
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,359
Here, hold this.

410
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,160
Here you go.

411
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,520
Let me put it on you.

412
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,479
How is it? Looks nice, right?

413
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Yeah.

414
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,560
I knew you'd like it.

415
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,239
Let's go.

416
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,439
Flowers for sale!

417
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Sir, buy some flowers.

418
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
Buy them for your beloved.

419
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,839
I'm back.

420
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,040
You're back.

421
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,119
I went into the woods

422
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,439
and hunted some game.

423
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,839
We'll have an extra meal tonight.

424
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,000
You can't even tell a lie.

425
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,119
You suddenly went out just now

426
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,280
because you were afraid you'd hurt me when you transformed, right?

427
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,160
I...

428
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm afraid I'll forget you.

429
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
It's not what you think.

430
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,079
Besides, every time you forget me,

431
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,079
it's only for a short while.

432
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,560
Once you regain your memory, you risk your life to save me.

433
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,160
That makes up for it, doesn't it?

434
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,640
But I feel

435
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,319
I'm about to be completely controlled by that person.

436
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,040
So

437
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,599
I'm giving you this notebook.

438
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:59,560
Write down the most important things you want to remember

439
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,880
in it.

440
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,839
That way, you won't forget.

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,640
Okay.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
I will.

443
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,959
It's getting late.

444
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
I'll go make dinner now.

445
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,119
So you remember the most important thing.

446
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,680
Why are you drawing me?

447
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,640
Because

448
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,479
the thing I can't forget the most

449
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,439
is you.

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,239
Then can you give me this drawing?

451
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:35,599
Sure.

452
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,520
I'll definitely treat it as my most precious thing.

453
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
I'll keep it safe.

454
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,959
Um, Linlang, I...

455
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,560
There's something in my eye.

456
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,439
Really.

458
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
Who knows what dirty thing he saw.

459
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,479
Let me help him.

460
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,079
No, that's not it.

461
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,800
You can't insult yourself either.

462
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,439
I'm just trying to cooperate with you.

463
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,880
Let me do it.

464
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,760
Let me see what's in your eye.

465
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,079
That's really not necessary.

466
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,439
Let's be serious.

467
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,880
Seriously.

468
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,959
Every time you transform, you hurt Linlang.

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,800
We need to find a solution.

470
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:47,839
Are you sure

471
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,599
this is the method you mentioned?

472
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,959
That's right.

473
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,760
It's so uncomfortable for Lu Jiu to be tied up like this.

474
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Besides,

475
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,280
with his strength when he transforms,

476
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,359
this rope can't possibly restrain him. Don't worry.

477
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,160
This is a special rope I made.

478
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,839
Not even ten oxen could break it.

479
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,000
I...

480
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,800
Sir,

481
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,880
sorry to bother you.

482
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:09,920
Please, go on with your business.

483
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,119
No, it's not that...

484
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,119
See? This was your terrible idea.

485
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,640
Do you have a better idea then?

486
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,760
Alright, alright.

487
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
Let's hurry up and eat.

488
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:19,760
Okay.

489
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,880
You've worked hard taking care of him these days.

490
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,280
You should really take care of yourself.

491
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,199
I...

492
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,359
Don't listen to him.

493
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,920
You look well-off,

494
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,599
but actually,

495
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,400
when he comes back,

496
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,160
he'll make you pay him back double.

497
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,640
Starting today,

498
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,599
you'll be in charge of all the money.

499
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,719
What do you mean by that?

500
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,359
Until you explain clearly,

501
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,680
I don't dare take it.

502
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm not as shady as some people say.

503
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,640
I'm giving you the money

504
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,239
because I think it's more appropriate.

505
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,319
Um...

506
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm hungry.

507
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,000
I want to eat chicken.

508
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,959
Sima Kong.

509
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,079
Add more money.

510
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,040
Alright, alright, let me feed you.

511
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,319
Wait.

512
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,640
You've worked so hard.

513
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,439
This is just a small thing.

514
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,640
Let me handle it.

515
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,119
Eat chicken.

516
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,880
Is this really how you feed someone?

517
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,880
No extra charge.

518
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,119
This is the only service available.

519
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,880
Alright, alright.

520
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,000
You two are still like children.

521
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,119
Let me feed you.

522
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,239
I don't know if hiding Lu Jiu's background from Master

523
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,719
was right or wrong.

524
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,719
But at this moment,

525
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,760
having friends like this by my side

526
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,160
is truly different from being alone in the past.

527
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,520
No need.

528
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,599
Let me do it.

529
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,199
No extra charge this time.

530
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,239
Did he really say that?

531
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:43,040
The young master always has his reasons.

532
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,599
Old Yan sent a message.

533
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,040
He said he didn't dare to speculate.

534
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,000
Old Yan

535
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,599
reported this to me in private.

536
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,040
I suppose

537
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,119
he's already figured it out.

538
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,199
Raising a child

539
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,439
is like making this mechanism.

540
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,160
Sometimes there are rough edges.

541
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,400
Just smooth them out.

542
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,079
As long as Kong'er completes this mission successfully,

543
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,760
he will still be our young master.

544
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,839
If you're really uncomfortable

545
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,199
I'll untie you

546
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,599
It's fine

547
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,239
With you by my side

548
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,560
It doesn't matter how I'm tied up

549
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,680
I feel safe

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
Then get some sleep

551
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I'll be right there

552
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,359
Call me if you need anything

553
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay

554
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,199
What is this place?

555
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,160
White Pagoda Temple.

556
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,599
Linlang

557
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,079
Linlang

558
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,640
Shopkeeper, could you please take a look for me?

559
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,680
I need to get some medicine.

560
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,839
Miss, you're here for medicine again?

561
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,319
Your husband’s health isn’t very good, is it?

562
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,319
He’s always taking medicine.

563
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,560
He’s not my husband.

564
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,760
He’s just a friend.

565
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,479
Then he must be a very important friend to you.

566
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,040
You’re willing to use such expensive herbs for him.

567
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,560
I just made a new discovery about his illness last night.

568
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,800
I adjusted the prescription according to medical texts.

569
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,079
I didn’t know these herbs were so expensive.

570
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,680
Shopkeeper,

571
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,959
How much do these herbs cost?

572
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,239
Ten taels of silver.

573
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
Ten taels?

574
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,239
That’s so expensive!

575
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,239
Good thing Sima Kong gave me money.

576
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,079
Oh no.

577
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
My purse is missing.

578
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:32,880
Shopkeeper,

579
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,280
I didn’t bring enough money.

580
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,640
Could you let me buy on credit for now?

581
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,439
Once I get to Mist Town and find my family,

582
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,640
I’ll bring you the money then.

583
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,880
Mist Town is so far from here.

584
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,160
If I wait for you to pay me back,

585
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,680
Who knows how long that will take?

586
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,880
Miss, I run a small business.

587
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I don’t give credit.

588
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,119
I hope you understand.

589
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,560
Doctors are supposed to be compassionate.

590
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,239
Can’t you make an exception just this once?

591
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,479
Stop trying to fool me.

592
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,599
You quack doctor.

593
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,479
My face is just a bit stiff.

594
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,400
I got two prescriptions from you and it didn’t help at all.

595
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,599
It actually got worse.

596
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,959
Please don’t get upset.

597
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,319
The medicine takes time to work.

598
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,239
I told you that when I gave you the medicine.

599
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
I have an important business deal coming up.

600
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,319
But now I look like this.

601
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,760
How am I supposed to do business like this?

602
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,439
Sir, please don’t get angry.

603
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
I know some medicine too.

604
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Why don’t you let me see the prescription the shopkeeper gave you?

605
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,760
Let me take a look.

606
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
You, a young girl, know medicine?

607
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,079
Go ahead and take a look.

608
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,160
You’ve got nothing to lose anyway.

609
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:26,800
Alright.

610
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,959
You two don’t seem to be working together.

611
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,280
Here’s the prescription.

612
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,839
The prescription uses the right medicine.

613
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,079
The dosage is fine too.

614
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:41,319
Then why am I not getting better?

615
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,319
If you trust me,

616
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,719
I can try acupuncture for you.

617
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,239
Alright.

618
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,599
I’m a grown man.

619
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,920
I’m not afraid of a few needles.

620
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,079
Shopkeeper,

621
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,359
Can I borrow your acupuncture kit?

622
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,560
Alright.

623
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,920
Alright.

624
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,199
Alright, alright, really.

625
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,560
It really is.

626
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,959
My face isn't stiff anymore.

627
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,560
Miss,

628
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,880
you're truly a miracle doctor.

629
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,040
These few acupuncture needles I used

630
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,199
were just for emergency treatment.

631
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,280
They'll only last for half a day.

632
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,239
But it's enough for you to meet with your boss.

633
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
For the rest of the treatment,

634
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,520
you need to follow the prescription the shopkeeper gave you

635
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,280
and take your medicine properly.

636
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,599
Make sure not to leave any lingering illness.

637
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Alright, alright.

638
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,359
Miss,

639
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,239
you've really helped me a lot.

640
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,359
When my restaurant opens in the future,

641
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,640
you must come and visit.

642
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,079
I have to thank you properly.

643
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,439
Wait a moment, Miss.

644
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,479
You haven't taken the medicine you just picked up.

645
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Didn't you say you don't allow credit?

646
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,839
Not allowing credit is indeed our shop's rule.

647
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,760
But the money for your medicine

648
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,239
comes from your consultation fee.

649
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,560
Really?

650
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,560
Doctors are compassionate by nature.

651
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,800
Thank you, shopkeeper.
