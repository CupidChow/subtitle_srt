1
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,680
Sir

2
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,360
There's something wrong with these assassins.

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Although their weapons have no markings,

4
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
the craftsmanship in their making

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,520
is the same as the group who killed Xu Linlang's father.

6
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,240
When did you investigate Xu Linlang's father's case?

7
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,240
Wasn't it because you kept saying

8
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
that Xu Linlang's case file was well written

9
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,119
and her investigative methods were professional?

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,759
So I wanted to look into her background.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe Xu Linlang

12
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,240
could be the key to controlling Lu Jiu.

13
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,080
Li Mu

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,000
Let Linlang go.

15
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,240
What are you planning to do?

16
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,639
Since everyone is here,

17
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,960
I'll officially begin.

18
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
You must not harm Linlang.

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,440
She's about to become my wife.

20
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,759
Why would I hurt her?

21
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,279
You want to give her my face.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
I've already given you the anesthetic.

23
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,720
When you wake up,

24
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,360
you'll already be my wife.

25
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,639
I want all of you

26
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,240
to be buried with me.

27
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Lu Jiu

28
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,959
I don't ask to live together

29
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,760
Lu Jiu

30
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,559
but only to die together.

31
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,119
My wife,

32
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,239
I'm coming.

33
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,279
Logically,

34
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,799
news from the young master

35
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,839
should have arrived by now.

36
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,279
Why hasn't the carrier pigeon

37
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
arrived yet?

38
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,880
I'll wait for you outside.

39
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,600
Okay.

40
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
You two,

41
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,359
won't you stay a few more days?

42
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,959
Oh no.

43
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,320
Could something have happened to the young master?

44
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,559
What's wrong?

45
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,959
Seeing yourself kill someone

46
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,880
it's hard to say you don't feel bad.

47
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
You killed a truly evil person.

48
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,279
You didn't do anything wrong.

49
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,559
They kill for their own selfish desires,

50
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,160
but you did it to save me.

51
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,480
You did nothing wrong.

52
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,839
After coming out of the Miasma Forest,

53
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,359
you started acting very strange.

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,959
What exactly is going on?

55
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,959
I'm not sure either.

56
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,359
I just feel

57
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,799
rather anxious.

58
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,200
You've suspected I have ulterior motives

59
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,720
for quite some time now.

60
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
Why not be more direct?

61
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,200
You've misunderstood.

62
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,000
By the way,

63
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,440
do you still remember

64
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,720
the piece of silk found in Li Mu's wife's corpse?

65
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,839
I've seen it.

66
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,119
Could it be the Nine-layered Fragrant Cloud Silk?

67
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
Nine-layered Fragrant Cloud Silk—

68
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,440
a treasure of Fenglei Hall.

69
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
It can preserve a body for ten years without decay.

70
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,959
That's why Li Mu's wife's body

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,239
could be so well preserved.

72
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,480
But ever since twenty years ago,

73
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,640
when Fenglei Hall was destroyed,

74
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,160
no one has seen the Nine-layered Fragrant Cloud Silk again.

75
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,679
How do you know about this?

76
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Our family of coroners

77
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,160
has heard many tales of spirits and mysteries.

78
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,559
My father told me all of this.

79
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,559
Let's set that aside for now.

80
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,920
In your elder brother's secret chamber,

81
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,359
there was actually a treasure from Fenglei Hall.

82
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,839
Maybe his whereabouts

83
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,040
are connected to the old Fenglei Hall case.

84
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,040
Then let's set out immediately

85
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,040
for Mist Town.

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,959
Wait.

87
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,679
Before we leave,

88
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,040
I think there's something

89
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,239
even more important.

90
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,160
Martial arts can be a weakness

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,119
but they can also be a weapon.

92
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,000
But I just can't control myself.

93
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,480
Then learn to control it.

94
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Don't let it control you.

95
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,559
Look.

96
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,959
This is what it means to control it.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
I see.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,799
Teach me a few more moves.

99
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:19,720
Okay.

100
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,279
So this is what it feels like to know martial arts.

101
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,839
Lu Jiu, you've figured it out.

102
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,919
That's great.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
We'll be more confident on our journey now.

104
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,119
Yeah.

105
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,559
You even have spies?

106
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,280
No need to be surprised.

107
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,320
In the world of martial arts,

108
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,640
money can solve most problems.

109
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,640
No wonder you like making money so much.

110
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you done being amazed?

111
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,640
Now, there's some good news

112
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,119
and some bad news waiting for you.

113
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,880
The bounty on us from the Assassin Alliance

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
has doubled again.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
How is that good news?

116
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,320
The bounty has doubled,

117
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,880
so more people will be after you.

118
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,359
Not you.

119
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,479
Us.

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,559
Us?

121
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,359
You mean...

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
Linlang

123
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,479
is also on the Assassin Alliance's hit list?

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,799
That's right.

125
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,599
Even though Xu Linlang once saved him,

126
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,599
as a remnant of Fenglei Hall,

127
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,400
keeping her around is still a threat.

128
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't worry, Father.

129
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,559
I've already made arrangements.

130
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,760
But what did I do wrong?

131
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,799
It's fine to make your own decisions.

132
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,080
But don't be like Lu Jiu.

133
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,359
Don't forget whose son you are.

134
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,640
Yes, yes.

135
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,359
The bad news is,

136
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,559
Can I not hear it?

137
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,559
I just found this in Li Mu's secret room.

138
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,400
This.

139
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,719
The design on this gold coin is exquisite.

140
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,520
I've never seen it before.

141
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,479
This is Chiwen.

142
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,000
It's often mentioned in storybooks.

143
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,239
Chiwen is the currency used by people in the martial world.

144
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,479
Now we have enough money to travel to Water City.

145
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,359
How is that bad news?

146
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,559
The bad news I mean is,

147
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,440
Li Mu

148
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
is not an ordinary doctor.

149
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,919
I believe his death

150
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,719
will soon be spread around.

151
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,760
By then,

152
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,479
we'll attract even more attention.

153
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,359
What is Tiebi Bank?

154
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,239
The storybooks never mentioned that.

155
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,119
Go, go, go.

156
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
You talk too much.

157
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,159
Tiebi Bank

158
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,799
is the bank for people in the martial world.

159
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,559
You can enter with this jade pendant.

160
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,840
This jade pendant

161
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,840
What's wrong?

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

163
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,880
Fei Ying is an assassin from Wuxiang City.

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
He must have opened an account in the Iron Wall Vault.

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,960
If before he lost his memory

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
he kept the secret of Wuxiang City's treasure,

167
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
it might be in the Iron Wall Vault.

168
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,679
How did Li Mu get the Nine Satin Fragrant Cloud Silk?

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,280
Maybe we can find clues in the Iron Wall Vault.

170
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,760
So I suggest

171
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
before going to Mist Town,

172
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,280
we should go to the Iron Wall Vault first.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,799
Alright.

174
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,479
What do you mean by this?

175
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,039
This is your advance payment.

176
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,200
Just now, we were brothers risking our lives together.

177
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,039
Now

178
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
you're turning your back on me.

179
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Who's your brother?

180
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,960
Some people clearly said they couldn't control their transformation,

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,599
but they keep surprising us.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,239
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

183
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,280
I really don't know how I transformed.

184
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,280
I was back to normal when I woke up.

185
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
Both times I transformed,

186
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
besides being life-or-death situations,

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,440
there's another thing in common.

188
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,640
Hurry up and say it.

189
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
When you transformed,

190
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,799
Linlang was always by your side.

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,840
What does that have to do with me?

192
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
She and I are just ordinary friends.

193
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,200
There's no reason I'd transform because of her.

194
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,359
It'd better be that way.

195
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
That way

196
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,919
I won't have to worry about being dragged into your mess.

197
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,239
You keep changing back and forth,

198
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,719
who knows what you're thinking.

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,479
Lu Jiu, don't do anything foolish.

200
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,400
Letting the people you care about escape harm.

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,039
That's not foolish.

202
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,080
Could it be

203
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,159
I really was overthinking it.

204
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,200
Linlang.

205
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,719
Are you okay?

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
Lu Jiu.

207
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,119
Um...

208
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
It's getting late.

209
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
We should hurry and get going.

210
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,440
What are you thinking about?

211
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,280
Linlang.

212
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Linlang.

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,239
Linlang.

214
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,080
Lord Geng, what do you mean by this?

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,559
You once aspired to join the Diancha Office.

216
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,960
Has that changed now?

217
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,599
It hasn't changed.

218
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,359
It's just that...

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,440
Now I've been dismissed from the county office.

220
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm afraid I won't have that chance again.

221
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,479
Today, I...

222
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,840
will give you this chance.

223
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,880
Are you interested in being my informant?

224
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,719
Geng Zhao finally lost his composure.

225
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Linlang.

226
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,359
Linlang.

227
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,119
Linlang, Linlang.

228
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,599
Are you alright?

229
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,400
Why did you suddenly disappear?

230
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
You didn't even say anything.

231
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,679
Why are you being so fierce?

232
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,159
Where I go is none of your business.

233
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,760
I...

234
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,719
Let's stay at an inn.

235
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:20,960
I'll pay.

236
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,719
Sima Kong.

237
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
Why are you suddenly so generous?

238
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,559
I think he just dislikes how dirty it is here.

239
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,719
The environment here is terrible.

240
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,840
It's not suitable for Linlang, a young woman, to stay here.

241
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,520
The next town ahead

242
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
is at least half a day's journey away.

243
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,320
Aren't you afraid of the dangers of traveling at night?

244
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,919
And we're bringing Linlang with us.

245
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,159
Traveling at night does make it easy to fall into an ambush.

246
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,039
I'm not someone precious anyway.

247
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,359
Let's just make do for one night.

248
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,280
You two are really in sync.

249
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,119
I didn't realize you'd made up already.

250
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,760
Looks like I was meddling for nothing.

251
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,919
I'm just discussing the matter at hand.

252
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
You two stay here.

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,239
I'm the unnecessary one here.

254
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,280
I'll leave first.

255
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,960
Sima Kong.

256
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,719
You must be hungry too.

257
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
I'll go find something for you to eat.

258
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,599
When I was little, I often went bird hunting with my father.

259
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,440
I didn't bring a slingshot.

260
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,559
Ever since I transformed,

261
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,760
not only has my martial arts improved,

262
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,200
I've also gained sharper senses.

263
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,280
I really don't know what kind of person I used to be.

264
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,359
You just need to report Lu Jiu's whereabouts one by one.

265
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,799
Then you can join the Diancha Division.

266
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,320
For you,

267
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,799
it's all benefits and no harm.

268
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,679
Master Geng,

269
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,520
I've always seen you as my idol.

270
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,960
Because you are chivalrous and righteous, protecting the people from harm.

271
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
But now,

272
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,039
you're asking me to betray my friend.

273
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,359
Forgive me, Xu Linlang,

274
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,520
I cannot agree.

275
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,280
The person who killed your father

276
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,479
is from Tianluo.

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,959
In this world,

278
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,520
the only ones who can stand against Tianluo

279
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,199
are the Diancha Division.

280
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,520
Linlang,

281
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,520
what's wrong?

282
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Usually when you eat,

283
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,479
that's when you're happiest.

284
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,920
It's none of your business.

285
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,800
Hey, Young Master Sima,

286
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,280
are you really not eating?

287
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm currently fasting.

288
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,359
I can't eat or drink.

289
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,800
What a pity.

290
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,719
This big, fat, tender rabbit

291
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,199
is crispy on the outside and tender inside.

292
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,040
It's cooked just right.

293
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
It smells so good.

294
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,119
No fun.

295
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,359
One has no appetite,

296
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,839
the other doesn't want to eat.

297
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,719
I'm full too.

298
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,599
Then just throw it away.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,319
Eating too much can cause indigestion.

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,959
I'll help, though it's a bit of a stretch for me.

301
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,280
Thank you.

302
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,719
Ingredients.

303
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,560
One Chiwen.

304
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,520
Cooking.

305
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,560
One Chiwen.

306
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,599
How long are you two going to keep being stubborn?

307
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,520
We didn't really do anything.

308
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,560
Forget it if you don't want to talk.

309
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,119
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

310
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,800
Wasting ingredients.

311
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,239
Add one more Chiwen.

312
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,400
Ridiculous.

313
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Why am I so angry?

314
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,479
Throughout this journey,

315
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,000
you've worked hard.

316
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,839
What were you dreaming about this time?

317
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,160
Do you want to eat it?

318
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,839
Lu Jiu

319
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,839
What's wrong?

320
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,880
Are you having nightmares again?

321
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Lu Jiu

322
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,479
What's the matter?

323
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,599
I was just...

324
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,760
I thought I was dreaming.

325
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,119
You...

326
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,359
Did you dream about me?

327
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,560
No.

328
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,599
I...

329
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,839
I did dream about you.

330
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,959
But not that kind of dream.

331
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,199
It wasn't that kind of dream.

332
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,199
I never said it was that kind of dream.

333
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,719
Linlang

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,719
There's something I want to tell you.

335
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,239
The person who killed your father

336
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,640
is from Tianluo.

337
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,079
In this whole world,

338
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,680
the only ones who can stand against Tianluo

339
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,400
are the Diancha Division.

340
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,920
Actually, I've always...

341
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Me too.

342
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,160
You too.

343
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,400
Me too.

344
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,719
I also consider you a good friend.

345
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,319
And Sima Kong.

346
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,000
We're all good friends.

347
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,560
What did you do to her this time?

348
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,280
What could I possibly do to her? I...

349
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,839
I—I didn't do anything.

350
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,479
Maybe...

351
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,319
Maybe it's because I didn't do anything.

352
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,920
Lu Jiu

353
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,359
Don't blame me.

354
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:44,199
I'm also trying to find out who killed my father.

355
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,359
Are you okay?

356
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:55,199
I'm fine.

357
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Lu Jiu

358
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,680
Dislocated arm

359
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
The tendon is also sprained

360
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,079
What about Lu Jiu?

361
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,000
Just feels too ashamed to see you

362
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
I'm sorry.

363
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,239
I

364
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,880
didn't mean to hurt you.

365
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,160
This is for me.

366
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,319
It's so far from the town here.

367
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,599
You managed to come back so quickly.

368
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,599
It must have been tough on the way.

369
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,400
I

370
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,199
can only do this.

371
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,079
Don't worry.

372
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
This little injury is nothing.

373
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,040
Don't forget,

374
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,560
I'm a master at setting bones.

375
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,280
You don't have to comfort me.

376
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm serious.

377
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,239
When I was working on a case before,

378
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,599
the human bones were brought back to the office.

379
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,520
They happened to fall off the carriage.

380
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,680
And then another passing carriage ran over them.

381
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,839
They were scattered everywhere.

382
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,000
I managed to piece them all together.

383
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,680
Tell me, am I amazing or not, Linlang?

384
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,479
Can you

385
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,959
stop pretending it's fine every time?

386
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,359
If it weren't for me,

387
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,719
you would have reached Mist Town long ago.

388
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,160
No one would be chasing you.

389
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,040
And you wouldn't have been hurt by me.

390
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,479
None of this is your fault.

391
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,160
But my mind is a mess right now.

392
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,680
All my martial arts skills

393
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,959
might

394
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,560
come from

395
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,079
a cold-blooded killer.

396
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,560
I

397
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,959
don't want to hurt you.

398
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,079
You'd better stay away from me.

399
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,880
I won't let you become that kind of person.

400
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,280
As long as I'm here,

401
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,560
you won't forget the path you came from.

402
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,000
and you won't turn into a cold-blooded killer.

403
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,040
It seems my beloved disciple

404
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,640
is gradually regaining his memory.

405
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,520
Then the clues to the treasure he found before losing his memory

406
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,319
are about to be revealed as well.

407
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,359
Send a message to Lu Kun

408
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,439
and invite him for a meeting.

409
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,280
Yes.

410
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,640
Lord Dugu.

411
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
It's been a while, my lord. How have you been?

412
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,400
Speak of the devil, and he appears.

413
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,280
Brother Lu.

414
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,000
It's been years. How is your health?

415
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm getting old.

416
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,040
If not for your great fortune,

417
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,000
I probably wouldn't have lived to see today.

418
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,239
You're too modest, Brother Lu.

419
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,400
With your talent,

420
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,040
even without associating with me,

421
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,160
you could still achieve great things.

422
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,880
Your health still hasn't improved, Brother Lu?

423
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,239
At my age,

424
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,119
all I wish for

425
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,880
is to spend my remaining years under your protection,

426
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,560
and live out my days in peace.

427
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,079
Come,

428
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,040
please have a seat.

429
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,199
Sit, sit, sit.

430
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,119
After you, my lord.

431
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,880
It's getting cold as autumn sets in.

432
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,479
You should take care.

433
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:09,959
Servant!

434
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,280
Bring the imperial wine bestowed by His Majesty

435
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,560
and serve it to Brother Lu

436
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,119
to warm him up.

437
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,319
No, please.

438
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,160
My lord,

439
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,560
my body is weak

440
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,959
and I'm afraid I can't drink alcohol.

441
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Thank you, my lord.

442
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,760
Then let's have tea instead.

443
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,719
Brother Lu is in poor health.

444
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,280
Yet he still has to set up a scheme.

445
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,599
To lure Fei Ying back to Mist Town.

446
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,760
It's truly not easy.

447
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,000
Sir, you see things clearly.

448
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,719
For years, I have pretended to live in seclusion in Water City.

449
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:43,000
But in fact, I've been working for you in Mist Town all along.

450
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,319
I've never set up any scheme.

451
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,800
Back then, when Fei Ying lost his memory,

452
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,599
you and I made an agreement.

453
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:54,280
We would act when the martial world was calm.

454
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,079
And then plan this important matter.

455
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,719
This matter

456
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,800
is known to no one else.

457
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,479
But someone interfered.

458
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,680
Fei Ying almost fell into the hands of Geng Zhao from the Diancha Division.

459
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,400
Tell me,

460
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,640
what happened here?

461
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,680
Heaven and earth can bear witness.

462
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,439
I am absolutely loyal to you, sir.

463
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,800
I know your loyalty well.

464
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,040
Otherwise,

465
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,640
you wouldn't have abandoned the thriving Fenglei Hall

466
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,680
to join my Tianluo.

467
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,319
Isn't that right?

468
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,239
Li Chu.

469
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,199
These three, including Lu Jiu,

470
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,880
are now ranked third on the leaderboard.

471
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,280
Wasn't the initial bounty just one hundred Chiwen?

472
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,680
That's because at first,

473
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,439
no one knew he could fight.

474
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,599
Everyone thought he was just a spoiled young master.

475
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,119
Killing him would be as easy as killing a chicken.

476
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,239
Who would have thought Lu Jiu actually possesses extraordinary martial arts.

477
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,359
He's that powerful?

478
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:28,880
So,

479
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,959
is anyone still taking the job?

480
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,280
I doubt it.

481
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,119
Most likely,

482
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,000
it'll be just like Li Chu and Fei Ying.

483
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,479
They've had bounties for years, but no one has accepted.

484
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,439
By the way, Li Chu and Fei Ying—

485
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,839
how many years have their bounties been up?

486
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,000
Li Chu's bounty

487
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,040
must have been there for at least twenty years.

488
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,760
Fei Ying's has been six or seven years.

489
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,040
The reward goes up every year,

490
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,560
but still, no one takes the job.

491
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,680
Do you think it's because their martial arts are too strong,

492
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,520
or is it just impossible to find them?

493
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,920
Probably both.

494
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,800
The assassins who tried to kill them

495
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,319
never came back.

496
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,839
They all died.
