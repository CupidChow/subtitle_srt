1
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Lu Jiu's whereabouts

2
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,199
have already been discovered by the authorities.

3
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,559
It seems that around him

4
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,399
they have planted spies.

5
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
Hey.

6
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,880
Your bundle is torn.

7
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,759
Check if anything has fallen out.

8
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,279
The keepsake my birth parents left me is missing.

9
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,800
I didn't hear

10
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,839
anything fall along the way.

11
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,080
You were walking behind me, did you see anything?

12
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,000
Could it have fallen at the teahouse just now?

13
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,919
I'll go back and look. I'll go with you.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
You're wanted right now.

15
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,199
If you keep going back and forth on the main road

16
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,160
you're risking your life.

17
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,039
I'll take a shortcut and be back soon.

18
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,279
Be careful.

19
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Lu Jiu left the city in a coffin cart.

20
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,320
This is the route they must take.

21
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,479
Take the road on the right.

22
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,080
We’ll definitely catch up with them soon.

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,479
Why take this road?

24
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,199
This is the official road.

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,600
How could a group of wanted people dare to take it?

26
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,559
Investigating a case

27
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,600
requires not only investigative skills

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,759
but also learning

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
to think from a suspect’s perspective.

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,240
Are you saying

31
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,279
we have to become the perpetrator ourselves first?

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
If you put it that way,

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
are there any good people left in our department?

34
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,119
I understand what you mean.

35
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,399
You just mean thinking from the suspect’s point of view.

36
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,080
Lu Jiu

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
and the craftsman who helped him escape

38
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,160
will definitely try to mislead the authorities.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
They’ll definitely take the official road.

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,080
So, what do you think?

41
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,119
I’m smart, aren’t I?

42
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,199
Thank you, Master.

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
Don’t call me Master.

44
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,240
But—

45
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,119
I’ve heard some newcomers

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,679
call their mentors

47
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,399
by that title.

48
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,000
Not with me, you don’t.

49
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,039
He’s never been this angry before.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,279
Sir.

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,679
Sir.

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
Do you have any other instructions, Sir?

53
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,519
Be careful with everything.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
Thank you, Master.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,959
Let’s go.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,559
Even the Department of Investigation dares to meddle in Tianluo’s affairs.

57
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
Sir

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,640
Does Geng Zhao really think he can oppose me?

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,839
Inform the spies we have placed in the Diancha Division

60
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,640
I want to know Geng Zhao's every move

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Sir

62
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,880
The Diancha Division and Tianluo

63
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,200
are not under the jurisdiction of the Six Ministries

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
I have heard

65
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,239
before Geng Zhao left the capital

66
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,440
he met with His Majesty

67
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,119
I'm afraid

68
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,160
Afraid of what?

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,359
The establishment of the Diancha Division

70
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,760
is just the Six Ministries

71
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,959
envying the power of our Tianluo

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,720
and trying to appease us

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,440
What Tianluo can do for the court

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,000
is something even ten Diancha Divisions could never match

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,359
Sir, you are wise

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,959
The former members of Fenglei Hall

77
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,079
have they all been eliminated?

78
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,480
Sir

79
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,959
The death warriors sent out a few days ago

80
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,320
some of them haven't returned

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,239
What did you say?

82
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,920
That man is somewhat old

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,359
He has followed the rules for twenty years

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,359
only running a coffin business

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,079
and is timid by nature

86
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,799
I never expected

87
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:52,279
By the way

88
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,600
his daughter

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,679
is the coroner who overturned Lu Jiu's case

90
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,160
Xu Linlang

91
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,119
Xu Linlang

92
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,000
The keepsake my father gave me

93
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,440
must not be lost

94
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,160
They've been gone for so long and still haven't come back.

95
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,399
Did they get lost?

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,920
Look on the bright side.

97
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,799
Maybe

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,119
they were caught by the authorities.

99
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,679
Don't jinx it.

100
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
We're already

101
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,079
quite far from Luoyang.

102
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,440
I hope the county officers

103
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,399
haven't followed us.

104
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,920
That's not it.

105
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,320
This place is under the jurisdiction of the Zhen Nan military governor.

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,119
There are often soldiers patrolling here.

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,399
Why didn't you say so earlier?

108
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,519
Xu Linlang isn't on the wanted list.

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,519
She won't be in any danger.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,079
But it's different for you.

111
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,399
If you go, you'll only get her involved.

112
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,559
All of this

113
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,839
was planned by you.

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,040
That's right.

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,119
I just wanted to get rid of Xu Linlang.

116
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,600
Did you ever think

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Linlang helped us leave by pretending to be in mourning.

118
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,160
That's how she got us out.

119
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,959
If the city guards

120
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,239
notice she didn't return,

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,480
they'll suspect she's connected to us.

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,559
So what?

123
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,239
We've all left.

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,359
How can the authorities be sure

125
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,920
she was the one who helped us escape?

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,359
Officials can abandon their duties at any time.

127
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,839
She didn't do it for any benefit.

128
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,480
Risking her life to save someone she's only met a few times—

129
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,640
how could there be such a fool in this world?

130
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,160
Are you saying

131
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,000
Linlang was sent by the authorities to spy on me?

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,079
You finally figured it out.

133
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't know about anyone else,

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,959
but Linlang

135
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,559
she's not that kind of person.

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,079
If you're not afraid of dying from the poison,

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,160
then go ahead.

138
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,799
Now that you're poisoned,

139
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:43,920
every seven days

140
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,399
I'll give you the antidote once.

141
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
You should know,

142
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,399
when it comes to survival,

143
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,279
friendship is worthless.

144
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,760
It's just a pity

145
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,040
you missed one move.

146
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,920
Bewildering Powder.

147
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,679
This Bewildering Powder

148
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,079
was also in your own bag.

149
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,959
This is what you call reaping what you sow.

150
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,200
For me,

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
friendship is more important than living.

152
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,119
My family is already missing.

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
If I lose this friend too,

154
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,200
then living in this world

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,679
has no meaning.

156
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,320
Linlang.

157
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,519
Wait.

158
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,280
Why are you here?

159
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,719
I'm just worried about you.

160
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm not wanted by the authorities.

161
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,479
But you are.

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
Me?

163
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,599
My family works as coroners in the Outer Eight Trades.

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,479
We, the Outer Eight Trades drifting in the martial world,

165
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,960
all rely on our skills to make a living.

166
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,280
Others may look down on us,

167
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,080
but we can't look down on ourselves.

168
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,159
Forget it.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,760
Let's just do a losing deal this time.

170
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,039
Stop struggling.

171
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,919
I know you're strong.

172
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,719
The ropes tying you up are specially made by me.

173
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,799
Let her go.

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,719
If you have the guts,

175
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,919
come at me instead.

176
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Don't flatter yourself.

177
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,119
I only caught you by chance.

178
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,559
She's the one I want.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,080
Who are you, really?

180
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,440
I have no grudge against you.

181
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,679
No grudge at all.

182
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,640
Did you forget?

183
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,520
You killed my wife—I have a vendetta against you.

184
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,479
Xiaolian and I were just an ordinary couple.

185
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,719
But fate is unpredictable.

186
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,880
Our daughter suddenly fell seriously ill.

187
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,880
To pay for our daughter's treatment,

188
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,960
Xiaolian actually sold herself

189
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,440
to a pleasure boat.

190
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,799
Come again next time.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
Xiaoxiao is a good child.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,719
She often tells me

193
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,320
that when she grows up and earns money,

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,919
she'll bring her mother back.

195
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,799
So our family can live in peace.

196
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,239
Heaven is just so unfair.

197
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,960
That day, I got the news.

198
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,919
By the time I arrived,

199
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,640
I saw you taking her away.

200
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,479
It's over, it's over.

201
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,960
At that moment, I deeply regretted it.

202
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,119
If it weren't for you

203
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
she wouldn't have died at all.

204
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,400
Let her go.

205
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Let her go.

206
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,520
Get out of my way!

207
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,479
Lu Jiu

208
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,200
Are you okay?

209
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
So you can also experience

210
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,200
watching your loved one

211
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,359
die slowly right before your eyes.

212
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
He and I are not...

213
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
Are you or not?

214
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
I decide that.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,119
Before you arrived

216
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,039
Linlang wasn't allowed to perform the autopsy herself.

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I was the one who told the magistrate

218
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,679
to let her do the dissection.

219
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,559
It was all my doing.

220
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Kill me.

221
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,000
Father

222
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,200
Lu Jiu has already followed your plan

223
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,479
and set out for Wu Town.

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Lu Jiu

225
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,520
Lu Jiu

226
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,039
Dad

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,119
Brother, Sister

228
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,679
I know you are all good people.

229
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,479
Please, don't kill my dad.

230
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:23,719
Sir

231
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
Since we already know

232
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,760
the general escape route of Lu Jiu and the others,

233
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,080
why aren't we pursuing them?

234
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
Why are we returning to Luoyang instead?

235
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Sir

236
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,159
Are you even listening to me?

237
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,320
It was disrespectful of me.

238
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,520
But I was just anxious.

239
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,200
What are you anxious about?

240
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm afraid Lu Jiu and the others will escape.

241
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,440
Since you taught me last time,

242
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,159
I've studied the regulations of the Diancha Department

243
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,479
and now I understand them thoroughly.

244
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,080
The official in charge of investigating criminal cases

245
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,559
must first prepare the five hearings

246
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,280
and verify all evidence and testimonies

247
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,479
If the circumstances remain suspicious

248
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
and still cannot be confirmed

249
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,719
then interrogation may proceed

250
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,880
In plain terms

251
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
it means we have to capture Lu Jiu and the others first

252
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,960
so we can interrogate them again

253
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,200
and find out who is responsible for this case

254
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,679
If you follow the rules so strictly

255
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
and handle everything by procedure

256
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,799
I'm afraid you won't uncover anything

257
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,239
But the investigation regulations

258
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,640
are set by the court to regulate judicial officials

259
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,880
If no one follows them

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,599
wouldn't the world fall into chaos?

261
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:33,960
Then let me ask you

262
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,039
the male corpse from the Lu family

263
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,239
is it Lu Mingcheng?

264
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,799
No, it's not

265
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,640
Does Lu Jiu have a motive for murder?

266
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,719
No, he doesn't

267
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,799
Sir

268
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,239
then why did you take me

269
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,960
to investigate Lu Jiu's whereabouts?

270
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,760
Do you only want to know where he went

271
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
and never intended to arrest him?

272
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,719
Sir

273
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,320
Lu Jiu and the others

274
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,320
really did follow the route we planned

275
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,159
He

276
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,400
You

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,640
Sir

278
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,640
Didn't you say this matter

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,799
must not be known by a third party?

280
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,359
Alright.

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,520
I was wondering why Lu Jiu escaped from prison so easily.

282
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,320
Turns out you let him go on purpose.

283
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,239
And you even colluded with that corrupt official.

284
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,599
You'll understand in time.

285
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,880
I don't understand.

286
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,280
I admired you.

287
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,280
Because you were the greatest detective in the land.

288
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,559
Solving cases for the people.

289
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,039
But I never expected

290
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,159
you would turn out to be this kind of person.

291
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,359
Ignore her.

292
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,479
Report promptly.

293
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,039
Sir.

294
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,559
I have found out

295
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,840
the culprit of the pleasure boat case

296
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,200
is Jia Changyi, the lover of the music instructor.

297
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,280
He ambushed them halfway.

298
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,799
But by Lu Jiu's side

299
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,799
was that craftsman named Sima Kong protecting him.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,719
So

301
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,000
he was unharmed.

302
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,840
Investigate that person's background.

303
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes, sir.

304
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,440
I kept something in mind just in case.

305
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:10,280
I didn't reveal that Lu Jiu knows martial arts

306
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,960
to Geng Zhao.

307
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,679
You think you're clever.

308
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,440
You don't just take orders from Geng Zhao.

309
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,640
And you're not his only informant.

310
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,159
I admit my wrongdoing.

311
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,799
From this moment on,

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,679
you are not to take any further action.

313
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,320
I will give all the orders from now on.

314
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,719
It seems

315
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
it's time to activate

316
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,400
the underworld network.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,359
You want to contact

318
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
the Assassin Alliance?

319
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,520
I am skilled in painting.

320
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,799
I am willing to draw a portrait of Lu Jiu to atone for my mistake.

321
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,479
Slow down.

322
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,719
Come on, come on, watch your step.

323
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,039
Not taking it.

324
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,440
One hundred and fifteen Chiwen.

325
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,599
That's three times the usual price.

326
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,559
Don't you know my rules?

327
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:58,200
I never leave anyone alive.

328
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,039
The people traveling with him,

329
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,479
are yours to deal with.

330
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,439
It's been burning for a whole day and night.

331
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
And there's still no improvement.

332
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,400
Letting it drag on like this won't help.

333
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,319
We need to find some medicine.

334
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,880
When did you go?

335
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,199
There are wanted posters for you and Lu Jiu everywhere outside.

336
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,920
It's so dangerous for you to go out so recklessly.

337
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:29,719
Don't worry.

338
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,079
The wanted posters are fake.

339
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,599
Fake?

340
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,959
How do you know they're fake?

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,800
We're craftsmen.

342
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,760
We go from street to street.

343
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,959
Naturally, we're well-informed.

344
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,479
I suppose someone tipped you off.

345
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,719
If you have time to doubt me,

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,560
you'd be better off thinking about our current situation.

347
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,959
For example,

348
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,880
why are the wanted posters fake?

349
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,319
You mean,

350
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,560
someone deliberately lured us away from Luoyang County.

351
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,199
That's right.

352
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,040
Thinking about it carefully,

353
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,400
when we escaped from prison,

354
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,160
it was unusually easy, almost as if

355
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
someone behind the scenes made it happen on purpose.

356
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,599
The most urgent thing right now

357
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,239
is to heal him first.

358
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,079
Thank you for getting medicine for Lu Jiu.

359
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,400
I will pay you back.

360
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,560
How will you pay me back?

361
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,239
Lu Jiu said you’re foolish.

362
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,319
You really are foolish.

363
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,239
You actually gave away all your money

364
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,640
to Jia Changyi and his daughter.

365
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,640
Lu Jiu.

366
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,000
Lu Jiu.

367
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,719
No!

368
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,839
Lu Jiu, you’re awake!

369
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,599
Lin Lang.

370
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,199
Where is Jia Changyi?

371
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
He was let go by a certain fool.

372
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,839
And even gave away all their possessions

373
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,119
for someone else’s travel expenses.

374
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,719
Jia Changyi

375
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,520
is also a pitiful person.

376
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,000
Lin Lang did nothing wrong.

377
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Lu Jiu, how are you feeling?

378
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,719
This is what happens when you don’t listen to me

379
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,079
and insist on playing the hero.

380
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,359
Even poisoned, you still came back to save someone.

381
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,319
Utterly foolish.

382
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,599
Lu Jiu, you’ve been poisoned.

383
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
Why didn’t you tell me before?

384
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,319
I could have tried to help you detoxify.

385
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,400
I won’t die.

386
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,119
What are you laughing at?

387
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,479
I'm laughing because you two are both fools.

388
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
I still haven't settled accounts with you.

389
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,479
What accounts?

390
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,400
Someone has been tipping him off all along the way.

391
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,599
Last time, when I buried my father,

392
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,000
he was probably meeting with someone.

393
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:53,640
This time,

394
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,400
he already knew your wanted notice was fake.

395
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,599
But he didn't tell us.

396
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,119
Let me correct that.

397
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,959
I only just found out myself.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
The wanted notice is fake.

399
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,520
Besides,

400
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,000
hasn't he also been pretending not to know martial arts?

401
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,000
That's right, Lu Jiu.

402
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I really didn't lie to you.

403
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,800
I don't even remember what just happened.

404
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,479
It seems, Young Master Lu Jiu,

405
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,119
you still don't see us as your own people.

406
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,839
Everyone knows the Lu family is powerful and wealthy.

407
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,239
Maybe at home,

408
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,400
you have a famous master secretly teaching you.

409
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
I want to ask you,

410
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,359
you've been investigating all along—

411
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,359
what is your real purpose?

412
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,839
What have I, Sima Kong, done to deserve this?

413
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,880
To be hunted by Lian Bu Ci from the Assassin Alliance?

414
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,880
Assassin Alliance.

415
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,280
You are Lu Jiu.

416
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,199
You guys run first.

417
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,719
What about you?

418
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,959
They're after Lu Jiu.

419
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,119
Just take care of yourselves.

420
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,719
After all, you still owe me money.

421
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,760
Don't die.

422
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,680
Otherwise,

423
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,839
there won't be any money.

424
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,800
Sir, where are you going?

425
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:14,640
If you don't tell me,

426
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,160
I'll just have to follow and see for myself.

427
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,680
No.

428
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,599
We can't leave Sima Kong behind.

429
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,839
How can you save him in your current state?

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,319
Counting this time,

431
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,359
it's already the second time you've saved me.

432
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,719
I can't just ignore him.

433
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,439
Hide here.

434
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,560
I'll go distract those people.

435
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,520
No.

436
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
I can't let you go alone

437
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,680
and take the risk.

438
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,040
You're their target.

439
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,040
Even if they catch you, nothing will happen.

440
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,160
Linlang.

441
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,400
Linlang.

442
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
If I don't come back,

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,199
you're not allowed to forget me.

444
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
People from the Tang Clan

445
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,599
Do things for money

446
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
Why get involved in this mess

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,319
Right back at you

448
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,439
Reveal who hired you to kill Lu Jiu

449
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,079
And I might consider sparing your life

450
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,719
Let's see how long you can hold out

451
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,839
I'll deal with you later

452
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,479
You brat

453
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,680
How dare you mess with me

454
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,520
One time each

455
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,719
Now we're even

456
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,239
Are you okay

457
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm fine

458
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,319
You think we're even just like that

459
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,800
That's because you haven't seen my true strength

460
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
Wooden Axe Formation

461
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,040
What's the secret behind this

462
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,040
This is a formation created by Lu Ban

463
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,239
It's unpredictable

464
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,119
This Lian Buci

465
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,599
Actually uses such a sophisticated formation to kill

466
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,239
Even you can't break it

467
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,560
Didn't expect you to think so highly of me

468
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,520
Since that's the case

469
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,119
At worst, I'll take him down with me

470
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
Such excitement

471
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,599
How could

472
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,400
Lu Jiu possibly miss out

473
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,199
Didn't I tell you not to come

474
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,319
No way I would

475
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,199
Let you face him alone

476
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,000
Don't think you can get out of paying me this way

477
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,880
Originally

478
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,920
I wanted the three of you to keep each other company on the road to the afterlife

479
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,199
Unfortunately

480
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,439
The client

481
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,400
Insisted on keeping you alive

482
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,160
The other two

483
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,839
Are a different story

484
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,079
Who are you?

485
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,079
Geng Zhao from the Diancha Department.

486
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,959
So it's the famous detective Lord Geng.

487
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,400
But as far as I know,

488
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,079
this Lu Jiu

489
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,880
is a fugitive wanted for murder.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,119
I'm helping your government catch him.

491
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,640
There's no reason to stop me, right?

492
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,880
In the past few years,

493
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:24,920
for the Assassin Alliance,

494
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,359
you've killed dozens of people.

495
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,760
I was also working for the government.

496
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,199
At least I

497
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,880
am a respected member of the Assassin Alliance,

498
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,760
one of the top ten assassins.

499
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,599
You alone

500
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,599
think you can stop me?

501
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,800
Who said

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,119
I came alone?

503
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,760
This is bad.

504
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,000
Gentlemen,

505
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,280
spare me!

506
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:03,719
Have mercy!

507
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,760
Please, have mercy!

508
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,000
Why are you here?

509
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,160
I, a dignified princess, was excluded from the operation.

510
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,359
Of course I had to come and see for myself.

511
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,119
Come with me.

512
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,119
Lu Jiu and the others are over there.

513
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,800
I think I was just here.

514
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
It's toxic miasma.

515
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,239
Linlang!

516
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:41,839
Quick, get the medicine!

517
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,119
Hurry, bring the medicine, quick!

518
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,560
Why didn't you take out the medicine earlier?

519
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,880
I was just running for my life.

520
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,920
Thanks to your medicine,

521
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,760
I'm feeling much better now.

522
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,839
You still have this?

523
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,680
Give it back to me.

524
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,239
It's such an important item.

525
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,479
You're injured now.

526
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,000
Let me keep it safe for you.

527
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,119
Now you don't think my medicine

528
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,359
is only used to harm people, right?

529
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,640
Stop talking so much.

530
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,160
Let's hurry and escape.

531
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,719
Go.

532
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:20,479
Go.

533
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,800
Young Master Sima,

534
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,000
Are you alright?

535
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,199
I'm fine.

536
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
Then go get some water for Young Master Sima.

537
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,920
I'll take care of his wound.

538
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,640
No need.

539
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,880
I know medicine myself.

540
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:03,920
Young Master Sima,

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,199
A healer can't treat himself.

542
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Let me help you check it.

543
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,400
Wait.

544
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,800
I'll do it.

545
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Be gentle.

546
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,640
He's injured.

547
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,719
Be gentle.

548
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
Be gentle.

549
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,800
Hold this.

550
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,680
Done.

551
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
Done.

552
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,040
The bandaging is pretty good.

553
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,599
Although the external wound has been treated,

554
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,400
I still need to check your bones.

555
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,880
Let's check if there are any internal injuries.

556
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,800
Bite down on this.

557
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,680
I've experienced her strength before.

558
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,719
I, Sima Kong,

559
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,160
have never known what pain is.

560
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,839
Sorry, Young Master Sima.

561
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm usually examining corpses.

562
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,760
Young Master Sima,

563
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,800
please bear with it a little longer.

564
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
I'll help you set it back in place.

565
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,000
