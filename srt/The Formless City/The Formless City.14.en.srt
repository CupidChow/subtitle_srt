1
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,039
Go.

2
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,800
Let's go, right here.

3
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,320
Come out.

4
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,559
You found me.

5
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,199
You've been hiding behind me for ages.

6
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,520
How could I not notice?

7
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,119
You should've told me you saw me earlier.

8
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,600
You made me hide so hard.

9
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,600
Didn't you say

10
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,119
today was Xu Linlang's trap?

11
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,880
What's wrong?

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,919
Changed your mind?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Who changed their mind?

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm just afraid you'll get tricked again.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
No one will clean up after you.

16
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,919
I have no family or friends.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,720
Even if I die,

18
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,279
no one will mourn me, no need to clean up.

19
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,720
I won't let you say things like that.

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,440
Let's get to work quickly.

21
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,559
Why are so many people locked up here?

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,039
Hurry and find Sima Kong.

23
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,080
Time is running out.

24
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,039
Go.

25
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,960
Found him.

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,119
Sima Kong.

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
Sima Kong.

28
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,000
No wonder there's no one guarding him.

29
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,639
He can't possibly escape in this condition.

30
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,080
What exactly happened to him?

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
With his personality,

32
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,399
he'd rather die than let us see him like this.

33
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,119
Hurry.

34
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Sima Kong.

35
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,600
Sima Kong.

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,839
Sima Kong.

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,039
Sima Kong... Sister.

38
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,880
Sister, please save me.

39
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm scared.

40
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,440
Don't be afraid.

41
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,800
We're here to rescue you.

42
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,839
Someone's coming. We have to go.

43
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,639
We can't leave him here alone.

44
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,279
We can't fight our way out.

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,199
We need to use our wits.

46
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,119
Don't worry.

47
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,639
We will definitely save you.

48
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,800
Wait here for us.

49
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,600
We have to go.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,160
Let's go.

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,119
Sister, don't go.

52
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

53
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,720
Thank you all for waiting.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
This slave auction

55
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,119
will now begin.

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,440
Bring them in!

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Bring out the goods.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Everyone has come prepared this time.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
Take a look at this batch.

60
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,760
Each one is better than the last.

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,799
Will this plan work?

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,239
The slaves this time

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Judging by the number they've detained

64
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,600
and the buyers' appearance,

65
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,200
this is a large-scale operation.

66
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,359
We're outnumbered.

67
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,320
We have no choice but to take a risk.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Don't worry.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
In similar situations,

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
I've followed the boss

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
a few times before.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,799
Come here.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
This is our first

74
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,519
slave for sale today.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,200
What is this?

76
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,040
Don't underestimate him.

77
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,600
His value

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,239
isn't in his limbs,

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,119
but in his mind.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,279
The martial arts secrets of all the major sects

81
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,959
and their manuals

82
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,000
are all stored in his head.

83
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,320
I'll take this one.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,959
Thank you for your support, sir.

85
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,480
But I haven't even given the starting price yet.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,519
No matter the price, I want it.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,079
No, no, don't listen to him.

88
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:27,640
Two hundred taels.

89
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,920
Two hundred taels.

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Two hundred and ten taels.

91
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
Two hundred and ten taels.

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
Aren't we here to save Sima Kong?

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,799
How is this saving him? Is there more?

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,679
Let me tell you,

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,799
It's already two hundred and ten taels.

96
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,720
I understand merchants' minds best.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
They get nervous when facing a richer opponent.

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,239
Let them see

99
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,320
what it means to be determined to win.

100
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,880
But we don't have any money at all.

101
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,920
You don't actually think I'll pay them, do you?

102
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,480
Are you just trying to compete?

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Say two hundred and sixty taels.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,760
Two hundred and eighty taels.

105
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,880
Three hundred taels.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,239
Th-this...

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Th-this... three hundred taels!

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,600
Anyone else want to bid higher?

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,239
No matter how much anyone offers,

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll always add one more increment.

111
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,880
Always add one more.

112
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:06,799
Um...

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Young master, you are indeed generous.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
However,

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,119
Although I'm a businessman,

116
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,279
and I care about profit,

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,079
but you're spending three hundred taels on an old man,

118
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,160
who doesn't have many years left.

119
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,839
I feel like you're the one losing out.

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,679
Sorry about that.

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
Weren't you the one who said that?

122
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,600
The valuable thing is the brain.

123
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,160
The limbs aren't good.

124
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,920
Then just get me another strong one.

125
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,480
Mm.

126
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,600
The ones on stage won't do.

127
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,760
None of them catch my eye.

128
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,839
Please, sir.

129
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,760
Take whichever one you like.

130
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,559
That's easy.

131
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,320
This one.

132
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,839
What do you think of this one?

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,679
This one.

134
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,000
Not really.

135
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,959
This one.

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,239
This one's young, this one.

137
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Too skinny.

138
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,200
Scrawny.

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,679
Doesn't appeal to me.

140
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,480
Doesn't appeal to me.

141
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,000
Are there any more?

142
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,839
Yes, yes, yes.

143
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Yes.

144
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
Come, please come inside.

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,359
Sir.

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
The young lady is currently

147
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,640
in Mist Town.

148
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,160
I've already sent people to protect her in secret.

149
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,839
She deliberately hid this trip from me.

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,480
So why should I protect her?

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,480
But she...

152
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,920
She's still your biological daughter.

153
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,320
Only those who can serve Tianluo

154
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,200
deserve a place here.

155
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,079
Feiying is the husband she chose.

156
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,480
She should be the one to bring him back.

157
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,200
Young master,

158
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,799
you've been choosing for half the day.

159
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,119
Isn't it just a slave?

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,359
Just grab any one.

161
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,559
Sister,

162
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,239
Sister,

163
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,799
please, help me get out of here.

164
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:57,920
Go back.

165
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,640
This guy is tall and skinny.

166
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,040
He doesn't look very capable.

167
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,679
But he has a sweet tongue.

168
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,399
He can make my lady happy.

169
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,200
Not bad.

170
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,119
Let's take him.

171
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,679
That old man Dugu

172
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,440
actually wants to use his daughter's engagement

173
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,760
to tie Fei Ying down.

174
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,119
He's dreaming.

175
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Now that Ye Mei has set his sights on Fei Ying,

176
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,200
shouldn't we take precautions early?

177
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,559
Bring him back.

178
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,359
I went to great lengths to lure him here

179
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,760
to awaken his memories sealed for seven years.

180
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
If I wanted to capture him,

181
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,280
why would I have kept him for so long?

182
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,039
How could I... Father, please calm your anger.

183
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,799
Forgive me for not thinking it through.

184
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,960
How did we end up raising such a useless person?

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,039
Young Master Xu, please.

186
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,280
If your Xu family from Gushan weren't such a prestigious clan,

187
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,080
I would never have let you get a two-for-one deal.

188
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,760
Will he also be a friend of our Gushan in the future?

189
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,039
Thank you, Young Master Xu.

190
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,359
Sister, they're coming to take me.

191
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,559
Young Master Xu, this...

192
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,640
This is

193
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,200
the guard who watches over our house.

194
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,239
He came to pick me up.

195
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,320
It seems Young Master Xu is indeed

196
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,719
very busy.

197
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,119
How about this,

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
you go ahead and take care of your business,

199
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,719
and leave these small matters to me.

200
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,000
These two slaves

201
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,679
can stay with me for now.

202
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
When you're done,

203
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,159
you can come and get them anytime.

204
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,559
If you don't have time,

205
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,520
I can also

206
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,760
send them to your residence.

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,520
What do you think?

208
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,599
Then I'll trouble you with that.

209
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,799
It's my duty.

210
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,080
It's my duty.

211
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,880
Sister,

212
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,440
Young Master Lu really has a lot of influence.

213
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,479
He can even get people from the Inspection Bureau to guard you.

214
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,119
You could have spoken louder,

215
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,559
and made sure everyone here

216
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
couldn't leave.

217
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
You found the thieves' den.

218
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
There are far more people who were kidnapped than we imagined.

219
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,520
It shows that this group has been doing this

220
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,919
for quite some time.

221
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,919
They treat human lives as worthless.

222
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,799
Even our friends

223
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,119
have been harmed.

224
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,000
I will handle the case in Mist Town myself.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,239
But before that,

226
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,559
please come back with me

227
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,880
and explain the other case clearly.

228
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,200
Master Geng

229
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
If you came here

230
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,760
to capture Tianluo's top assassin, Fei Ying,

231
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm willing to go back with you.

232
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,039
I didn't expect

233
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
you would admit it so readily.

234
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,640
The truth will come out sooner or later.

235
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,640
If

236
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
I had confessed everything earlier,

237
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,960
there wouldn't be such misunderstandings today.

238
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,520
I lost my memory before.

239
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,760
I only learned about this identity recently.

240
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,280
I can go back with you.

241
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,719
The only condition

242
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,039
is to guarantee the safety of Linlang and Sima Kong.

243
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,919
I won't let you leave.

244
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,559
There's something wrong with these people.

245
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,719
Catch him!

246
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,679
Hurry, hurry!

247
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,440
Sister, help me!

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
Sister, help me!

249
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,039
Retreat!

250
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,919
Linlang

251
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,719
Bai Yu

252
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,280
Bai Yu, what's wrong?

253
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,440
Are you okay?

254
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Sir, I'm fine.

255
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,280
How many times have I told you

256
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,000
Girls shouldn't always rush into things.

257
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,880
You don't even know what Lu Jiu just scattered.

258
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,440
Oh, just ignore them.

259
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,200
As long as Lord Geng is fine.

260
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,520
What's wrong with you?

261
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,359
I don't know why either.

262
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,080
I feel so hot.

263
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,039
It's cooler over here.

264
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,159
Let's go.

265
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,640
Let's go.

266
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,760
Be careful.

267
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,599
No one's here.

268
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,159
I'm so hot.

269
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
Hot.

270
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Maybe just now,

271
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,119
among the medicinal powders I grabbed,

272
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,799
one was from the Western Regions.

273
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I don't really know about it.

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
I haven't figured out its ingredients.

275
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,799
Let's take a break.

276
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,919
Okay.

277
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,320
Then let's rest.

278
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,599
No, no, what are you doing?

279
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,520
Didn't you say you wanted to rest?

280
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,599
Rest in bed.

281
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,039
Of course I have to take off my clothes.

282
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,440
No.

283
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,559
Why would you get in bed out here in the wilderness?

284
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,599
Just stay as you are.

285
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,599
Keep your clothes on.

286
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,200
Right.

287
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,159
This isn't home.

288
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,440
But fortunately,

289
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,000
I have you by my side.

290
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,359
I have you by my side.

291
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,559
That's really nice.

292
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,760
Do you really think

293
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,559
that having me by your side

294
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,200
is a good thing?

295
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,119
Of course.

296
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,200
Not only do I think it's good to have you by my side,

297
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,039
I also like you.

298
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,919
Linlang, what are you doing?

299
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,400
What do you think I'm doing?

300
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,799
Linlang.

301
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,239
I don't consider myself a particularly noble person,

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,039
but

303
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,760
I can't take advantage of someone in a vulnerable state.

304
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,799
Besides, my identity...

305
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,520
We can do this in the future

306
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,799
when the time is right.

307
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

308
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Linlang.

309
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,479
We can't be like this.

310
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Lu Jiu.

311
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,400
What are you doing?

312
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,799
I...

313
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,479
Weren't we just in the human traffickers' hideout?

314
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,760
How did we end up here?

315
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:28,840
You...

316
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Do you remember what just happened?

317
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,119
You don't remember anything?

318
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
Did something special happen?

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,239
It's fine.

320
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,080
I don't want to be with you in a muddled, unclear way either.

321
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,719
What are you even talking about?

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,960
It's nothing.

323
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:44,960
I mean,

324
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,440
our identities have been exposed now.

325
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,400
They still don't know how to deal with Sima Kong.

326
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,599
Are you going to talk or not?

327
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,919
Are you going to talk or not?

328
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,760
Still stubborn, huh?

329
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,359
Are you going to talk or not?

330
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Sister.

331
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,000
Go ahead, speak.

332
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
Your companions—

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,479
Where exactly are they?

334
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,559
I don't know.

335
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,159
I don't know.

336
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,359
I thought you had potential to be a good apothecary.

337
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,840
Never expected to catch a troublemaker.

338
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,400
Do it.

339
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,320
Master.

340
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,760
It would be a waste to kill him.

341
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,280
I once found something on his clothes.

342
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,080
Maybe it can be used as bait.

343
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,880
It might make him remember something useful.

344
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,479
Once we find his accomplices,

345
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
we can catch them all at once.

346
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,359
Hmm.

347
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,159
Then let him live for now.

348
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,080
After we catch the others,

349
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,559
kill them all.

350
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,239
To vent my anger.

351
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,359
Why aren't you afraid of me?

352
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,799
Your eyes,

353
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,239
are just like that other sister's eyes.

354
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,400
You're a good person.

355
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,239
You won't hurt me.

356
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm not a good person.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,280
Do you recognize this item?

358
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,119
That's mine.

359
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,080
Give it back to me.

360
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,239
That's mine.

361
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,679
It seems this sachet

362
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
is very important to you.

363
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:27,919
Linlang.

364
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,119
Linlang.

365
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,320
Give it back to me.

366
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,599
Linlang.

367
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,320
Xu Linlang.

368
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,760
A person listed on the Assassin Alliance's roster.

369
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
Sister, please give it back to me.

370
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,039
Sister.

371
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,440
Give it back to me.

372
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,679
Give it back to me.

373
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,359
Just this shabby sachet.

374
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,559
The person who saved him

375
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,080
also used scented powder to confuse everyone and escaped in the chaos.

376
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,520
Maybe we can find clues in the sachet.

377
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,960
Hmm.

378
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,320
Such a small matter

379
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,199
I'll leave it to you to handle.

380
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,079
Okay.

381
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:05,920
By the way,

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,439
Miss Hua is our main employer.

383
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,119
These days,

384
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,719
we must not make any mistakes.

385
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,560
I understand.

386
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,719
It's just that

387
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,160
the people at Gushan have started asking about the medicine men.

388
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,280
I'm afraid the laundry woman

389
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,959
has already started to suspect us.

390
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
You should know

391
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,079
why I keep you around.

392
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
If you can't even handle such a small matter,

393
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,640
if you mess this up,

394
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:38,239
then don't even think about seeing your brother again.

395
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,760
I understand.

396
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,199
I will definitely take care of this for you.

397
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,400
I won't let you worry.

398
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,359
You may go.

399
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

400
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,119
Brother,

401
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,560
don't worry.

402
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,119
Sister

403
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,479
will definitely rescue you from those evil people.

404
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,439
The fact that I am Fei Ying

405
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,040
doesn't bother you?

406
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
Although it was Tian Luo who killed my father,

407
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,839
you were once one of them too.

408
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
But in these seven years,

409
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,520
you've already left them behind.

410
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,479
In my eyes,

411
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
you are Lu Jiu.

412
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,560
Not Fei Ying.

413
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,880
You really don't mind?

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,239
It's like how none of us can choose

415
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,959
where we are born.

416
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,439
Now that you have a chance

417
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,839
to choose again,

418
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,280
you must live the life you truly want.

419
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,760
Lin Lang.

420
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,760
What are you thinking about?

421
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,479
Nothing.

422
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:09,959
Really.

423
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,079
Really.

424
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,560
Lu Jiu.

425
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,199
Are you hiding something from me again?

426
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm really not hiding anything from you.

427
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,640
If I were hiding something from you,

428
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,000
may I be struck by lightning.

429
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,680
Why are you making such a serious vow for no reason?

430
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,680
Looking at you two,

431
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,199
you seem like newlyweds.

432
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,760
I have all kinds of jewelry here.

433
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,000
Everything you could want.

434
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,880
Pick some to give to your wife.

435
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

436
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,520
We're not a married couple.

437
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,880
Why are you laughing?

438
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,359
I...

439
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,920
just think

440
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,959
it's been a long time since we've

441
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,239
strolled around so leisurely.

442
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,599
Like we used to.

443
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
It's really nice.

444
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
And you say you're not a couple.

445
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,920
Look how lovey-dovey you are.

446
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Even if you're not married,

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,239
you must be engaged, right?

448
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Engaged? What are you talking about?

449
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,959
There's nothing like that at all.

450
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,239
You're just one step away from admitting it.

451
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Here I have

452
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,359
some exotic perfumes.

453
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,680
If you buy them,

454
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,439
your whole room will be filled with fragrance.

455
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,400
It'll make you feel like you're in a dream.

456
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,680
Perfume?

457
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,599
I like you even more.

458
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:23,839
Miss

459
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,680
Linlang, do you want it or not?

460
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,000
Linlang

461
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,280
You don't need to be shy.

462
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
Last night

463
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,959
What happened last night wasn't your fault.

464
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,319
Actually, I...

465
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,479
Linlang

466
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,640
Are you okay?

467
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't be so nervous.

468
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm fine.

469
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,040
Didn't you see all my goods are ruined?

470
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,599
And you still have the nerve to ask if I'm okay?

471
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
Sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going.

472
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,280
Not watching the road?

473
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,760
Are your eyes just for decoration?

474
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,680
Why are you being so aggressive?

475
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,520
How much is this worth?

476
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,880
I'll compensate you, okay?

477
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Enough.

478
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Miss Xing'er

479
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
This young lady made an honest mistake as well.

480
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,280
It's just that the weather has been dry lately.

481
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,560
There's some loose dust on the ground.

482
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,199
Just cut off the dirtiest part.

483
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,640
It won't affect our ability to sell it.

484
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,479
Yes.

485
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,040
Thank you for helping us out, miss.

486
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,359
But it truly was my fault today.

487
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,520
This isn't much money,

488
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,119
but it's a token of my sincerity.

489
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,839
It's just a small matter, no need to worry.

490
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,199
My father taught me from a young age

491
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,040
to take responsibility for my own actions.

492
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,640
Please accept it.

493
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,719
Linlang.

494
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,839
Since Miss Xing'er won't accept it,

495
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
if you force it on her,

496
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,400
it will seem like you're just seeking praise.

497
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,359
How about this instead?

498
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,920
Let's go inside and buy something.

499
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,640
This way,

500
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,800
Miss Xing'er can accept the money with peace of mind.

501
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:43,280
Let's go.

502
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,160
Go ahead.

503
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,760
Do you have a new plan?

504
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,680
You really know me.

505
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,079
Ever since you walked in,

506
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,000
you've been watching that Miss Xing.

507
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,880
You must have noticed something wrong with her.

508
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
Maybe.

509
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,640
Maybe I was just attracted to her beauty.

510
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,119
You're not that kind of person.

511
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
True.

512
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,040
Last night, there was a

513
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,800
beautiful woman

514
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,599
who had improper thoughts about me.

515
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,079
Luckily, I restrained myself.

516
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,520
Seems like I really am

517
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,280
a gentleman. Still bringing this up?

518
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Alright, let's get serious.

519
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
I noticed on her

520
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,959
the scent of Sima Kong's sachet.

521
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,319
You mean

522
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,680
she's with those people?

523
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,680
It's possible.

524
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
Also,

525
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,839
when that silk fell to the ground just now,

526
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,040
she actually told the waiter to just cut it as it was.

527
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,520
That's not something a merchant would do.

528
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,359
The people from the temple just took some fabric from here.

529
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,000
So,

530
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:52,280
this silk shop and the temple

531
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,479
are both places where they exchange information.

532
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,880
Have you two made your choice?

533
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,640
All the fabrics here are so beautiful.

534
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,719
Why don't you recommend one for me?

535
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,119
This young lady has a spirited look.

536
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,040
Complicated patterns don't suit you.

537
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
But this one

538
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,160
is simple and neat, yet still charming.

539
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,160
It really suits you.

540
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,599
You run such a large silk shop,

541
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,160
why do you still do the embroidery yourself?

542
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,680
Your hands are covered in calluses.

543
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,680
I come from a humble background too.

544
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,640
I built this shop stitch by stitch.

545
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,560
Of course, I save wherever I can.

546
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,079
Calluses from sewing

547
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,680
should be on the fingertips.

548
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,280
But your calluses

549
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
are on the base of your thumb.

550
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,239
That looks more like they're from years of using a whip.

551
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,760
This shop is really strange.

552
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,479
Why is it closed and not doing business in broad daylight?

553
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,000
A few days later,

554
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,520
Trying to find another excuse to wander around.

555
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,719
Sir,

556
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,439
You know too much.

557
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,319
I won't let you leave here alive.

558
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,079
You won't.

559
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,239
Just before I came in,

560
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,479
at the entrance of the silk shop,

561
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,839
I saw fresh water and food left for stray cats.

562
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,760
If you're going to put on an act, do it thoroughly.

563
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
A silk shop like this

564
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,880
only attracts

565
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,959
the wealthy and powerful.

566
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
They hate stray cats and dogs the most.

567
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,520
Yet you take them in.

568
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
Besides, at the entrance,

569
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,959
you acted generously.

570
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,439
It's clear you're not a bad person.

571
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,040
Do you think I'll let you go just because of that?

572
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,520
A person's posture is shaped by their environment.

573
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,239
Even though you're dressed in fine clothes,

574
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,800
your spine leans forward.

575
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,040
It shows you often bow and bend over.

576
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
You are under someone's control.

577
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,040
Who exactly are you people?

578
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,439
Who we are doesn't matter.

579
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,239
What matters is letting those innocent people

580
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,040
regain their freedom

581
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,160
and reunite with their families.

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,839
Oh no.

583
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,280
I won't kill you this time.

584
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,000
But don't let me see you again.

585
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,959
Everyone has their own fate.

586
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,400
This is their destiny.

587
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,760
Don't meddle in other people's business.

588
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,839
But...

589
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,079
They went out that way.

590
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,000
Chase them.

591
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:06,880
Go after them.

592
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,040
She let us go just like that.

593
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,520
Could there be any danger?

594
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,640
Probably not.

595
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,439
Judging by her demeanor, her status isn't low.

596
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
She'll naturally have a way to handle it.

597
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,920
It's just that...

598
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,880
Our intention to rescue someone is too obvious now.

599
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,880
We need to find a way to act quickly.

600
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,599
I've got it.

601
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
This silk shop is just like the temple.

602
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,119
They're both places where information is exchanged.

603
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,920
As long as we find someone connected to both places,

604
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,119
someone who has contact with both,

605
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,520
we can find a breakthrough.

606
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Let's go.

607
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
You're very lucky.

608
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,239
Someone can come to save you.

609
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,920
But who can come to save me?

610
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,400
Found her.

611
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,000
Master.

612
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,839
Xing'er has been acting very strange lately.

613
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,479
You can't let your guard down.

614
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,359
Hmm.

615
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,079
Just keep a close eye on her.

616
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,719
She doesn't have any household registration papers.

617
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,439
She can't escape Mist Town.

618
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,119
Besides,

619
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,920
she still thinks her younger brother

620
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,000
is in my hands.

621
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,079
She would never dare betray me.

622
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,239
Master, you are wise.

623
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,079
She would never even dream

624
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,560
that brat

625
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,640
actually, years ago

626
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,680
fell ill

627
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
and died.

628
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,800
If she really notices anything unusual,

629
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,199
you'll take her place.

630
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,359
Thank you, Master.

631
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,319
About Xing'er...

632
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,040
That girl Xing'er,

633
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,239
she's still got some looks.

634
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,520
Sell her to the brothel.

635
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,199
Maybe we can get a good price.

636
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Master, I've followed you for so many years,

637
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,319
but I've never tasted a woman.

638
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,359
Before selling Xing'er to the brothel,

639
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,640
could I...

640
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,839
How dare you!

641
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,079
Spare me, Master!

642
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,359
Don't be afraid.

643
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,680
Giving her to you

644
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,760
isn't out of the question.

645
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,880
Thank you, Master.

646
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,520
Master, you've been hit by a dart!

647
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,920
Master! Master, this...

648
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,439
What should we do?

649
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,719
You two

650
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,000
Who are you?

651
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,680
You saved us.

652
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,800
Come with me.

653
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,640
Miss Xu has already made all the arrangements.

654
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,839
Over at the temple

655
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
there's still no news.

656
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,800
We made it through today safely.

657
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,839
Thanks to you.

658
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,959
It's just my duty.

659
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,760
Young Master hates anything wrinkled the most.

660
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,199
Sima Kong is such a clean person.

661
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,479
Now

662
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,199
he's locked up in that place.

663
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,800
It's really hard for him.

664
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
If only he had listened to me earlier,

665
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,680
he wouldn't be in this situation now.

666
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,839
It's only been a few days since Sima Kong was captured.

667
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,040
Linlang and I

668
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,719
haven't told anyone yet.

669
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,359
But you were able to come and rescue him right away.

670
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,640
Who exactly are you?

671
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,719
Does this have anything to do with you saving him?

672
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:03,959
Indeed.

673
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,000
I don't care what his status is.

674
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,800
Right now,

675
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,839
he is my friend.

676
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,319
So I will risk my life to save him.

677
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,439
It seems my young master truly has good judgment.

678
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,880
I was the one who judged with a petty mind,

679
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,479
doubting a gentleman's intentions.

680
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,239
I can tell

681
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,520
you treat him very well.

682
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,719
You two are friends as well, aren't you?

683
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,760
How could I dare call myself the young master's friend?

684
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,199
I'm just his servant.

685
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,280
Though the young master seems distant on the surface,

686
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,839
he is actually kind-hearted.

687
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,000
All these years,

688
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,640
he has never treated me harshly.

689
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,439
I'm simply repaying his kindness.

690
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,719
By the way,

691
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,479
about that plan—

692
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,959
is it actually feasible?

693
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,800
According to the information I received,

694
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,599
the one coming for the deal tomorrow

695
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,280
is the wealthy Shanxi merchant

696
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,079
Hua Jinshen's eldest daughter.

697
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Miss Hua.

698
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,839
No one has ever seen her true face.

699
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,719
I've had my people intercept them.

700
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,839
Those thieves

701
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,199
shouldn't notice.

702
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
That's true,

703
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,079
but

704
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,079
having Linlang pretend to be a noble lady

705
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,920
is indeed a bit difficult for her.

706
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,520
Who says it's difficult for me?

707
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,839
Look.
