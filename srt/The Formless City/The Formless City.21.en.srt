1
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,680
The things we've experienced

2
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,279
The people in our hearts

3
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,160
will only hide in the corners of our hearts

4
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,759
and will never disappear without a trace

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,399
If you can wait for Fei Ying to return

6
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,240
then I can wait for Lu Jiu to come back

7
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,520
What are you doing?

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Miss

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
We were sent by the city lord

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,520
I don't care who sent you

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,479
All of you, get out

12
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,679
Yes, yes

13
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,279
Let's go

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Get out!

15
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,440
Fei Ying

16
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,039
Are you okay?

17
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,759
I'm fine.

18
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:45,960
Senior Sister

19
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,080
You're still so impulsive.

20
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,119
They're just following orders.

21
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,399
If that's the case,

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
how will you explain this to your foster father?

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,000
I saw you suffering.

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
I can't worry about all that.

25
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,559
They're only acting on orders.

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,960
Using the excuse of treating my headache,

27
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,240
they just wanted me to regain my memory.

28
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,639
The things we've experienced,

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
the people in our hearts,

30
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,320
will only hide in the corners of our hearts.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,000
They will never disappear without a trace.

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
What memories?

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,119
I can't remember clearly.

34
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,639
It's like dreaming.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,199
After waking up,

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,039
I forget everything.

37
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,559
Are these memories really that important?

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Even though I've remembered who I am,

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,919
the most important thing

40
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,199
is after the Tianchi cemetery,

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,960
how I got to Mist Town,

42
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,679
I can't remember any of it.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,639
Maybe

44
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,000
it's related to the Wuxiang Treasure.

45
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,160
So that's what you meant.

46
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,000
What else could you be talking about?

47
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,000
No.

48
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,240
Nothing.

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Clues to the treasure.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
Even though you can't remember,

51
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,399
but

52
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,960
Luo Linlang is in our hands now.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
Don't be fooled by how stubborn she is now.

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,679
Even with torture, she won't talk.

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,119
But

56
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,720
I doubt she can hold out for more than a few days.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
You tortured her?

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
Such a trivial matter

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,839
naturally doesn't require me to do it myself.

60
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,000
Fei Ying.

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,239
You care about her.

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,079
I was the one who captured her.

63
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,359
Of course I care about her.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,119
Whether she gives up useful information

65
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,079
Otherwise,

66
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,040
how could I answer to Tian Luo?

67
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,000
Master Geng

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,920
There is no longer a Master Geng in this world.

69
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,920
Only Geng Zhao remains.

70
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,320
I heard earlier that Bai Yu was imprisoned in the Tianluo prison.

71
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,239
She is to be executed soon.

72
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,799
I was planning to rescue her as well.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,679
I just didn't expect

74
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,160
that you would resort to breaking into the prison too.

75
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,040
To deal with those petty Tianluo scoundrels,

76
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,279
we must use their own methods

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
against them.

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,480
Alright.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,119
I have no martial arts skills now.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
Only my craft to rely on.

81
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,200
Master Geng

82
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,760
can lend me a helping hand.

83
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,640
Will this really work?

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,799
Trust me.

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,679
Something's wrong!

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,079
People from Gushan

87
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:41,920
are attacking the main gate.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,959
Many of our men are injured.

89
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,119
Master Dugu said you should hurry and reinforce them.

90
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,600
Go!

91
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes, yes!

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,839
Let's go, let's go!

93
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,440
Sorry for troubling you, Master Geng.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,760
Who taught you such a cunning trick?

95
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,200
Someone who has already cut ties with me.

96
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,600
What are you doing? Move!

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,640
Lu Jiu has escaped from prison.

98
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,160
Someone who cut ties with me.

99
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,320
Why are you here?

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,760
With Lord Geng's help,

101
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,320
getting into this prison was a breeze.

102
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,600
You see, the power of a hero saving a damsel in distress

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
is truly impressive.

104
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,239
It even made the law-abiding Lord Geng

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
break into prison.

106
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,440
Thank you.

107
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,600
You went to so much trouble to save me.

108
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,720
Between you and me,

109
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,079
is there any need to be so polite?

110
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,040
What about Linlang?

111
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,839
I've tried to find out over the past few days,

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,079
but I'm the only female prisoner here.

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
No one has seen Linlang.

114
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
To save Bai Yu,

115
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,679
these past few days,

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
I've been keeping watch near Tianluo.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,799
I haven't seen them take anyone out.

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,839
I understand.

119
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,000
The cell where Linlang is being held

120
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,959
was built using the Tang Clan's tomb construction techniques.

121
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,640
It should be hidden beneath the stone wall.

122
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
The Tang Clan is colluding with Tianluo.

123
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,600
It's entirely possible that the Tang Clan built the important cells.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,760
You studied under the Tang Clan.

125
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,920
Do you know how to unlock the secret chamber?

126
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,519
There are thousands of possible combinations for the entrance.

127
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,119
Only the builders know them.

128
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,399
I have an idea.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,239
Miss, Miss!

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,679
Why aren't you guarding the main prison?

131
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,799
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,000
Reporting to you, Miss.

133
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,959
Someone just said

134
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,920
that someone broke in.

135
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,959
They told us to come and reinforce.

136
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:18,920
This is bad.

137
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,080
Keep a close watch on Luo Linlang.

138
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,280
Yes, yes.

139
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,400
After them!

140
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,520
Lu Jiu!

141
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,119
How many times have I told you?

142
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm not Lu Jiu.

143
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,919
Linlang has saved you more than once.

144
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,919
Now she's been captured by you and is suffering in Tianluo.

145
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,559
Where is your conscience?

146
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,359
He wants to let us go.

147
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,719
Could it be a trick?

148
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,159
I said I'd let you go.

149
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,000
And I will keep my word.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,679
Didn't you say she saved me?

151
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,200
Then this is my way of repaying her.

152
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Don't let me see you again.

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,520
Otherwise,

154
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,479
I won't show mercy next time.

155
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,039
No matter if you are Fei Ying

156
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,239
or Lu Jiu

157
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,479
at this moment

158
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,559
I have a question I want to ask you

159
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,159
Is there a place for me in your heart?

160
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,239
No

161
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,320
He really said that?

162
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,239
Yes

163
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,359
Fei Ying requests an audience

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,559
Foster father

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
It's been a long time

166
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,599
Seeing elder brother

167
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,080
Why didn't you greet him?

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Your father

169
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,039
suddenly fell ill and passed away

170
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,359
From now on, the search for the treasure

171
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,760
will depend on you two brothers

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,159
You must work together to assist me

173
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,760
Congratulations, elder brother

174
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,239
for relying on your own intelligence

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
to take father's place

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
and continue to serve Tianluo

177
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,200
Although father is gone

178
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,799
however he treated you before

179
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,440
elder brother will treat you the same from now on

180
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:00,960
Fei Ying

181
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,159
What brings you here?

182
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,559
Fei Ying released Luo Linlang without permission

183
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,880
I ask foster father to punish him

184
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,239
Get up

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,119
Tell me your reason

186
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,640
I haven't recalled my memories from seven years ago

187
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,080
So, on Luo Linlang

188
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,359
I'm searching for clues to the treasure

189
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,119
Since she won't talk under torture

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,479
It's better to use bait

191
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,919
and wait for the fish to bite

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,640
You used to be decisive in killing

193
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,200
and ruthless in your actions

194
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,520
When did you start

195
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,960
having such cunning

196
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,520
My adoptive father and my father

197
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,960
once used a trick

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,359
to lure me to Mist Town and help me recover my memory

199
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,479
Fei Ying

200
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,799
I'm just imitating them

201
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,760
Hmm

202
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,119
Alright

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,799
You truly are my good disciple

204
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,200
If you succeed in this matter

205
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,359
I will reward you handsomely

206
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,599
You may leave

207
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,919
Yes, adoptive father

208
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,239
Lord Dugu

209
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,159
This ungrateful wretch

210
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,440
kept by your side

211
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,039
will eventually be a disaster

212
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,320
just like your father

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,400
Isn't that right?

214
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I am completely loyal to you, my lord

215
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,400
That's why I chose you to replace your father

216
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,559
As for Fei Ying

217
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,400
Darn it, those Tianluo.

218
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,960
I can't believe they were so cruel to you.

219
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,119
It's one thing if it's somewhere else.

220
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,239
But if there's a scar left on your face,

221
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,479
what are we going to do?

222
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,559
Uncle,

223
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,919
they're just superficial wounds.

224
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
It's nothing serious.

225
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,880
Who knows if those Tianluo

226
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,280
used any poison on you

227
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
while torturing you?

228
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,039
I need to give you a thorough check.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,919
Let me do it instead.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,400
You people from Tang Sect only know about poisoning and antidotes.

231
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
When it comes to medicine,

232
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
how can you compare to me?

233
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,559
You only know a little about medicine.

234
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,799
Don't make Linlang's condition worse.

235
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,640
You’re so arrogant.

236
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,320
Sima Kong,

237
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,320
I still remember

238
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,719
how you and Lu Jiu

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,599
used to argue like this.

240
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,799
See?

241
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,280
You don't stand a chance.

242
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,080
He clearly still thinks about Lu.

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,159
Third Hall Master.

244
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,440
Don't be so downcast.

245
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,479
It's me who raised an ungrateful son.

246
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,119
At worst,

247
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,840
I'll go to Tianluo myself and bring him back.

248
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,960
How dare they treat our Linlang like this.

249
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,239
We of Fenglei Hall

250
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,719
don't want someone like him.

251
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,559
Third Hall Master,

252
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,440
I...

253
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,599
I didn't mean to target you.

254
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,599
What he said is right.

255
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
I, Xu Xiang,

256
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,919
from today onward,

257
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,559
will consider myself as having no son.

258
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,919
It's fine.

259
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,119
Don't be like this, everyone.

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
He's no longer Lu Jiu.

261
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,239
And I'm not the old Xu Linlang anymore.

262
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,200
I won't be troubled by these trivial matters of love anymore.

263
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,599
I won't get lost in them, Linlang.

264
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
To be honest,

265
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,520
when I rebuilt Fenglei Hall,

266
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,520
I still had some selfish motives.

267
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,719
But this time in Tianluo,

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,640
seeing so many wronged people,

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,440
I decided to stand up for them against Tianluo.

270
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Just like my father did.

271
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,119
Make proper arrangements

272
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,719
for the returning former members of Fenglei Hall.

273
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,400
Let me know if you need anything.

274
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,039
Yes.

275
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
I'll take my leave now.

276
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,599
Mm.

277
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,479
The Hall Master hasn't slept for several days.

278
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

279
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,359
When it's time to show concern,

280
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
you need to take the initiative.

281
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,760
Rebuilding Fenglei Hall

282
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,119
is not something that can be accomplished overnight.

283
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,559
You can't keep staying up without sleep.

284
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't make trouble.

285
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,359
I still have a lot to do.

286
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,119
I don't think you're losing sleep because you're busy.

287
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,679
It's because of Lu Jiu, isn't it?

288
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,000
Holding on to someone who's already gone

289
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,320
is it really worth it?

290
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,159
Come with me.

291
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,760
Where are you taking me?

292
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,359
Slow down.

293
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,520
Don't run.

294
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,400
Take it easy.

295
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,000
Slow down—come on!

296
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,679
Slow down.

297
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,840
The Shangyuan Lantern Festival at Gushan

298
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,719
is the liveliest.

299
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,799
Don't think about anything tonight.

300
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,760
Just enjoy yourself for once.

301
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,320
You two, take a look at the lanterns.

302
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,159
I'm right here.

303
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,520
The Shangyuan Festival came so quickly.

304
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,039
I promise you,

305
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,599
no matter where we go in the future,

306
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,119
I'll always go to the Shangyuan Lantern Festival with you.

307
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,359
Whether you're Fei Ying or Lu Jiu,

308
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,719
right now,

309
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,679
I have a question I want to ask you.

310
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,400
Is there a place for me in your heart?

311
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,239
Even if it's just a little.

312
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,880
No.

313
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
The former members of Fenglei Hall keep returning.

314
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,400
The people live in peace and prosperity.

315
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
It's as if things have returned to how they were twenty years ago.

316
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,400
Mm.

317
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,439
Right now,

318
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,839
I don't like any of these things at all.

319
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,119
Do whatever you want.

320
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,959
Don't force yourself because of me.

321
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,319
Really.

322
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,880
Look at that.

323
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,359
Blockhead.

324
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,520
Sorry, big brother, sorry.

325
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,719
Still as reckless as ever.

326
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,880
From now on, stay close to me wherever we go.

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,560
Don't take a single step away.

328
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:12,920
Okay.

329
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,640
Back then, you said during the Lantern Festival

330
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,800
you'd take me to see the lanterns.

331
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,119
And release sky lanterns.

332
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,920
But where were you?

333
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,479
Fei Ying, look.

334
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,839
It's all my fault.

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,359
I insisted on dragging you out.

336
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,239
I know you never liked crowds.

337
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,719
How about we go back?

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,359
No need.

339
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,959
Since you like it,

340
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I'll stay with you.

341
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,439
Don't always call me "senior sister."

342
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,199
Call me

343
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,199
Yemei.

344
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,439
Yemei.

345
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,920
Is that better?

346
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,119
Fei Ying

347
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,520
Do you want to eat white sugar cake?

348
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,719
Candied hawthorn

349
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,479
Take a look, come and see

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,199
Just dipped

351
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,319
Candied hawthorn

352
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,319
Do you want one?

353
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,719
I, Xu Linlang, am straightforward with my feelings and grudges

354
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,119
I never like to drag things out

355
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:04,800
Lu Jiu

356
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,800
From now on, you'll be my best friend

357
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,160
Fei Ying, what's wrong?

358
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,359
I...

359
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,319
I think I remembered someone

360
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,040
Who?

361
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,920
I can't remember clearly

362
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,520
But...

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,359
She liked to eat candied hawthorn

364
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,040
My head hurts a little

365
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,359
I'll head back first

366
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,199
Ye Mei

367
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,959
I'll go shopping with you next time

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,359
The things we've experienced

369
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,920
The people in our hearts

370
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Will only hide in the corners of our hearts

371
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,839
They will never disappear without a trace

372
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I knew it.

373
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,439
You're just pretending to be strong.

374
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,000
Who's pretending to be strong?

375
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,599
I just got sand in my eyes.

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,599
Just don't let your heart get confused.

377
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,239
I understand how you feel right now.

378
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,760
Speaking from experience,

379
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,319
I have to say something.

380
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,560
The best way to forget someone

381
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
is to broaden your horizons.

382
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,280
Look at other people more.

383
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,760
If that's what you think,

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
during your days back in the capital,

385
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,719
you must have met quite a few others.

386
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,199
Shh.

387
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,800
Don't let him hear you.

388
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,359
I think you're the one pretending.

389
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
No matter how many others you meet,

390
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,400
you still can't forget Lord Geng.

391
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,079
I...

392
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,119
How could I be the same as you?

393
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,160
Lord Geng hasn't forgotten me.

394
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,920
I...

395
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,599
Don't worry.

396
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,839
I'm fine.

397
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,199
If you really like her,

398
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,760
now

399
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,199
is your last chance.

400
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,040
Thank you.

401
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,719
Actually, there are many kinds of candied fruit.

402
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,439
Besides the hawthorn ones,

403
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,920
there are grape, orange, dried apricot, and walnut ones too.

404
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,439
Each type of candied fruit has its own strengths.

405
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,479
You can try other flavors besides hawthorn.

406
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,319
Why are you looking at me like that?

407
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,560
I usually see you as quiet and reserved.

408
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,160
Why are you so talkative today?

409
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,359
I just wanted to try a different style.

410
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,280
Then maybe forget it.

411
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,199
I still prefer your old style.

412
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,560
I like you.

413
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,479
Did Bai Yu say anything else to you?

414
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,800
She told me

415
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,079
that the best way to forget someone

416
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,719
is to broaden your horizons and meet new people.

417
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,680
It's like these candied fruits.

418
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,160
If there's no hawthorn,

419
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,839
you can use oranges instead.

420
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,800
Compared to Lu Jiu,

421
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,280
you're actually pretty great too.

422
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,280
But people aren't candied fruit.

423
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,119
It's not that easy to just switch.

424
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,640
I've made an important discovery.

425
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,119
What's wrong?

426
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,319
This is mine to drink.

427
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,119
I understand, I understand.

428
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,000
You want money, right?

429
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,160
I've known you for so long.

430
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,319
I know these basic rules.

431
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,959
Here.

432
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,319
That's not what I meant.

433
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,880
Alright, alright, let's get to the main point.

434
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,839
I've thought it over.

435
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,719
The key to fighting against Tianluo

436
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
is to get the Wuxiang Treasure before they do.

437
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:10,839
This—

438
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,520
I found this in the old records of Fenglei Hall.

439
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
All the clues related to the Wuxiang Treasure.

440
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,560
Are you even listening to me?

441
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,359
No wonder you've been working day and night lately.

442
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,199
Reviewing documents.

443
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,599
So you had a plan all along.

444
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,280
A clue pointing to the location of the treasure

445
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,920
There are four pieces of the map in total

446
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,280
Three of them

447
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,239
are already in the hands of Dugu and Lu Kun

448
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,199
There is still one piece left

449
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,359
Its whereabouts have been unknown since the destruction of Fenglei Hall

450
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,400
Could it be in the hands of the Tang Clan?

451
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,800
My master originally sent me to infiltrate Lu Jiu's side

452
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
because he suspected

453
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,400
that Lu Kun was hiding the fourth piece of the map from Dugu

454
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,319
After all, the two of them

455
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,599
have never really trusted each other

456
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,520
The Tang Clan doesn't have any piece

457
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,640
Then you all

458
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,880
No

459
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,079
Then why are they still

460
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
circling around the Wuxiang treasure every day?

461
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,520
Whoever gets the treasure will rule the world

462
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,199
Even if there's only a slight chance

463
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,079
no one would give up this opportunity

464
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,880
However

465
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,280
this last piece of the map

466
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,599
where could it be?

467
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,719
The Tianluo people tortured me harshly

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,599
as if I actually knew

469
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,079
Hairpin

470
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,920
Isn't this just an ordinary hairpin?

471
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,880
Maybe there's some kind of mechanism

472
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,439
Let me examine it carefully

473
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,319
The last piece of the map

474
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,359
is indeed with Luo Linlang.

475
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,520
Fei Ying,

476
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,439
I am willing to retrieve the treasure map for you, godfather.

477
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
No rush.

478
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,839
I have something even more important

479
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,400
for you to handle.

480
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,680
As long as it is your command,

481
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,439
Fei Ying

482
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,920
will do my utmost.

483
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,880
Your marriage to Ye Mei

484
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,520
has been delayed for a long time.

485
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,520
Today,

486
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,760
I will arrange for you two to get married.

487
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,719
Fei Ying,

488
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,920
if you do not wish to marry me,

489
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,719
I will go and tell my father to call off this engagement.

490
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,000
As members of Tianluo,

491
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,479
we must follow orders.

492
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,760
Even if neither of us wants this,

493
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,239
we simply have no right

494
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
to choose.

495
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,959
Linlang knows you, after all.

496
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,680
You could have just come to see me openly.

497
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,479
Why come in the middle of the night?

498
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,119
And call me out to such a remote place?

499
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,359
Master.

500
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,239
What else could it be?

501
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,640
Do you think I'm like Old Yan,

502
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,319
someone who betrays their own people?

503
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,839
What have you done to Old Yan?

504
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,479
Everything he did was because I forced him.

505
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,439
If you really forced him,

506
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,239
why would you be so worried about him?

507
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,520
You came to Gushan this time,

508
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,959
probably because you want me to do something for you.

509
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,479
Old Yan

510
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,640
is your bargaining chip with me.

511
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,800
I do have something

512
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,359
I want you to take care of.

513
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,319
The treasure code left by Luofeng

514
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,479
is hidden in the hairpin left by Linlang's mother.

515
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,640
Steal it for me.

516
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,560
Not only will I release Old Yan,

517
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,239
I can also let you return to Tang Sect.

518
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,079
Return to Tang Sect?

519
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,880
Do you really think I want that kind of life?

520
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,319
I once promised Linlang

521
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,719
that I would face her with my true self.

522
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,040
I won't live in the shadows anymore.

523
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,640
Do you not care about Old Yan's life or death?

524
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,160
The Wuxiang treasure

525
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,439
if it falls into someone like Dugu's hands,

526
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,479
it would be a terrible waste.

527
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,839
Do you want him to destroy all the blueprints

528
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,359
of the previous dynasty's techniques?

529
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,280
Petty tricks.

530
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,479
You think you can hurt me with that?

531
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,599
The leader of Tang Sect.

532
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,439
Can't even tell that this dart is poisoned.

533
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,479
How did you know I was here?

534
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicine.

535
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,079
Tang Sect has spies.

536
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,680
Our Wind Thunder Hall also has sentinels.

537
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
A strange fisherman came to our Lone Mountain territory.

538
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,199
He was already under our surveillance.

539
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:42,959
Old thief.

540
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,599
I advise you to surrender.

541
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,839
The hall master has already stationed our people all around.

542
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
You can't escape.

543
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,319
Then let's see.

544
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,079
But before that,

545
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll deal with this traitorous disciple first.

546
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,719
Xing'er.

547
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,719
Xing'er.

548
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,280
Come, sit.

549
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,079
Master

550
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,520
It's just a small injury, I can handle it myself.

551
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,040
No need to trouble you.

552
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,040
Don't call me Master.

553
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,239
I consider you a friend.

554
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,359
If you keep being so polite,

555
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,599
I'll get angry.

556
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,760
I'm just a servant.

557
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:39,319
And I even hurt your friend before.

558
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,439
I really don't deserve your kindness.

559
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,560
You clearly did it for the one you love.

560
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,040
Yet you say it was for me.

561
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,719
There's nothing between me and Sima Kong.

562
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,319
Nothing at all.

563
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,880
But you still shielded him from a hidden weapon.

564
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,199
That day, Sima Kong

565
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,199
swore to the heavens right in front of me.

566
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,439
And you still wouldn't agree to him.

567
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,439
Master

568
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,959
I swear to the heavens,

569
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,280
there is nothing romantic between me and Sima Kong.

570
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,599
Saving him

571
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,079
was only to repay the kindness he once showed me.

572
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,079
Besides,

573
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
he already has someone he loves.

574
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,520
He doesn't like you.

575
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,479
Then who is it?

576
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,479
Do I know her?

577
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,280
Come in.

578
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,599
You never used to knock before.

579
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,079
Why are you being so polite today?

580
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,920
There are differences between men and women.

581
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,920
It's better to be polite.

582
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,800
How is Xing'er’s injury?

583
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,040
She’s fine now.

584
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,239
You don’t need to worry.

585
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,640
It was my oversight this time.

586
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,839
But I didn’t expect my master

587
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,239
Tang Wuxin would come in person.

588
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,439
He is your master, after all.

589
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,000
He raised you.

590
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,160
You broke ties with him.

591
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,599
You must be very sad too.

592
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,959
Although he did raise me,

593
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,239
he bought me.

594
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,359
He trained me

595
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,479
just to turn me into a tool.

596
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,719
Fei Ying in Tianluo

597
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,079
was in the same situation.

598
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,359
Even if he became Fei Ying,

599
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,959
you still can’t forget him?

600
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,839
I didn’t say that.

601
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,119
Let’s not talk about this anymore.

602
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,959
Ever since you came in,

603
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
I noticed something was off about you.

604
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,239
I suppose Xing’er has already told you.

605
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,000
She didn’t say anything.

606
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,239
Don’t overthink it.

607
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,079
I like you.

608
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,680
Lu Jiu no longer exists.

609
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,239
Can you give me a chance?

610
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,640
Let me be the one by your side.

611
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,479
I’m sorry.

612
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,280
There’s no room for anyone else in my heart.

613
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,000
Linlang

614
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,160
So this is where you are.

615
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,479
News just came in.

616
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,920
That rascal Lu Jiu

617
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,359
He actually

618
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,800
is really going to marry that demoness Tian Luo

619
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,520
for real.
