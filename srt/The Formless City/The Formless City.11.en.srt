1
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,919
So from the very beginning,

2
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,559
my big brother

3
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
pretended to be dead and escaped without taking me along.

4
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,600
I knew it.

5
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
I knew I was just a burden.

6
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

7
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
The Lu Jiu in front of me

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,759
and that ruthless killer

9
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,119
Tianluo assassin Fei Ying

10
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,399
are not the same person.

11
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,160
That's also why

12
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,839
I kept all this from you.

13
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,039
I can hide it for a while,

14
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,440
but not forever.

15
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,199
In the end, I still have to face it myself.

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,399
So, are you still going to keep investigating?

17
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
Yes.

18
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,039
If I really am the ruthless killer,

19
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
I will turn myself in.

20
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,600
Alright.

21
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,039
I'll investigate with you.

22
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,240
I have one more thing I need your help with.

23
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,399
Don't tell Linlang.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Why?

25
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,919
Lately,

26
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
another person keeps appearing in my mind.

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,279
This isn't good.

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,720
Linlang is still outside.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Tonight,

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,919
none of you will leave here alive.

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
You didn't even have time to put your clothes on properly.

32
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,320
Are you worried about me?

33
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
I...

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,839
This painting—

35
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,759
Why are you still keeping it?

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
You already gave it to me.

37
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,759
How I deal with it is my business.

38
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,559
I'm afraid

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,040
my memories of you

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
will become like this painting

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
gradually fading away

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,399
Then I'll let you get to know me again

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,399
holding candied hawthorn and pork bones

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,200
Well then

45
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,799
I'll paint you a new one

46
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
No need

47
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,679
Lu Jiu

48
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:39,720
Come help quickly

49
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,799
Let's hurry out and help him

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Sima Kong is still injured

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,559
You brat

52
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,959
I thought you ran off again

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Do I have to remind you to put on clothes when you have time?

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
How many times have I told you

55
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,279
I left a note

56
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,839
Subdue those two

57
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,959
Then I'll believe what you say

58
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
It's a deal

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,679
What are you waiting for?

60
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,679
Show your skills

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,119
It's not up to me

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,320
Not good

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,079
Auntie is a poison expert

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Trying to show off in front of me

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,720
You'd better drink milk for two more years

66
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,040
You

67
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,559
Not bad

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Lu Jiu

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,079
The map to the Wuxiang treasure has four pieces

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,239
Your father and Li Chu each have one piece

71
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,799
Except for the Fenglei Hall piece, which is missing

72
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
There's one more piece

73
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,880
lost in the martial world

74
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,359
Recently, I found out about that piece of the map

75
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,000
It's with the Jiangnan lecher

76
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,720
in the hands of Young Master Wen

77
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,079
Daughter, you must decide for your father

78
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,399
Retrieve the map fragment.

79
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,359
Alright.

80
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,839
When you return victorious,

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,799
I will reward you generously.

82
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,279
By the way,

83
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,799
this is your favorite rice cake.

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
I prepared it especially for you.

85
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,160
Eat it before you set out.

86
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
Thank you, Father.

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
City Lord.

88
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,640
Father is busy with official duties.

89
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,119
I, Yemei, will take my leave.

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,399
Useless fools.

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I sent you to capture Fei Ying.

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,839
Yet you were all defeated.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
You even alerted the Investigation Bureau.

94
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Please calm your anger, City Lord.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,839
Although Fei Ying hasn't regained his memory,

96
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,239
his martial skills remain intact.

97
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,440
Within Tianluo,

98
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,000
aside from the City Lord and the young lady,

99
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,119
I'm afraid no one else can defeat him.

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
You're awake.

101
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,320
I think

102
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,480
I had a dream.

103
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,279
I dreamed of a woman.

104
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,839
It's just...

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,640
I was here dealing with the assassin's corpse,

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,200
while you were fooling around with a woman in your dream.

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
No, I wasn't.

108
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,119
You all

109
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,720
really didn't see that woman?

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
No.

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Then maybe

112
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,279
it really was just a dream.

113
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,079
You didn't react much to transforming this time.

114
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,279
You even have the energy to daydream.

115
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,799
Let me rest for a bit.

116
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,799
Why should I?

117
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,880
This bed is mine.

118
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,040
I want to lie down too.

119
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Then let's do it together.

120
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:26,959
I...

121
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,359
It must be that my old wound reopened.

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,400
Let me take a look for you.

123
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,039
You two are acting really strange today.

124
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,919
Even those powerful assassins before

125
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
couldn't hurt you.

126
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,320
Why are you so badly injured this time?

127
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,679
Well...

128
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,479
It was to save you.

129
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,440
And you two were in the bathroom

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
whispering for so long.

131
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,760
You left me outside all alone.

132
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh, right.

133
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,119
You two were in the bathroom for so long,

134
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,159
what were you talking about?

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,479
It was nothing, just...

136
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,119
discussing our next move.

137
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,440
This must be

138
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,080
the reason he wants to keep it from Linlang for now.

139
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,719
We really have you to thank this time, Linlang.

140
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,320
I didn't expect your skill with hidden weapons

141
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,080
to be even better than mine.

142
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,599
It's not that I'm good with hidden weapons.

143
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,520
I just read about vital points in medical books.

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,479
I'd never tried it before.

145
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,599
I was just taking a chance.

146
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,760
But that poison was really powerful.

147
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,960
Why didn't you use it before?

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,159
That's my last resort.

149
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,239
Unless it's absolutely necessary,

150
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,200
I won't use it.

151
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,119
Then why did you use it so easily today?

152
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,799
When I saw you in danger,

153
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,960
I couldn't think about anything else.

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
Alright.

155
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,400
Let's not worry about those details.

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,239
Didn't you notice

157
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,359
that today's assassins were different?

158
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,960
What did you notice?

159
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,679
The killers we met before were ruthless,

160
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,919
but they only wanted to capture me alive.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,320
But today's assassins

162
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,719
wanted to

163
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
kill us.

164
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,880
The assassins are in the shadows, and we're exposed.

165
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,239
We can't just sit and wait for death.

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,520
We have to take action.

167
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,359
Yes.

168
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,159
Useless.

169
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,640
Please calm your anger, Young Master.

170
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,559
Sang Sanniang and Gu Rentu

171
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,559
are already the top assassins in the Assassin Alliance.

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,119
If it weren't for Xu Linlang and Sima Kong protecting him,

173
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,719
we would have captured the Second Young Master long ago.

174
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,719
Lu Jiu only unleashes his true abilities

175
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,520
when facing life and death situations.

176
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,119
If he makes it safely to Wu Town,

177
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,320
what chance will we have left?

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
While those two old guys

179
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,359
still don't know the key to Fei Ying regaining his memory,

180
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,159
we have to hurry.

181
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,359
Let's act quickly.

182
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,200
Young master's meaning is

183
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,320
they want to lure him back to Mist Town,

184
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,359
to search for clues from seven years ago

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,520
about the lost Faceless Treasure?

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
I'll give them a hand.

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Be careful, it could be a trap.

188
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,520
Mm.

189
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,119
They definitely didn't expect

190
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,440
the trap we set for them

191
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,359
would turn out to be an itching powder.

192
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,239
They must be scratching like monkeys right now.

193
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,359
When we first set out, I didn't know any martial arts.

194
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
I was worried I'd hold you all back.

195
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,000
I never thought that making incense

196
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,679
would actually come in handy.

197
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,760
Your incense-making skills, my knowledge of medicine,

198
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,520
and Sima Kong's trap designs

199
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
really gave them a lesson.

200
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,000
They got to see how capable we are.

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,440
You're kind by nature.

202
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,520
Even towards assassins,

203
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,760
you can't bring yourself to kill.

204
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,320
You just played a trick on them,

205
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,599
just slowed them down a bit.

206
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,719
Everything in this world has a spirit.

207
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,719
Even though they're assassins,

208
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,119
they're just following orders.

209
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,200
No one is born wanting to be an assassin.

210
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,119
Alright,

211
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,960
once we reach Wu Town,

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,640
all the mysteries will be solved.

213
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,119
It's still more than ten days' journey to Wu Town.

214
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,840
There aren't any towns along the way.

215
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,559
How about

216
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,960
we buy some supplies here

217
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,039
before we set out again?

218
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:11,640
Sounds good.

219
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,479
We still have the money we took from the Iron Vault

220
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
and haven't had a chance to spend it yet.

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Why are you looking at me?

222
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,559
I only know how to make money, not how to spend it.

223
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,559
Alright then.

224
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,760
Let me show you

225
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,880
how a rich kid

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,159
spends money.

227
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,039
Let's go.

228
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Miss, take a look.

229
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,080
These are all top-quality fabrics.

230
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,320
What do you think?

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Feel free to choose.

232
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,119
Do you think this color looks nice?

233
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,039
It's so beautiful.

234
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,359
Look, this one is really pretty.

235
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,840
It looks good.

236
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,119
Try it on.

237
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:23,960
How is it?

238
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,359
Not bad.

239
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,919
But something's still missing.

240
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,719
Boss Kong, pay the bill.

241
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,479
Why? Because you have money.

242
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,919
Boss, please settle the bill.

243
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,599
That's a lot.

244
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,719
I don't even know how to choose.

245
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,840
What's there to choose?

246
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,559
Boss.

247
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,679
Buy them all.

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,119
All of them?

249
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:49,799
Yes.

250
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,880
All of them.

251
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,239
Sima Kong.

252
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,799
Hurry up.

253
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,919
It's really nice.

254
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,359
Take it.

255
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Spending money feels so good.

256
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,200
Did you used to

257
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,599
live like this every day?

258
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,400
I often have days where I spend money.

259
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:27,520
But this is my first time being a sidekick.

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,719
Did I spend too much?

261
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,320
This is nothing.

262
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,479
Buy whatever you want.

263
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,359
Really.

264
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,719
Right?

265
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,719
Kong Kong.

266
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,359
Yes.

267
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,239
Sorry.

268
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,119
It's okay.

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Let's go.

270
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,320
No mole on the face.

271
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,359
His behavior is also different from Fei Ying.

272
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,119
Could I have made a mistake?

273
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,359
No.

274
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,280
I need to return to the capital.

275
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,039
I have to re-verify this person's identity.

276
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,799
Spending money really feels great.

277
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,200
It's just a shame these things are hard to carry on the road.

278
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,400
It's really inconvenient.

279
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,159
It's much easier after returning them.

280
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,159
I'll just keep this one.

281
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
After all this work,

282
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,159
it was just for the lowest prize.

283
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
We're leaving soon.

284
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,479
I'll go check out some other places.

285
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,640
Take your time eating.

286
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,880
There's nothing I can do.

287
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
It's because someone likes it.

288
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,679
Yeah.

289
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,520
As long as she likes it, that's enough.

290
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,359
It's hard to imagine hearing that

291
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
coming from you.

292
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,119
And also,

293
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,119
when you were returning everything you bought just now,

294
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,520
you looked

295
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,559
even more reluctant than Linlang.

296
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,280
In the past,

297
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
I only cared about making money.

298
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,520
Spending money always felt painful.

299
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,919
But this time, it's different.

300
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,640
Besides feeling the pain,

301
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,080
I actually felt a bit of joy.

302
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,719
Do you ever feel that way when you spend money?

303
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,640
Maybe

304
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,719
it's because I'm spending it on Linlang.

305
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm glad you think that way.

306
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,599
That way, I can trust her to you.

307
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,359
What do you mean by that?

308
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,919
Nothing in particular.

309
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,000
This way, I can be at ease.

310
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,919
With you accompanying her on the journey.

311
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,479
That's true.

312
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,559
We really should think about our departure.

313
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,760
After leaving the city, we'll reach the Chaobai River.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,719
Traveling downstream along the river is the fastest.

315
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,919
We can reach Mist Town in ten days.

316
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,919
No.

317
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,280
Now, there are more assassins along the way.

318
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
They're appearing more and more frequently.

319
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,440
It's clear they've figured out our route.

320
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,599
We need to adapt to the situation.

321
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,719
And act when the opportunity arises.

322
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Take a detour through the mountain path.

323
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,359
Good idea.

324
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,000
If we all leave the city together, we'll be too conspicuous.

325
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
You go with Linlang.

326
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,919
I'll go alone.

327
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,719
But—it's decided.

328
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,559
In one hour,

329
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,599
we'll meet up on the main road.

330
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,160
Bone-breaker Gu Rentu.

331
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,079
Smiling Blade Sang Sanniang.

332
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,040
These two are both famous top-tier assassins in the martial world.

333
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,359
Sir

334
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,839
The bounty on Lu Jiu has increased again.

335
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,439
It's now fifteen hundred Chi coins.

336
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,920
That's your

337
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,000
ten years' salary.

338
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,920
But

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,680
that's just a few days' expenses for Princess Bai Yu.

340
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,680
Wasn't that in the past?

341
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,560
Hasn't she changed now?

342
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,359
Tang Sect's exclusive secret poison, Chi Wuchang.

343
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,959
But the method of poisoning

344
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,640
doesn't seem like the Tang Sect's style.

345
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,839
I remember you said

346
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,520
the Tang Sect wins with skill.

347
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,359
They've always looked down on

348
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,359
such simple and crude poisoning methods.

349
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,680
Tang Sect spies carry poison on them.

350
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,800
It's also for committing suicide to keep secrets if exposed.

351
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
So

352
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,800
there's only one possibility.

353
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,239
Only something more important than their lives.

354
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,640
I've already asked the local villagers.

355
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,239
A man who dealt in antiques used to live here.

356
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,000
But he hasn't returned for six or seven years.

357
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,319
Tomb raiding for gold.

358
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,640
Assassination and tracking.

359
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,839
It really is Fei Ying.

360
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Who?

361
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,359
Who sent you?

362
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,800
Sir

363
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
He killed himself.

364
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,839
He hid poison in his tongue.

365
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,839
This man is a Tianluo death warrior.

366
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,439
We originally wanted to use Lu Jiu as bait.

367
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,199
Find out the whereabouts of Luming City and Lu Kun.

368
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,239
But I didn't expect

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,920
that Lu Jiu's side had both assassins

370
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,359
and Tianluo's loyal killers.

371
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:45,800
It seems

372
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,280
Lu Jiu is the key to finding the Wuxiang treasure.

373
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,520
It's just that

374
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,439
they say

375
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,920
Dugu once held power over the entire court.

376
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,160
Back then,

377
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
and now,

378
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,319
he will surely try to stop us again.

379
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,359
That's right.

380
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,199
To avoid repeating past mistakes,

381
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,839
we need to return to the capital this time

382
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,760
and thoroughly investigate Tianluo's background.

383
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Are you going to confront Tianluo head-on?

384
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,079
What's wrong?

385
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:10,959
Are you scared?

386
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
I'm not scared at all.

387
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,839
As long as you're here, I know you'll protect me.

388
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,160
Linlang,

389
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,800
please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,920
If

391
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,599
I really was a Tianluo assassin in the past,

392
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,719
staying by your side

393
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,359
would only put you in more danger.

394
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,040
Why?

395
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,560
Leaving without saying goodbye to make us cry?

396
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,599
You guys...

397
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,719
You haven't paid the reward yet.

398
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,400
How could I let you escape so easily?

399
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
We've known each other for so long.

400
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,000
Sima Kong can tell what you're thinking at a glance.

401
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,319
You've been acting strange ever since you left the Iron Wall Vault.

402
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,160
The closer you get to the truth about your identity,

403
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,319
the more afraid you become.

404
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm afraid for you.

405
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:09,920
I...

406
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,560
You're afraid your background will drag me down with you.

407
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,920
We've fought side by side all this time.

408
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,280
None of us can do without each other.

409
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,199
Lu Jiu,

410
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,959
Please don't leave, okay?

411
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,280
Just a reminder,

412
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,359
My debt-collecting skills

413
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,599
are the best in the world.

414
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,079
Even if you run to the ends of the earth,

415
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,400
I can still bring you back.

416
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,239
You all

417
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,160
Enough, stop fussing

418
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,319
Let's get going quickly

419
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,719
Can't even handle a small matter

420
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
I didn't expect it either

421
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,319
that Geng Zhao from the Inspection Bureau would show up there

422
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:41,920
Sir

423
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,239
I'm concerned

424
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,560
If this matter

425
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,439
reaches His Majesty's ears

426
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,719
My Tianluo's agents are everywhere in the court

427
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,599
Even if he returns to the capital

428
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,920
he can't do anything to me

429
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,560
So, what you mean is

430
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
I have my own arrangements for Geng Zhao

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,359
The urgent matter

432
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
is to bring Fei Ying back

433
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,839
He's the key to finding the Wuxiang treasure

434
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,439
We absolutely can't let him wander the martial world

435
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,479
or fall into someone else's hands

436
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,760
Understood

437
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:19,680
It's just that my skills are limited

438
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,359
I'm afraid I'm no match for Fei Ying

439
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,959
The young lady is currently on a mission in the southwest

440
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,839
Could we ask her for help?

441
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,880
The fact that Fei Ying is still alive

442
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,680
must not be revealed to Ye Mei

443
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
I understand

444
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,839
This place

445
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,119
is limited by geography and public funds.

446
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,640
We can't build a suspension bridge or a stone arch bridge.

447
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,439
For now, we can only make do.

448
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,560
We'll build according to the blueprints.

449
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,680
I understand, Master.

450
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,439
Every day,

451
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,000
set the time slots for pedestrians and boats.

452
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,479
Connect the bridge during pedestrian hours.

453
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,520
Retract the bridge during boat hours.

454
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,880
Finish drawing these blueprints and send them to the government office.

455
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,439
Let the magistrate decide.

456
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,040
Why bother deciding?

457
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,800
These blueprints were drawn by the sect leader himself.

458
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,439
Even the Ministry of Works wouldn't dare alter them.

459
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,239
Don't be disrespectful.

460
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,160
Our Tang Sect relies on our skills.

461
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,400
We take payment for our work.

462
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,920
We must not indulge or look down on our clients.

463
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,319
I know my mistake, Master.

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,520
Master,

465
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,959
Lord Geng Zhao from the Inspection Office is here.

466
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,880
Help him finish the blueprints.

467
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,920
Lord Geng, your visit honors us. Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

468
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,160
Please come inside.

469
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,839
The Tang Sect is busy.

470
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,160
Let's get straight to the point.

471
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,760
Gu Rentu and Sang Sanniang from the Assassin Alliance

472
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,839
were killed by the Tang Sect's poison, Red Wuchang.

473
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,680
How do you explain this, Master Tang?

474
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,479
If Lord Geng is involved, you must have all the evidence.

475
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Why didn't the Inspection Office send someone to arrest us themselves?

476
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,079
Why trouble Lord Geng to come in person?

477
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,359
The poison

478
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,560
is indeed a Tang Sect secret formula,

479
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,119
but the method of killing is unheard of.

480
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,239
Please clarify, Lord Geng.

481
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,119
The person who killed Gu Rentu and Sang Sanniang

482
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
used silver needles as the weapon

483
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,079
dipped them in poison and struck their vital points

484
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,239
adding poison to poison

485
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,599
which is why both died instantly

486
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,400
In addition

487
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,920
at the place where they were killed

488
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,239
we also encountered Tianluo's death warriors

489
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,239
Our Tang Sect abides by the law

490
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
The development of the poison Chi Wuchang

491
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,719
was commissioned by the Ministry of War

492
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,160
for use in warfare

493
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,760
Tang Sect disciples would never use it recklessly

494
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,880
Tang Sect's poison-making skills are unrivaled

495
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:14,599
It is said that Tianluo's weapons are also forged by Tang Sect

496
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,880
Our Tang Sect

497
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,760
only takes payment for services rendered

498
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:20,479
We moved from Shu to the capital

499
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,920
for the convenience of business dealings

500
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,520
Tianluo uses weapons forged by Tang Sect

501
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
simply because they value our craftsmanship

502
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,760
and for no other reason

503
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,839
If you do not believe me

504
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,119
I can

505
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,640
hand over all the records of Chi Wuchang

506
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,479
for your inspection

507
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,119
Thank you, Master Tang

508
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
By the way

509
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,719
Master Tang's chief disciple

510
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
is named Sima Kong

511
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,839
He is highly skilled

512
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,640
Master Tang intends to train him as his successor

513
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,359
I hope that one day

514
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,959
I can meet this young master Sima

515
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,040
and have an exchange with him

516
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,640
You flatter me, Lord Geng

517
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,719
Someday, I will bring my disciple

518
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,640
to personally visit the Diancha Office

519
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,719
Tianluo assassins

520
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,839
Were recognized by Geng Zhao at a glance

521
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,040
City Lord Dugu was really careless

522
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,640
They've always been in league with Tianluo

523
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,959
All for the sake of the Wuxiang treasure

524
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:15,280
If Lord Tang says so

525
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,040
Isn't that rather heartbreaking

526
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,239
That was before

527
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,400
Now, Tianluo and Tang Sect

528
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,079
Have no connection whatsoever

529
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,560
That Red Wuchang is unique to the Tang Sect

530
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,719
Even if you want to distance yourself

531
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,359
The Diancha Division won't agree

532
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,680
Don't think I don't know

533
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,640
This time, the Tianluo assassins weren't targeting the Diancha Division

534
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:40,599
They wanted to kill my disciple, Sima Kong

535
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,079
Now even Geng Zhao is watching my disciple

536
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,680
This matter

537
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,439
How will you handle it

538
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,560
Lord Tang, please don't be angry

539
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm only after Lu Jiu

540
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,239
It's because your disciple and Lu Jiu

541
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,719
Are as close as brothers

542
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,439
They're inseparable

543
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,640
Working together to find the Wuxiang treasure

544
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,160
Was the agreement between us

545
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,199
But now

546
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,119
You also want to go after my disciple

547
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,560
Do you want to keep the Wuxiang treasure for yourself

548
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,119
I was wondering

549
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,520
Why Sima Kong would risk his life for Lu Jiu

550
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,520
Turns out, he takes after Lord Tang

551
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,640
Feelings...

552
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,199
are a person's weakness.

553
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,280
I've raised Sima Kong since he was a child.

554
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,839
He is the future young master who will take over Tang Sect.

555
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,359
Everything I've done

556
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,839
has been for the sake of Tang Sect.

557
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,760
I will never allow you to interfere.

558
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:44,280
Raised from childhood...

559
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,199
Wasn't my beloved disciple Fei Ying the same?

560
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,640
I poured all my effort into him.

561
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,760
But after finding clues to the treasure,

562
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,920
he tried to run away.

563
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,959
Let me give you a word of advice, Master Tang.

564
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,239
Don't place too much hope in those ungrateful brats.

565
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,719
Don't expect too much from them.

566
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,439
Hmph.

567
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,599
Tang Sect's family matters are none of your concern.

568
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
But when it comes to the treasure,

569
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,599
I have to get involved.

570
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
The Wuxiang Treasure...

571
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,239
It's still unclear who will claim it in the end.

572
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,079
Hmph.

573
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,839
Although there is no intention to harm anyone,

574
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
assassins keep attacking frequently.

575
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,719
We have no choice but to stay vigilant.

576
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,839
The traps inside the house are all set.

577
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,839
But in this remote wilderness,

578
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,040
assassins could be hiding anywhere.

579
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
It's impossible to guard against them all.

580
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,280
Before going to sleep,

581
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,640
I'll set up a few more traps in the nearby woods.

582
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:44,560
No need.

583
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,479
There’s nothing around except birds and wild animals.

584
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,199
No one else is here.

585
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,119
How do you know that?

586
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,800
I can hear them.

587
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,560
That’s true.

588
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,520
You now

589
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,959
are not the same as before.

590
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,560
Tonight, Lu Jiu and I will keep watch outside.

591
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,319
Linlang,

592
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,520
go inside and rest for a while.

593
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,439
No need.

594
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,560
Let’s all rest together in the abandoned temple.

595
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,040
You two go inside and rest.

596
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,560
I’ll stay outside alone.

597
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,640
First, to guard against assassins,

598
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,079
and second,

599
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,680
to prevent myself from hurting you.

600
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,079
But the weather is so cold.

601
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,959
It’s fine as long as I have a campfire.

602
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,479
Although he agreed to stay,

603
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,640
the barrier in his heart

604
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,040
is not so easy to overcome.

605
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,040
Doing this

606
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,400
is also for your safety.

607
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,000
Sir

608
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
We've already checked everything once.

609
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,920
They're all just

610
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,599
records of how Tang Sect made Chi Wuchang

611
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,800
and the causes and consequences.

612
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,119
Just like he said.

613
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,680
Nothing seems strange.

614
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,839
But

615
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
I still feel something's off.

616
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,839
What's off?

617
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:32,359
If I say it's a woman's intuition,

618
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,040
will you hit me?

619
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,719
If it were before, I wouldn't have believed you.

620
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,359
But these past few times,

621
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,680
you've predicted them all.

622
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,199
Go ahead, tell me.

623
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,400
I think the problem is

624
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,839
these files are just like Tang Sect's craftsmanship—

625
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,079
too meticulous.

626
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,880
You can't find any flaws.

627
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,680
It's as if

628
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
they were made just for others to see.

629
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,880
Did I say something wrong?

630
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,560
No.

631
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,839
Go on.

632
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,079
I think

633
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,199
since Tang Wuxin is actively helping with the investigation,

634
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,560
he must have already planned how to deal with it.

635
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,479
In a case investigation,

636
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,359
as long as a crime is committed, there will be evidence.

637
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
And in these files,

638
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,560
it also says Tang Sect once helped the Ministry of Works

639
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,920
design a project.

640
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,199
Meng Fei, the Ministry of Works' assistant minister,

641
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,719
once raised objections.

642
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,839
But later,

643
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,400
the project still went ahead as planned.

644
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,719
There were no obstacles at all.

645
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,119
Good analysis.

646
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,920
Let's hurry up and make the most of our time.

647
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,520
Let's go.

648
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,479
Sir

649
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,640
Where are you going?

650
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,760
Lu Jiu

651
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,119
Lu Jiu

652
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,479
What's wrong with you?

653
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
It's nothing.

654
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,239
It's just that lately,

655
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,719
my senses have been unusually sensitive.

656
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,319
Especially at night,

657
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,599
it feels like everything around me

658
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,640
can be heard and seen.

659
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,479
I can't fall asleep.

660
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,640
No wonder your dark circles have been getting worse lately.

661
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,280
I have a way to help.

662
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:20,560
Don't be afraid.
