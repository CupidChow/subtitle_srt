1
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Lu Jiu

2
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,839
Wait for me

3
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,559
I won't allow you to die before I return

4
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Even less will I allow

5
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,199
you to make Linlang sad

6
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,960
You

7
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,360
Are you okay?

8
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,119
I'm fine

9
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
You're always like this

10
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,039
so stubborn

11
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,119
making people worry about you

12
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
Just now

13
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,039
Were you outside the door the whole time?

14
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,160
What is it?

15
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Even though I'm just a trainee constable

16
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,000
where I stay

17
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,600
do I still need to report to Lord Geng?

18
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,839
Actually, just now

19
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,479
You're awake.

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,399
You finally woke up.

21
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,800
Do you know

22
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
I've been waiting for you for so long.

23
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,000
Sima Kong.

24
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,600
It's a relief that it's you this time.

25
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
What?

26
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,720
It's nothing.

27
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,679
How is Lu Jiu?

28
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,959
Thanks to your medicine,

29
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,600
Lu Jiu is fine now.

30
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,359
That's good.

31
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,640
What kind of medicine is this?

32
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,320
It can even cure incurable poisons.

33
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,040
No matter what kind of medicine it is,

34
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,399
as long as it can save Lu Jiu,

35
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,359
and you,

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
when you both smile,

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
that's the best medicine.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,119
You did all this

39
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
for us.

40
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,600
Didn't Lu Jiu get poisoned to save me?

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now we're even.

42
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
How is this even?

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
I checked your pulse.

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,559
You've lost all your martial arts skills.

45
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,160
On the journey to find the medicine,

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
what exactly happened?

47
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,359
I just returned something that didn't belong to me.

48
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,720
To a place where it didn't belong to me.

49
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,760
You don't need to worry about it so much.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,799
Now,

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,920
I can face you with my true self.

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Openly and honestly.

53
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,320
It's a good thing for me too.

54
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,359
A Tang Sect spy.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
There's nothing to hide.

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,320
How did you know I was from the Tang Sect?

57
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,320
Lie down quickly.

58
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,440
Lu Jiu told me.

59
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
He knows too.

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Ever since you helped him escape from prison,

61
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,359
he knew you weren't ordinary.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,640
Along the way,

63
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,480
you've shown mastery of many skills and crafts.

64
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,720
You're both brave and clever.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Other than the Tang Sect,

66
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,160
where else could there be such outstanding talent?

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Talent.

68
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
I've been investigating you all this time.

69
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,279
But you never looked down on me.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,720
You and I are both outsiders.

71
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,880
We rely on our skills to make a living.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,519
There's no such thing as looking down or not.

73
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,559
Besides,

74
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,920
You were just following orders when you investigated us.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,920
All this time,

76
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,480
you never hurt us.

77
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,119
We never guarded against you.

78
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,359
So you have even less reason to feel guilty toward me.

79
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,359
Doing these things for a friend

80
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,839
is always worth it.

81
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,559
Mm.

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,600
We are lifelong friends.

83
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,679
Lifelong friends.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,079
Young Master

85
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,119
Sneaking around at the door

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
As if afraid others wouldn't notice

87
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,200
Are you a secret agent of the Tang Sect?

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,119
Shh

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,799
Young Master

90
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,559
So early in the morning

91
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Can you keep your voice down?

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,040
I thought I was hiding myself well

93
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,760
But little did I know

94
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,480
They already knew my identity

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,399
What?

96
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,200
Then why didn't they react at all?

97
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,119
Because they never intended to deal with me

98
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,720
The friends chosen by the Young Master

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Are indeed trustworthy

100
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,959
I'm no longer the Young Master

101
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,559
The Sect Leader has given an order

102
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,399
From now on, everyone in the Tang Sect

103
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,640
and

104
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,839
Sima Kong

105
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,359
are to sever all ties

106
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,720
and become strangers

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,399
This time, I, Old Yan, came

108
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,000
just to say goodbye to you

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,160
All these years

110
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,119
I've never considered you a subordinate

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
If you don't mind

112
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,000
I hope you'll remember

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
you have a friend like me in the martial world

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,640
Making it all so sentimental

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
No wonder the Sect Leader expelled you

116
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,519
Your temperament now

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
suits Lu Jiu and the others better

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Alright

119
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,160
I still have a mission to complete

120
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll take my leave now

121
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,519
Getting all emotional even after everyone's left

122
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,119
Makes people reluctant to part with you

123
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,640
I

124
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,559
I'm almost fully recovered.

125
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,920
Do I still have to drink such bitter medicine?

126
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,320
Good medicine tastes bitter.

127
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,880
The poison in your body was only suppressed.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,160
It damaged your vitality.

129
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,760
You need to take good care of yourself.

130
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,160
Otherwise, you'll be left with lingering illness.

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,320
What will you do when you get old?

132
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,640
When I get old...

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,280
When I get old, won't you be by my side?

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm not afraid at all.

135
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,760
Who will still be by your side?

136
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,799
By then,

137
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,719
the one by your side will be your wife.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,719
I'm going to the Diancha Office.

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,359
to achieve my grand ambitions.

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
That's true.

141
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,239
At that time,

142
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,440
I'll definitely be married.

143
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,520
I just don't know

144
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,440
what my wife will look like.

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,719
She must be a well-bred lady.

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
From a scholarly family.

147
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,679
Yes.

148
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
Your Lu family is a prominent household.

149
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Only a well-bred lady from a scholarly family

150
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,320
would be a good match for you.

151
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,119
Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,320
That's right.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I still remember,

154
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
last time I went to your house,

155
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,559
I saw that your family

156
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,039
also has many medical anatomy books.

157
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,039
That counts as a scholarly family too.

158
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,359
How dare you tease me!

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
Be gentle!

160
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
After all,

161
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,320
I just came back from the brink of death.

162
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,320
That blow to my chest was like breaking a stone.

163
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,599
You almost knocked me out.

164
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
And you still dare to talk back!

165
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,479
I...

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,039
Honestly,

167
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,200
when I was unconscious,

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,359
I kept hearing

169
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,919
someone talking to me by the bedside.

170
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,799
And using a special method

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,960
to give me medicine.

172
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,520
Was that you?

173
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,640
The medicine has already cooled down.

174
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,799
You should take it quickly.

175
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,599
Take your medicine.

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,719
Alright.

177
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,119
I have one condition.

178
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
I want to eat candied hawthorn.

179
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,080
Tch.

180
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,640
Still acting like a child.

181
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,679
I'll go buy it for you right now.

182
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Since you're here,

183
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,320
come in.

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,640
I know you've never liked taking medicine since you were little.

185
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,400
Every time, I would use sweet rice cakes to coax you into taking it.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
So,

187
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,520
I specially bought sweet rice cakes and brought them to you.

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,599
If you weren't poisoned,

189
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,239
you wouldn't need to take medicine.

190
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,159
Fei Ying, I...

191
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,239
I didn't mean to hurt you.

192
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,119
I just...

193
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,840
just wanted to hurt the person I care about most.

194
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:31,960
Linlang is outside.

195
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,559
She probably heard it too.

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
Linlang and I

197
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,840
both have each other in our hearts.

198
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,719
No matter what happened between us in the past,

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
it doesn't matter to me now.

200
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,559
What exactly happened seven years ago?

201
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,479
It's been so many years.

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,280
I've been waiting for you all this time.

203
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,159
Is this the result of my waiting?

204
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,359
You don't need to wait for me.

205
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,159
I once

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,799
wanted to find out the truth too.

207
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,359
Because of that,

208
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,359
I even hurt Linlang.

209
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
I've figured it out now.

210
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,840
At this very moment,

211
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,239
I'm very happy.

212
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
The past

213
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,919
should be left behind.

214
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,239
No.

215
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,440
I must find out the truth.

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I need to give myself an answer.

217
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,840
Come, Linlang.

218
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,599
Can you eat properly?

219
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
What's going on?

220
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,359
My great strategist Sima.

221
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,359
Yes.

222
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,359
Isn't everyone just eating?

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Let's be serious.

224
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,239
These past few days,

225
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,760
I personally escorted those who were kidnapped

226
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,960
back to their homes one by one.

227
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,400
I took the opportunity to investigate the population of Mist Town.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,159
I didn't find any families with the surname Xu.

229
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,239
Linlang,

230
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,320
are you sure your uncle is in Mist Town?

231
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,840
Father only said that once I arrived in Mist Town,

232
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,400
my uncle would come to find me.

233
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,520
But I've been in Mist Town for so long,

234
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,239
and there's still no news of my uncle.

235
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,719
My older brother is the same.

236
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,559
No trace of him.

237
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,520
The previous clues

238
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,679
pointed to Mist Town.

239
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,960
I originally wanted to uncover

240
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,320
the truth behind the murder in my family.

241
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,080
I didn't expect

242
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,520
it would lead to so many other things.

243
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,159
Now,

244
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,760
thanks to Lord Geng's help,

245
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,840
we were able to take down that group of traffickers.

246
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,719
But I think this is far from over.

247
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,200
What do you think?

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,919
As far as I know,

249
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
Tianluo and Tang Clan

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,880
have both used drugged people for their operations.

251
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,159
The leader of the traffickers

252
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,359
also cooperated with Ye Mei because she was from Tianluo.

253
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,320
and worked with her.

254
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,159
This place belongs to Gushan.

255
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,159
So I think

256
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,440
Gushan

257
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
is very likely controlled by someone behind the scenes.

258
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,359
That makes sense.

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,239
After settling the people who were kidnapped by traffickers,

260
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
we'll head to Gushan.

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
to investigate.

262
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,239
Hmm.

263
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
But the person in charge of Gushan is very mysterious.

264
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,200
All we know is that their nickname is "Washerwoman."

265
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,039
Very few have seen their true face.

266
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,000
Washerwoman.

267
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,960
Such a formidable person

268
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,559
is actually an elderly woman.

269
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,520
To be able to control Gushan

270
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,719
and lead the most ruthless people in the martial world,

271
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
she must be highly skilled in martial arts

272
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,440
and physically strong.

273
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,400
If she really is an old woman,

274
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,599
I'd like to meet her.

275
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
You're interested in other women,

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,359
no matter if they're old or young,

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,239
but you're always picky with me.

278
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,440
These past two days,

279
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,280
why have you been so hostile toward me?

280
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,960
You blockhead,

281
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,359
even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

282
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,559
What does she mean by that?

283
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,640
Master Geng,

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,039
about this matter,

285
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,599
I can't explain it clearly to you either.

286
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,280
But what I do know now

287
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
is that students are really hard to manage.

288
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,520
What does he mean by that?

289
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,080
Suddenly I feel

290
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,280
that it's easier to be emotionless and loveless.

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,520
Stubborn blockhead.

292
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Blockhead

293
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,719
Stubborn fool

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,719
Stubborn fool

295
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,119
Doesn't understand anything

296
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,200
Who told you to follow me?

297
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,000
Why is it you?

298
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,960
Who did you think it was?

299
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,760
I didn't think it was anyone

300
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,559
Lord Geng Zhao is a good person

301
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,200
But in this regard

302
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,799
He’s still inexperienced

303
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,400
He needs more guidance from you

304
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,520
How should I guide him?

305
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,520
I've been standing for too long

306
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,080
My back is starting to hurt

307
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,280
Sister, come here

308
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:22,880
Sister

309
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,479
If you think this stool is uncomfortable

310
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,880
I'll go get you a cushion from inside

311
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,919
I had it specially brought from the capital

312
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,559
Sit down

313
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,679
Let me talk to you

314
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,080
Let me tell you

315
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,520
My family runs a coffin shop

316
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,760
Our house is really cramped

317
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,440
I sleep in a coffin every day

318
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,400
And sit on funeral paper

319
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,640
It's not that fancy

320
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,760
It's really uncomfortable

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
Look at you

322
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,679
You're with Lord Geng every day

323
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
He's always focused on solving cases

324
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,320
But you act like a spoiled princess

325
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,559
Of course he feels you're not on the same path

326
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,760
So he keeps avoiding you

327
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,479
Hmm

328
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,479
Makes sense

329
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,760
A playboy like Lu Jiu

330
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
Has seen all kinds of women

331
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,359
In the end, didn't you just end up admiring your sister?

332
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,960
Sister really is impressive.

333
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,119
Sister,

334
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,479
could you

335
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,839
give me some advice?

336
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,199
Do you really think I'm that capable?

337
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,439
Well, since you're so sincere,

339
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll give you some guidance.

340
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
The storybook says,

341
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,560
express your feelings through gifts.

342
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,800
First,

343
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,760
you should buy him a present.

344
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,040
Why are you quoting a storybook?

345
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,119
Weren't you going to share your own experience?

346
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,439
Are you just making this up?

347
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,959
Of course not.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,079
In this whole world,

349
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,719
it's because everyone does this.

350
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,199
Let me tell you,

351
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,239
men are often like children.

352
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,800
If you give him something nice,

353
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,760
he'll be absolutely delighted.

354
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
But as adults,

355
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,680
we see money as dirt.

356
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,839
How could we be so happy over little things?

357
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,079
That he'd show such obvious joy?

358
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,199
So Lu Jiu is also used to luxury.

359
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,280
But let me tell you,

360
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,880
last time I gave him and Sima Kong

361
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,000
each a scented pouch,

362
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,319
they even argued over whose looked better.

363
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,560
They almost got into a fight.

364
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah.

365
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,839
But what should I give him?

366
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,760
Of course, you should give him something he likes.

367
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,839
Just like me,

368
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,560
I like things related to dissection,

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,560
so I want dissection tools,

370
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,599
and chemicals that preserve corpses.

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,319
Now you should listen to me.

372
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,439
You won't go wrong.

373
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,079
Investing emotions in objects.

374
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,880
Is what Linlang said really reliable?

375
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,800
Why are you spacing out?

376
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,119
The turmoil in Mist Town has just settled.

377
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,560
The people are still fearful inside.

378
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,800
We need to patrol more to prevent any incidents.

379
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,400
Mm.

380
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,400
Let's look at the lanterns.

381
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,199
Master Geng,

382
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,199
This time, we owe it to the officials of the Diancha Department.

383
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,000
Our family was able to reunite.

384
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,760
This is all part of our duty.

385
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,160
Miss Xu Linlang is giving free medical consultations at a stall up ahead.

386
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,520
She's diagnosing injuries and illnesses for everyone.

387
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,719
After all, everyone stayed in that environment for so long.

388
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,160
We still need to be careful.

389
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
But I...

390
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,199
I've been away from home for a long time.

391
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,439
I haven't had any income for a while.

392
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,160
I'm afraid...

393
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't worry.

394
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,839
The Diancha Department is paying for this consultation.

395
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,520
You can go get treated without worry.

396
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,479
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

397
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Thank you, sir.

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,839
Let's go.

399
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,400
Linlang was right.

400
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,239
The official investigates cases wholeheartedly for the people.

401
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,239
If you cater to his interests, he'll surely be pleased.

402
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Sir

403
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,479
These are the major and suspicious cases from our dynasty over the years.

404
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,439
I've already organized them by year and case type.

405
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,680
I've sorted and categorized them.

406
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,800
This will make it easier for you to look them up.

407
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,839
Really.

408
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,280
There are just too many cases recorded in the archives.

409
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,239
It takes a lot of effort every time to look them up.

410
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,239
You've really done a great job this time.

411
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,959
It seems Linlang was right.

412
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,079
Catering to someone's preferences

413
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,599
is the only way to bring us closer.

414
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,119
Come, Baiyu, sit here.

415
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,000
You came so quickly.

416
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,160
I can't act too casually.

417
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,880
Forget it.

418
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,160
Beautiful.

419
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,359
This is how I usually dress.

420
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,680
You only noticed I'm beautiful today?

421
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,439
This case was handled beautifully.

422
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,359
If I were in charge of this case,

423
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,359
I might not have investigated it so thoroughly.

424
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,719
You—

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Didn't you say I—

426
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Say what about you?

427
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
I said you were thick-headed.

428
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,319
Did I say something wrong again?

429
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,199
What are you doing?

430
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,280
Why are you so angry?

431
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,199
It's all your fault.

432
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,040
You always look so happy whenever you get a gift.

433
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,000
Now Linlang thinks that's the secret to success.

434
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,119
Oh.

435
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,800
You didn't really give that case file

436
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,520
to Lord Geng, did you?

437
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,719
So what if I did?

438
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,640
Is my gift

439
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,199
really that bad?

440
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,400
It's not that your gift is bad.

441
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,199
You just picked the wrong mentor.

442
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,040
Lord Geng is a lot like Linlang.

443
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,160
Their minds are always on the case.

444
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
But then again,

445
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,599
if I hadn't given her some clever advice,

446
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,040
she still wouldn't have figured it out.

447
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,239
Come to think of it, she's actually pretty cute.

448
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,119
She thinks it was all her own doing.

449
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,920
Probably another self-proclaimed strategist.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,199
Sit down properly.

451
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,239
What do you mean, "self-proclaimed strategist"?

452
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,400
For the sake of my reputation,

453
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,439
I have to help you fulfill your wish today.

454
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,400
How are you planning to help me?

455
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,119
As the saying goes,

456
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,280
even the fiercest woman can't resist a persistent suitor.

457
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,319
When pursuing someone,

458
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,640
the key is to be bold yet careful.

459
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,160
At the right moment,

460
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,000
create some intimate

461
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,520
physical contact.

462
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,920
Get closer physically.

463
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,199
Isn't this

464
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,040
a bit too fast?

465
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,359
What are you thinking?

466
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,119
I mean just simple physical contact.

467
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,119
I still remember

468
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,319
back then,

469
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
when I was with Linlang,

470
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,239
trying to escape from our pursuers.

471
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,079
She carried me on her back

472
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
and ran through the forest.

473
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,959
I can still remember her heartbeat.

474
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,839
Thump thump.

475
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:24,520
Thump thump.

476
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,839
Thump thump.

477
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,359
Thump thump.

478
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,000
Thump thump.

479
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
Where is the lord?

480
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,239
My lord, are you alright?

481
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's go.

482
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,359
How is it?

483
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
Do you have a picture in your mind now?

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,920
Since what you said makes sense,

485
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,479
I'll trust you this time.

486
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,319
What are you up to now?

487
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,920
Look, I've shared everything I know to help you.

488
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,199
Shouldn't you

489
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,319
return the favor?

490
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,040
Go ahead,

491
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,199
how much do you want?

492
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,439
I'm not Sima Kong.

493
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,560
I don't want money.

494
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,959
I just want

495
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,000
to know how you girls

496
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,400
confess to a boy you like.

497
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,319
How do you confess your feelings?

498
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,079
Confess?

499
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,119
You and Linlang are already flirting so much.

500
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,920
Why do you need to confess?

501
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,000
That's different.

502
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,839
Even though we understand each other,

503
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
there's still a thin barrier between us.

504
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,319
I can't

505
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,119
expect her to make the first move.

506
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
Alright.

507
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm not someone who abandons others after getting help.

508
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,319
All girls

509
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,920
dream of the person they like

510
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,439
confessing their love in front of everyone.

511
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,359
Telling everyone about her feelings.

512
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,400
Linlang

513
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,880
would definitely love that too.

514
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,239
Alright.

515
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Let's do it that way.

516
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,520
Good luck.

517
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,839
Good luck.

518
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,839
Sir

519
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,199
Don't call me "Sir."

520
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,680
It sounds too distant.

521
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,319
From now on,

522
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,920
call me Zhaolang.

523
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,760
Sir

524
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,239
Why is it you?

525
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,560
Yours... Thank you, Miss Xu.

526
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
Thank you, Miss Xu. You're welcome.

527
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,119
Miss Xu

528
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,239
It's already late autumn.

529
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,000
How can there be osmanthus flowers?

530
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,680
Although the osmanthus blooming season is over,

531
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,160
I did it for you.

532
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,920
Lu Jiu, look at what you've done.

533
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,959
Ah!

534
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,319
No,

535
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,319
I didn't do anything wrong.

536
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,040
You think you didn't do anything wrong?

537
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:12,800
When they were locked up,

538
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,920
they took medicine that increases liver fire.

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,439
These osmanthus flowers will make their liver fire even stronger.

540
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,760
And you even sprinkled them into the medicine.

541
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,199
Stop right there! I really didn't know it would be like this.

542
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,920
I just wanted you to relive your memories.

543
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,599
Why is it so hard to understand?

544
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,959
It's all your fault.

545
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,839
Wasn't it your bad idea?

546
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,160
I've lost all my face.

547
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,839
And you still have the nerve to blame me?

548
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,839
I was so close with Linlang,

549
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,680
just one thin layer away.

550
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,040
Now look,

551
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,520
we're separated by several mountains.

552
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,239
Isn't it because you meddled for no reason?

553
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,680
You and Linlang have deep feelings for each other.

554
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,760
Everyone saw it.

555
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,199
You should confess openly like I did.

556
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,839
My situation

557
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
is something you don't understand.

558
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,040
Is there something we don't know about?

559
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,359
Before,

560
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,760
I was engaged to someone else.

561
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,119
Does Linlang know?

562
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,520
She knows.

563
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,359
It was that Nightshade who tried to assassinate me.

564
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,520
Oh.

565
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,599
That bad woman from Tianluo.

566
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,719
Then choosing Linlang over her is perfectly normal.

567
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
The key point

568
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,239
I used to be with Tianluo too.

569
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,920
So now you've turned over a new leaf, haven't you?

570
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,079
And you've also cut ties with that person called Yemei.

571
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,199
It's a clean break.

572
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,959
So what are you worried about now?

573
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,959
Actually,

574
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
my biggest concern

575
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
is that when I'm with Yemei,

576
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,520
I can feel

577
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,719
very relaxed.

578
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,719
But on the other hand,

579
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,920
When I'm with Linlang

580
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,199
I'm always afraid I'll say something wrong

581
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,079
and make her unhappy.

582
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,119
Also,

583
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,359
my unpredictable transformations

584
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
make it hard for me to even protect her safety.

585
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,520
So I...

586
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,119
Are you still thinking about that Night Demon?

587
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,599
So you want to use a confession to fool yourself and Linlang?

588
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,599
No.

589
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,359
I...

590
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,400
Sima Kong,

591
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,560
are you crazy?

592
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,319
That's right.

593
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,560
I am crazy.

594
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,319
If I weren't crazy,

595
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,680
how could I let someone like you have Linlang?

596
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,400
So you admit it.

597
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,400
What if I admit it?

598
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,640
What if I don't?

599
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,599
No matter what,

600
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,640
I won't let you deceive Linlang while thinking of another woman.

601
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,800
and lie to her.

602
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,239
I'm not.

603
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,400
Wait, wait, wait.

604
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,560
You like Linlang too.

605
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,520
You've known this all along.

606
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,599
We're still brothers.

607
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,920
In the end, you gave up for your brother.

608
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,359
How touching.

609
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,880
I didn't do it for him.

610
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,439
From beginning to end,

611
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,359
I only want Linlang to be happy.

612
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,760
Every one of her smiles

613
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,000
is etched in my heart.

614
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,160
Every tear

615
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,599
falls on my pain.

616
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,359
As long as she's happy

617
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,680
it doesn't matter who she chooses.

618
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,920
As long as

619
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,359
she's happy,

620
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,760
I understand.

621
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,520
I understand.

622
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,319
I understand.

623
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,719
Thank you, Brother Sima.

624
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,160
Are you really planning to let Linlang go to him?

625
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,760
I just said,

626
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,040
as long as she's happy,

627
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,920
then I'm happy too.

628
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,599
Why did you bring me here?

629
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,280
You were causing trouble all day.

630
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,160
Now,

631
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,160
I've been giving free consultations all day. I want to rest.

632
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,719
Come on, give it to me.

633
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,959
Just leave these things alone.

634
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,839
I want to show you something properly.

635
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,760
Look.

636
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,359
Because you wiped out the human traffickers,

637
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,199
they can now be with their families.

638
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,719
Living in harmony.

639
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,439
You're a hero.

640
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,439
You're a hero too.

641
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Since we're both heroes,

642
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:50,119
shouldn't we celebrate properly?

643
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,239
Geng Zhao goes to the Inspection Office.

644
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,839
One person becomes an official.

645
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,599
So that evil cannot flourish.

646
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,119
Alright, alright.

647
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,239
That was wonderful, alright.

648
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,439
Come, let's look over there.

649
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,079
How much is this?

650
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,160
Here, for you.

651
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,599
This bustling street life,

652
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
is the most beautiful scene in the world.

653
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,959
Yes, it is.

654
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,079
We met

655
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,599
in the marketplace.

656
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
In hardship,

657
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,560
it was also in the marketplace.

658
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,000
Linlang

659
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,400
Before,

660
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,359
I cared too much about the past.

661
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,719
So,

662
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,599
I was always walking on thin ice,

663
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,800
being extremely cautious.

664
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,800
Even when I was with Yemei,

665
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,760
I felt a bit more at ease.

666
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,400
Your marriage to Miss Yemei

667
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,640
I’ve known about it for a long time.

668
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,800
You don’t need to remind me again.

669
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,160
I’m the unnecessary one.

670
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,599
You misunderstood what I meant.

671
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,160
What I wanted to say is,

672
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,520
the reason I’m so careful with you

673
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
is because

674
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,959
I care about you even more.

675
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Every move you make,

676
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,520
tugs at my heartstrings.

677
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,119
You are, in my whole life,

678
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,520
the person I care about most.

679
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
Linlang,

680
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,400
would you be willing

681
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,479
to join hands with me

682
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,400
and spend the rest of our lives together?
