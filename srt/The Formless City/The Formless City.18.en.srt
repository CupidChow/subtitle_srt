1
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
Fenglei Hall has never rebelled.

2
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
It was Li Chu and Dugu Wumo who conspired together.

3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,959
They falsely claimed that Master Luo possessed the Wuxiang treasure.

4
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,600
And that it would threaten the court and the nation.

5
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,000
In fact,

6
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,399
they are the ones who want to seize the treasure.

7
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,520
Li Chu

8
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,000
In order to gain the master's trust back then,

9
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,479
he hid the fact that he was already married with children.

10
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,960
He proposed to me.

11
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
I was confused at the time.

12
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,199
By the time I saw his true nature,

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,559
I was already pregnant with his child.

14
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,119
Madam, look.

15
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
The young master is so adorable.

16
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,199
But when you were born,

17
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,559
he took you away.

18
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,800
As a hostage.

19
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,759
He handed you over to Tianluo's leader, Dugu.

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
What are you doing?

21
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,199
What are you doing?

22
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,320
Give me the child.

23
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,479
Give the child back to me.

24
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,399
Give him to me.

25
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,639
Give him back to me.

26
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,679
Madam.

27
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,800
What are you doing?

28
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,960
Give the child back to me.

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,479
Give him back to me.

30
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,199
Give me the child.

31
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,119
Give him to me.

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,160
I managed to escape.

33
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I searched everywhere for news of you.

34
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,199
This separation

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
lasted twenty years.

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
So,

37
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,199
you never thought of abandoning me?

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
What mother in this world

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
would ever leave her own child?

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Senior,

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,240
please don't blame me for being cautious.

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,759
It's just that we can't believe everything based on your word alone.

43
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,000
and trust it completely.

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Since you said

45
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,639
that for over ten years

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,440
you've been searching for Lu Jiu without success,

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
then why, upon hearing Lu Jiu's identity,

48
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,839
did you immediately want to verify his birthmark?

49
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,119
A few months ago,

50
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,320
I noticed someone was secretly trafficking people and corpses.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,559
While gathering clues,

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,679
I accidentally discovered

53
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,399
that the Lu family in Luoyang County

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,839
had purchased two corpses.

55
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,320
They used them for a body double escape.

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,839
The mastermind behind this

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,320
was actually Li Chu.

58
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,920
So that means

59
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
Lu Jiu is not the Lu family's biological child.

60
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,480
Then seven years ago,

61
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,799
when Lu Jiu was still Fei Ying and suddenly lost his memory,

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,640
how did he end up being found by the Lu family?

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm completely confused by all this.

64
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,040
First it's Li Chu,

65
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,640
then it's the Lu family.

66
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,200
What on earth is going on?

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
The head of the Lu family, Lu Kun,

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
is actually Li Chu

69
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,399
using an alias to hide his identity.

70
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,640
Li Chu

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,359
Under the protection of Tianluo

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
He concealed his identity as Lukun

73
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,519
But was secretly searching

74
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,239
For the imprisoned former members of Fengleitang

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,880
Hoping to find clues to the whereabouts of the Wuxiang Treasure

76
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,959
So, in that case

77
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,760
Tianluo and Li Chu

78
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,239
Raised Lu Jiu together

79
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,480
In order to search for the Wuxiang Treasure

80
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,079
But why, in the past seven years

81
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,839
Did they hide Lu Jiu in Luoyang County

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
Yet never took any action

83
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,959
The imperial court

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Back then, Tianluo led his forces to eliminate Fengleitang

85
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,000
Under the pretense of a court-sanctioned campaign against bandits

86
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,720
But afterwards

87
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,760
No clues to the Wuxiang Treasure were found

88
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,440
Because of this, His Majesty

89
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,239
Became wary of Tianluo

90
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,040
So he secretly sent the Dianchasi to investigate again

91
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,119
That's right

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,200
Whoever obtains the Wuxiang Treasure can rule the world

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,679
Seven years ago

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,519
Rumors spread widely in the underworld

95
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,320
Fei Ying

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,760
Had obtained the key clue to the Wuxiang Treasure

97
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,119
For a time

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,559
All factions focused their attention on him

99
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,000
But on his way back to report to Tianluo

100
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,640
While passing through Wu Town

101
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
He suddenly disappeared

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,200
So they

103
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,119
Didn't avoid seeking clues from Lu Jiu

104
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,480
But were afraid of the imperial court

105
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,239
Discovering their true intentions

106
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,200
So they endured in silence for seven years

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
Waiting for the underworld to calm down

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
Before stirring up trouble again

109
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,359
Everything was part of their plan.

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,079
Unfortunately,

111
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,839
some unexpected events occurred.

112
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:50,920
Geng,

113
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,559
that person discovered something was wrong with the Lu family.

114
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,079
He secretly arrived in Luoyang County.

115
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:01,119
But Lu Mingcheng fled in a panic.

116
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,959
That's why he exposed himself.

117
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Since Lu Jiu's memories from seven years ago are so important,

118
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,600
why did someone still poison him in prison?

119
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,880
That wasn't poison.

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,239
It was a drug that induces fake death.

121
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,079
It's the same principle as Lu Mingcheng's escape.

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Shedding one's shell to escape.

123
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,720
How did you know?

124
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,839
Do you think our Investigation Bureau is incompetent?

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,880
That person managed to get you on the road,

126
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
but secretly protected you.

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,720
The purpose was to follow you,

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
and find the mastermind behind all this.

129
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,399
So,

130
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,239
from the very beginning in Luoyang County,

131
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,440
this was all a setup.

132
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,839
The current situation

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,239
is far too complicated.

134
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,559
The masterminds include Tianluo,

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,679
Li Chu,

136
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,239
and even

137
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,160
the Tang Clan.

138
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't look at me like that.

139
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,239
Our Tang Clan seeks the Wuxiang treasure

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,519
for weapon blueprints

141
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,720
and skill manuals.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,320
If I say

143
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,119
the Tang Clan loves wealth,

144
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,720
but values craftsmanship even more,

145
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,959
would you believe me?

146
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,399
We believe you.

147
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,279
When I had him imprisoned,

148
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
he took drugs that disturbed his mind.

149
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,839
He confessed everything in detail.

150
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,440
Did I say anything else?

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Everyone has a reason.

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,399
Only I

153
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,760
am a tool that no one cares about.

154
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,960
Your friends have all settled in.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,320
You can stay here without worry.

156
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,200
If you need anything, just tell me.

157
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Mm.

158
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,080
This...

159
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,119
All of these are...

160
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,200
Over the years,

161
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,039
Even though I couldn't find any trace of you,

162
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I always felt

163
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,880
that one day you would come back.

164
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,159
Every year, I would add a few

165
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,559
things that someone your age might like.

166
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,840
Without realizing it, I accumulated so many.

167
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
Are you saying

168
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,520
this room

169
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,840
was prepared for me all along?

170
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
Now that you’re grown up,

171
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,400
you probably don’t like these childish things anymore.

172
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,039
I didn’t have time to tidy up today.

173
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,559
I’ll have someone move them right away— No need.

174
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,239
These things

175
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,000
I actually like them.

176
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,000
They’re fine staying here.

177
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,520
I’m glad you like them.

178
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,840
I’m the younger one here.

179
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
You don’t have to be so formal with me.

180
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,159
I’m not just being polite.

181
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,919
I just never thought

182
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
that something I’ve been longing for over twenty years

183
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,239
would suddenly come true one day.

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,679
Jiu’er, you being able to come back

185
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,400
and stay by my side forever

186
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,119
makes me truly happy.

187
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,039
I...

188
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,320
I’m a bit tired.

189
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
I didn’t think it through.

190
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,479
You should rest for now.

191
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,559
We haven’t seen each other in twenty years.

192
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,719
Some things don’t need to be rushed.

193
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,719
No need to rush.

194
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,599
I haven't slept on such a comfortable bed in ages.

195
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
It's almost as nice as the one I have at home in the capital.

196
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,080
That old laundress—

197
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,799
No, I mean Madam Xu Xiang.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,359
For Lu Jiu's sake,

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
she's been quite generous to us.

200
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,479
Hey, what's wrong?

201
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,080
Lu Jiu found his birth mother.

202
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,400
Aren't you happy for him?

203
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,919
Of course I'm happy for him.

204
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,400
It's just that—

205
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,159
He suddenly learned that his real father is a villain.

206
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,000
And even used him as a bargaining chip in a deal with Tian Luo.

207
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,280
In his heart,

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,760
he must be feeling terrible.

209
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,520
That's true.

210
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,239
To suddenly find out

211
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,119
that none of your family truly cares about you—

212
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,400
Anyone in his place

213
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,520
would be heartbroken.

214
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
You can't sleep because something's on your mind, right?

215
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,640
My father used to really love drinking too.

216
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,359
But

217
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,000
he only drank when he was happy.

218
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,840
Drinking to drown your sorrows only makes you feel worse.

219
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,799
Drinking when you're upset

220
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,760
just wastes the true flavor of the wine.

221
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,880
It's not like I don't understand that.

222
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,599
But right now, only wine

223
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,599
can help me forget all my troubles.

224
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,919
Do you remember

225
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,799
at the slave auction,

226
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,400
I casually lied and said

227
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,119
I was from the Xu family of Gushan.

228
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,039
I never expected

229
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,799
that it would actually turn out to be true.

230
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,679
You can look at the bright side.

231
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,479
Before,

232
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,280
you always blamed your father's indifference

233
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
on your own mistakes.

234
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
But now,

235
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,000
you know your father and brother

236
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,840
never truly saw you as family.

237
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,239
So you don't have to feel sad for them anymore.

238
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
Even so,

239
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,919
after knowing them for so many years,

240
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,520
realizing you've just been used

241
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,239
is really painful.

242
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't even know

243
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,159
who truly cares about me

244
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,359
and who is just pretending.

245
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,520
I can't vouch for anyone else,

246
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,400
but

247
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,559
no matter what happens,

248
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,119
I'll always be by your side.

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,479
In this life,

250
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,599
meeting you

251
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,559
is the luckiest thing that's ever happened to me.

252
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,239
Why

253
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,960
do I feel that escorting the young master

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,799
and Miss Xu is a completed mission

255
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,840
so I quietly leave after accomplishing my task

256
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,039
Their purpose for this trip

257
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,880
was to uncover the secret of their origins

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
Now they have found the answer

259
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
I have no reason

260
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
to stay here anymore

261
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,599
Is that so

262
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,840
When I saw you fighting others at the restaurant

263
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,359
I sensed something was off about you

264
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,280
When I first captured you

265
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,520
considering your strong martial arts skills

266
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,520
I even ordered extra medicine to be used on you

267
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,760
to suppress your martial arts

268
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,359
But why do you have no martial arts now

269
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,960
What if you know martial arts?

270
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,760
And what if you don't?

271
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,520
I actually feel

272
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,760
more at ease now.

273
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,039
I heard that a few days ago, the young chief

274
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
was poisoned while rescuing someone who was kidnapped

275
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,919
and was afflicted with an incurable poison.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,760
He nearly lost his life.

277
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,320
It was you who found the antidote at the last moment.

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,320
That's when you lost your martial arts skills.

279
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't worry.

280
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,719
This was all my own choice.

281
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,799
It wasn't for Lu Jiu

282
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,119
that I gave up my martial arts.

283
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,799
Miss Xing'er,

284
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,599
there's no need to take credit for me in front of Master Xu Xiang.

285
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,799
You're doing this for the person who gave you the scented sachet, aren't you?

286
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,039
Don't forget,

287
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
I know everything about you.

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,119
It's so late,

289
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,679
is he still going out?

290
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,640
Let's go take a look.

291
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,599
Mm.

292
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880
When you were kidnapped, you were delirious,

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,320
but you still treasured this sachet above all else.

294
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
That's when I realized

295
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
that the person who gave you this sachet

296
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,159
is very important to you.

297
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,960
Linlang, to me,

298
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
is just a friend.

299
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,039
A friend?

300
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,599
Anyone can see that's not true.

301
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,719
You're always protecting her.

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,320
You even risked everything to save Young Master Lu Jiu

303
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,679
and lost your martial arts for it.

304
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,599
All just to make Miss Xu smile.

305
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,200
My dear Xing'er

306
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,080
Don't be angry, you're the only one in my heart

307
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,239
As for Linlang,

308
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,719
she's just a friend to me

309
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
What are you doing?

310
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,320
You men never say anything true

311
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,719
You and I, in that dark place

312
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,039
lived and died together

313
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,760
It was you, time and again

314
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,719
who saved me from danger

315
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,760
From that moment on

316
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,039
you've lived in my heart

317
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Isn't this just acting?

318
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,880
Do you have to be so cheesy?

319
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
They're still outside the door

320
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,719
My dear Xing'er

321
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,359
Please forgive me this time

322
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,119
There's truly only you in my heart

323
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,959
Believe me

324
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,239
The moonlight is really beautiful tonight

325
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,199
We

326
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,319
We're here to invite you to enjoy the moon with us

327
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,599
That's right

328
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,959
Our Xing'er

329
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,439
loves moon-gazing the most

330
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,359
Your Xing'er, huh

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,520
I haven't forgiven you yet

332
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,160
Stop grinning like that

333
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,439
Acting like this is harder than being undercover

334
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,199
Brother

335
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,479
Not bad

336
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,920
Getting rich quietly

337
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
When did you and Miss Xing'er

338
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,079
fall for each other?

339
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,119
Alright, alright

340
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,719
Stop teasing Sima Kong

341
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm really happy you found someone you love

342
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm truly happy for you

343
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,599
Thank you

344
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,839
Um

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,719
Linlang

346
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,880
Just now, Miss Xing'er

347
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,160
was so shy

348
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,319
Go check on her

349
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,000
and explain to her

350
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,800
that we didn't eavesdrop on purpose

351
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,280
You're always so thoughtful

352
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,400
I'll go right now

353
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,719
Are you really together with Xing'er?

354
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:28,880
You two are dating now?

355
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,760
Why?

356
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,479
Is it only you who gets to find someone you love,

357
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,040
and I'm not allowed to find my own happiness?

358
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,199
Stop changing the subject.

359
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,920
That punch you gave me last time,

360
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,000
I still remember it.

361
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
It's obvious

362
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,400
you still have Linlang in your heart.

363
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,119
That's right.

364
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,959
I did like Linlang before.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
But that was in the past.

366
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,959
I'm a businessman.

367
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,400
I never make losing deals.

368
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:47,520
Since I know Linlang likes you,

369
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,079
why should I keep clinging to her?

370
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,719
Of course, I should cut my losses in time.

371
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,839
And look for someone else.

372
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,520
Brother, no, no, that's not okay.

373
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,520
You treated us the day before yesterday.

374
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,719
And you treated us again yesterday.

375
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
Now you want to treat us again today.

376
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,400
You know it's not right to let a brother pay every time.

377
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,439
No, no, that's not okay.

378
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,479
Chief Xu is here.

379
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,719
Let me treat you to some tea.

380
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Please, Chief Xu.

381
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,719
Brother, I have to be the one to treat this time.

382
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,199
We agreed I'd treat, why are you doing this again?

383
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,680
I'll pay.

384
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,040
Has your broken arm from last time still not healed?

385
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,160
I lost this arm more than ten years ago.

386
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,040
Last time, that was my prosthetic.

387
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,520
It's already been sent for repairs.

388
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,920
That's right, that's right.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,160
The prosthetic got damaged last time.

390
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,520
I should be the one treating this meal.

391
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Alright, alright.

392
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,400
I just found my son, so I'm in a good mood.

393
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,359
Today's tea

394
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,079
should be my treat.

395
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,040
Thank you, Chief Xu. Thank you, Chief Xu.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,119
Take care, Chief Xu.

397
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,599
Take care. Alright.

398
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,359
They

399
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,920
all know your real name?

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
Aren't you always secretive?

401
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,119
Hardly anyone has seen your real face, right?

402
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
I've never hidden my identity.

403
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,040
They do it to protect my safety.

404
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
That's why they keep it secret.

405
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,439
As for the nickname "Washerwoman,"

406
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,560
when Gushan was first founded,

407
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,239
most of the refugees from the martial world were rough men.

408
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,400
They didn't know how to take care of daily life.

409
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,040
I often helped them with their laundry.

410
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,800
Chief Xu is compassionate.

411
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,719
That's why you're so respected.

412
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,319
But

413
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,920
are you wondering

414
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,000
why I shelter and protect these

415
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,719
fearsome-looking outlaws?

416
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,520
Please enlighten me, Chief Xu.

417
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,719
Don't be fooled by their intimidating appearance.

418
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,599
They're actually good people.

419
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,160
Good people?

420
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,479
Those two just now—

421
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,280
Although I wrongly accused them,

422
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,439
but the day we arrived at Gushan,

423
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,359
we clearly saw someone selling their child to gamble.

424
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Look.

425
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,439
That's Lao Liu.

426
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,199
His youngest son lacks ambition.

427
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,880
He spends his days stealing and sneaking around.

428
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,719
He refuses to live an honest life.

429
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,400
So he came to me, asking for help to stage a play.

430
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,400
To let that child see

431
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,880
the consequences of living recklessly.

432
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,239
Now it seems

433
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
it has worked.

434
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,920
I see.

435
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,199
That sculpture made from human bones

436
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,040
must be like those villains who were auctioned off.

437
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,119
They got what they deserved.

438
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
So,

439
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,400
they are all pitiful people who can only take refuge here.

440
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,160
Then why is Gushan rumored to be so terrifying outside?

441
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
It must be because the current emperor values balance.

442
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,400
Tianluo and Dianchasi keep each other in check.

443
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,239
After Fengleitang was destroyed,

444
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,719
the martial world fell into chaos.

445
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,319
Only by giving Gushan a bad reputation

446
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,959
this way,

447
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,119
can the turmoil be temporarily eased.

448
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
and the conflicts among the factions be held back.

449
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,040
Right?

450
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,560
They really are pitiful.

451
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,000
They just wanted to live peacefully here.

452
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,560
But outsiders spread false rumors about them.

453
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,479
Ruining their reputation.

454
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,319
Now that you know the truth,

455
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,560
my years of struggling to support Gushan have not been in vain.

456
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,319
No.

457
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,800
We must find a way to change all this.

458
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,000
Mother,

459
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,719
if you can trust me,

460
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,479
I am willing to help you

461
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,760
turn Gushan

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,640
into a paradise

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,920
that everyone in the martial world dreams of.

464
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Good.

465
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,640
Good child.

466
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,560
Mother has been waiting to see this day.

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,400
Father.

468
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,719
Our informant at Gushan sent word that

469
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,520
he has actually settled down at Gushan.

470
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,560
He even said

471
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,560
he wants to turn Gushan

472
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,920
into a paradise that everyone in the martial world dreams of.

473
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,760
Father.

474
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,079
If this continues,

475
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,319
the secret of the Wuxiang treasure

476
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,520
when will it ever see the light of day again?

477
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,880
You're so impatient.

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,640
How can you accomplish anything big?

479
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,800
The more relaxed a person is,

480
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,239
the easier it is to reveal their flaws.

481
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,319
What have you been busy with these past few days?

482
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,239
So busy you don't even have time to eat.

483
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,959
Drink this porridge first.

484
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,400
By the way,

485
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,560
Look,

486
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,760
this is

487
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,400
the sketch I designed for Gushan Academy.

488
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,800
Academy.

489
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
I understand now.

490
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,280
You want to enlighten and educate the people of Gushan.

491
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,040
Yes.

492
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,839
That's right.

493
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:26,880
The reason people in the martial world misunderstand Gushan

494
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:27,800
is because

495
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,839
they only remember it for fighting and killing.

496
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
They don't understand culture or literature.

497
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,959
Only by studying

498
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,040
can they

499
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,400
understand meaning and reason.

500
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,560
Express what they think and feel.

501
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,359
Lu Jiu,

502
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,319
you're really starting to show the qualities of a young leader.

503
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,319
What young leader?

504
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,359
It's just that

505
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,880
after so many years away from my mother's side,

506
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,760
I just want to share more of her burdens.

507
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,640
Linlang

508
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,439
Not only will I

509
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,239
take responsibility for the future of Gushan,

510
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,359
but also for your future.

511
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,439
My future?

512
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,040
Yes.

513
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,119
Here in Gushan,

514
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,920
although people don't pick up things lost on the road,

515
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,800
and doors are left open at night,

516
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
and there are no cases to investigate,

517
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,680
but

518
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,920
you can help me manage Gushan together.

519
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,199
This is your home too.

520
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
You...

521
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
Are you missing your father?

522
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,959
I...

523
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,959
I've been thinking about him lately.

524
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,959
Even my memories of Fei Ying don't come up often anymore.

525
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,479
As for my father and elder brother,

526
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,920
I don't want to look for them anymore.

527
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,319
Let's just stay here in Gushan,

528
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
and live a carefree life.

529
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:46,719
Is that okay?

530
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,479
Okay.

531
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,680
What is that?

532
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,880
It's nothing.

533
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,680
That's a tool for the academy model.

534
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,000
Um...

535
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,040
It's getting late.

536
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,359
Let's go back and rest.

537
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,160
By the way,

538
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,239
It's chilly now.

539
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,760
Be careful not to catch a cold.

540
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Linlang,

541
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,439
The scent on you

542
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,719
seems even more fragrant than before.

543
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,119
What fragrance?

544
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,640
Did you forget what I said before?

545
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,520
Your scent is different from others.

546
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,079
Maybe you were busy with cases before,

547
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,599
and the scent was masked by the smell of corpses.

548
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,160
But lately,

549
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,920
the fragrance has become more noticeable.

550
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,319
There's no such fragrance.

551
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,560
It must be the scent from that incense burner.

552
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,319
Incense burner?

553
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,439
I'll head back first.

554
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,599
Get some good rest.

555
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,280
How could he know

556
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,959
that my scent used to be from working as a coroner,

557
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
the mark of investigating cases.

558
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,680
Even though Father made scented pills to suppress it,

559
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,400
it couldn't be completely removed.

560
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,560
But now,

561
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,599
I no longer have the chance to pursue my ambitions.

562
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,760
This is your lonely mountain,

563
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,920
but it's not mine.

564
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:38,920
Su Shi once wrote in a poem,

565
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,479
Who would choose to dwell on a lonely, desolate mountain?

566
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,119
But if one has the Way, the mountain is not lonely.

567
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,599
Paper windows and a bamboo house bring warmth within.

568
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,119
Wrapped in a coarse robe, sitting and sleeping on a round mat.

569
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,280
Today,

570
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,040
marks the official opening of Gushan Academy.

571
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,680
It is named "Not Alone Academy".

572
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,959
May the world never be lonely.

573
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,359
May all beings help one another.

574
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,520
Good, good.

575
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,520
Very good.

576
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,160
Lu Jiu always used to say

577
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,719
that his life was meaningless.

578
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,119
Everything he did

579
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,800
was just to be closer to his father and brother.

580
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:05,880
But now,

581
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,880
he has finally found his own path in life.

582
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,359
Lu Jiu has truly grown a lot.

583
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,520
Even I can't help but admire him.

584
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,319
It's truly enviable.

585
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,599
What did you say?

586
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,560
I said I'm really happy for him.

587
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,640
The sesame cake fell on the ground.

588
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,760
Father can't take it to give as a New Year's gift now.

589
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,479
Little one, get up first.

590
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Don't cry.

591
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,479
I'll take all these sesame cakes.

592
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,479
Really.

593
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Could it be that you are the one mentioned in the storybooks,

594
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,800
the great benefactor who helps the world and does good deeds?

595
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,880
I'm not a great benefactor.

596
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,479
But I do my best

597
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,880
to keep this peaceful world going.

598
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,359
Thank you, kind benefactor.

599
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,560
I, Geng Zhao, have investigated cases for the people all my life.

600
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,239
In the end, I was punished for protecting the people of the isolated city.

601
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,160
I suppose I died for a worthy cause.

602
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,040
It's just that

603
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,439
I don't know how she is now.

604
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,239
Sir,

605
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,479
Could it be

606
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,199
that I've been thinking about her too much lately?

607
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,599
Sir,

608
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,719
Sir,

609
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,119
Sir,

610
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,359
Sir,

611
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,439
I miss you so much.

612
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,520
I knew you wouldn't leave me behind.

613
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,479
Let go.

614
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,359
How improper to behave like this in public.

615
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,800
She just hasn't seen you for a long time.

616
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,280
Couldn't hold back for a moment?

617
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,959
We are in a superior-subordinate relationship.

618
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,000
No matter when or where,

619
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,839
you must always remember your status.

620
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,439
We've been through so many hardships together.

621
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
And when I was in Mist Town,

622
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,640
I made myself very clear.

623
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,479
Yet you still only see me as a subordinate.

624
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,239
From the day you joined the Investigation Bureau,

625
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,400
I warned you.

626
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,560
If you have thoughts beyond solving cases,

627
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,599
I'll send you back to the capital.

628
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,319
No need to trouble Lord Geng.

629
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:31,959
I, Bai Yu, am well aware.

630
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,880
Ever since I came to you as a princess,

631
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
you've disliked me.

632
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,280
Don't worry.

633
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,199
From now on,

634
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,119
I will never appear by your side again.

635
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,400
Nor will I let my true feelings be trampled again.

636
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,640
Everyone, eat and drink well!

637
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
Drink plenty!

638
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,719
Lord Wang.

639
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,520
Chief Xu.

640
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,040
The construction of the academy this time is all thanks to you.

641
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,119
I offer you a toast.

642
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,719
Come, come!

643
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,839
Eat well and drink well.

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,239
It's hard to bear sadness alone.

645
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,160
No one will feel sorry for you.

646
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,760
Where are you going?

647
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm going back to the capital.

648
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,239
Did Lord Geng ask you to go back?

649
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't mention him to me.

650
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,280
Right now,

651
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,959
I have nothing to do with him.

652
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,479
Linlang,

653
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,839
Let me tell you,

654
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,959
Men will never see

655
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,479
the sacrifices we make for them.

656
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,199
Women should live for themselves.

657
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,000
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

658
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,599
If you want to play dumb,

659
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,640
then keep pretending.

660
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I'm leaving.

661
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Eat well and drink well.

662
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,319
Come on, let's go over there and take a look.

663
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,400
Come, let me offer you a toast.

664
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,359
Linlang's mood has been off lately.

665
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:22,719
If you care about her,

666
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,239
then go comfort her.

667
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,079
Forget it.

668
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,520
What she wants

669
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,359
has never been my comfort.

670
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,920
You always act sharp-tongued and cold.

671
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,920
But after all this, you only know how to endure in silence.

672
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,319
And you dragged me into it too.

673
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,680
Honestly, you...

674
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,520
Forget it.

675
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,959
This is all I can do to help you.

676
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,199
Thank you, thank you.

677
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,680
Miss Xu

678
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Why are you just looking and not eating?

679
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,719
Is the food not to your taste?

680
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,599
What would you like to eat?

681
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,400
We can have the kitchen make something else for you.

682
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,359
And you two are?

683
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,119
We are the most famous matchmakers in Gushan.

684
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,439
Just call me Third Aunt.

685
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:25,560
Call me—

686
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,239
Just call me Sixth Granny.

687
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,359
Third Aunt and Sixth Granny.

688
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,239
You really live up to your names.

689
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,400
We’re very good at judging people.

690
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,800
All the young ladies in town

691
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,479
hope that Young Master Lu will choose them.

692
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,000
If you ask us,

693
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,239
Young Master Lu Jiu

694
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,680
will definitely marry no one but you.

695
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,400
That’s right.

696
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,920
Why are we talking about marriage?

697
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,640
I haven’t thought that far ahead.

698
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,359
It’s not far off.

699
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,280
Young Master Lu is already twenty this year.

700
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,160
Get married in spring, have a child by the end of the year.

701
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,199
By the time the child grows up, you’ll still be in your prime.

702
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,839
You can even help your son with his future.

703
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
Isn’t that right?

704
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,280
I think, although your hips are a bit small,

705
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,119
your build is strong.

706
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,719
You’re definitely good material for having children.

707
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,560
I guarantee

708
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,520
within three years,

709
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,479
you’ll surely have two children.

710
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,959
No problem at all.

711
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,400
I haven't thought that far ahead.

712
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,280
I just want to teach well at the academy.

713
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,479
A woman's main role is to support her husband and raise children.

714
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,719
Why bother teaching?

715
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,239
Besides, here in Gushan,

716
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,719
there hasn't been a murder in twenty years.

717
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,760
Why learn autopsy like a coroner?

718
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,040
These academy classes

719
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,160
are arranged by Young Master Lu Jiu.

720
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,119
He was worried you'd be bored.

721
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,439
They're just to keep you entertained.

722
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
That's right.

723
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,760
But that's not what Lu Jiu said.

724
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,680
Even if Young Master Lu is the heir, I have to say this.

725
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,640
Before marriage,

726
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,680
men will say whatever sounds nice.

727
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,520
Isn't that true?

728
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,000
Let me tell you, after marriage,

729
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,359
he'll definitely want you to be a good wife.

730
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,239
All those promises he made before

731
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,479
were just on a whim.

732
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,119
They won't last long.
