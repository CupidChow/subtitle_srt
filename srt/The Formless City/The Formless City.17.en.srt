1
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,319
Um

2
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
You go first.

3
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,400
Or should you go first?

4
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Today

5
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,479
is the happiest day

6
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,839
of my entire life.

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,919
Me too.

8
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,320
Sir

9
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,000
Buy a sky lantern for your lady.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,600
Today is the Sky Lantern Festival.

11
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,279
Lovers release sky lanterns together

12
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,720
to ensure everlasting happiness.

13
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,119
I got it wrong again.

14
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,080
Today is my first time selling sky lanterns.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,759
I’ve asked several people and got it wrong each time.

16
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,440
Looks like I won’t be able to sell this lantern.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,479
Little one

18
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,360
I’ll take all these lanterns.

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
She and I

20
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,800
She and I

21
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,039
will definitely

22
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
be happy for a lifetime.

23
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
Here, for you.

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,520
Thank you.

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,440
Wishing you and your lady everlasting love.

26
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,639
And may you have children soon.

27
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,919
Who’s your lady?

28
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,639
Just now,

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,919
it was just a kid, so I...

30
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,240
I know.

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,039
You were just worried she wouldn’t sell all her lanterns

32
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,399
and would be punished when she got home.

33
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,759
That’s why you helped her.

34
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,399
So we don’t need to release the lanterns now, right?

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
No, no, we have to.

36
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,520
We must release them.

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,440
Didn’t you say

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,919
if you spend money

39
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,880
and don’t use it, it’s a waste?

40
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,919
Shameful.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,759
It's a pity

42
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,800
that only here has the Sky Lantern Festival.

43
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,800
I don't know when

44
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,039
I'll be able to see such a beautiful sight again.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,720
Although only here has the Sky Lantern Festival,

46
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,839
other places

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,399
have the Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

48
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,520
I promise you,

49
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,039
no matter where we go in the future,

50
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,199
I'll always go with you.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,399
To the Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

52
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,520
Then you can't go back on your word.

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,639
Why would I go back on my word?

54
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,199
It's my honor.

55
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,960
Come on, let's go release the lanterns.

56
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,839
Let's go.

57
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,639
I bet those two

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,000
are probably releasing sky lanterns right now.

59
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,360
I heard from the people in town

60
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,119
that during their Sky Lantern Festival

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
if lovers release sky lanterns together,

62
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,399
they'll be happy together forever.

63
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,519
That's really enviable.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,559
Yeah.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
It really is enviable.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,239
Even you, with your icy face,

67
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,839
feel envy sometimes.

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
We're both unlucky people,

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,720
do we really need to hurt each other?

70
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,320
True.

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,079
What if a sky lantern actually falls down on us,

72
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,200
what should we do?

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,119
What else can we do?

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll block it for you.

75
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,559
You may look cold as ice,

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,399
but you're surprisingly warm-hearted.

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Thanks.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,920
Two taels of silver.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I was just making an example, and you want two taels of silver?

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,440
You're way too mercenary.

81
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,519
I wasted my sympathy on you just now.

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,399
Fine.

83
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,559
Half price, then.

84
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,799
So our friendship

85
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:10,839
is only worth one tael of silver?

86
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,519
You, the assistant apprentice of Dianchasi,

87
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,160
were threatening to beat and kill us just a few days ago.

88
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,720
Is there even any friendship between us?

89
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,600
Good point.

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,559
Cheers.

91
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,200
To two disappointed people.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,959
It's getting late.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
You should head back soon.

94
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,000
Sir,

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,079
are you going out?

96
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,799
Yes.

97
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,519
Sir

98
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,880
Where are you going so late?

99
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,239
I have important business to attend to.

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
Sir

101
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,559
Are you angry?

102
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,320
Are you jealous?

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,959
Who’s jealous?

104
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,799
What important business could there be this late?

105
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,480
My thoughts these past few days

106
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,839
surely haven’t escaped your notice.

107
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,119
I might as well be direct.

108
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,920
I’ve admired you for a long time.

109
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,000
Ever since I joined the Diancha Office,

110
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:33,679
In the past,

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,200
I know you were young and playful.

112
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,119
But now we work together at the Diancha Office.

113
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,279
Jokes like this

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
shouldn’t be made anymore.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,559
How could this be a joke?

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,279
Every word comes from the bottom of my heart.

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,600
You sure have a lot of “bottom of your heart.”

118
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,000
You said you love makeup and powder,

119
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
and that’s from the bottom of your heart.

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
You love delicacies,

121
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,040
also from the bottom of your heart.

122
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,640
People eat all kinds of grains,

123
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,839
but in your heart,

124
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,239
how can you fit so much?

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,040
But

126
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,119
I really do have orders to return to the capital tonight.

127
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
You don’t need to come with me.

128
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,839
Stay with Lu Jiu for now.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,679
First, to continue investigating the Wuxiang treasure.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Second, to assist them

131
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,000
in going deep into Gushan

132
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,160
to eliminate the human traffickers.

133
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,200
Sir

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
Sir

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
What?

136
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,399
They didn't stay in Mist Town to look for clues.

137
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,799
Instead, they went straight to Lone Mountain.

138
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,519
Lone Mountain is just a rabble.

139
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,119
If Tianluo sends a team,

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,959
they could wipe it out in no time.

141
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,239
Lone Mountain isn't something just anyone can mess with.

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,440
Come on, you two.

143
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,760
Just be straightforward.

144
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,119
All this flirting with your eyes,

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,640
do you think others can't see it?

146
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,519
What nonsense are you talking about?

147
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,119
Who's flirting?

148
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,920
Blame me,

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
I was just born with charming eyes.

150
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,239
Charming eyes?

151
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,399
Then, Young Master Lu Jiu,

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
you must have a lot of admirers.

153
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,720
That's not true.

154
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,239
Out of all the rivers in the world,

155
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,359
I only take one ladle.

156
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,480
Among thousands of osmanthus blossoms,

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,839
I only like you.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,119
Please, you two.

159
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,440
Even if you don't care about me,

160
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,840
at least consider that person's feelings.

161
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,559
Ever since Lord Geng left,

162
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
you've been downcast.

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,039
You don't eat properly.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Now, even when you walk,

165
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
there's no strength in your steps.

166
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,559
It's really worrying.

167
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,239
Are you afraid I'll drag you all down?

168
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,840
That's not what I mean.

169
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,239
That is what you mean.

170
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,159
You all dislike me.

171
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,760
None of you want me anymore.

172
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,039
Your feelings for Lord Geng

173
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,719
are clear to all of us.

174
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,599
Lord Geng is not a cold or unfeeling person.

175
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,719
He acted this way

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,000
because he must have his own reasons.

177
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,239
What reasons could he have?

178
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,520
Lord Geng is known for his integrity.

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,960
He must have made many enemies at court.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,039
This time, as he returns,

181
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,719
he must be facing some difficult problems.

182
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,799
Leaving you here

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,359
is to

184
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,679
protect you.

185
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,559
Protect me?

186
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,440
He wants me to bring along

187
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
someone who can't fight,

188
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
someone whose skills are completely gone,

189
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,520
someone unreliable whose abilities come and go,

190
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,000
and venture deep into the dangerous Lone Mountain?

191
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,520
You call that protecting me?

192
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,840
Even though I've lost all my martial arts skills,

193
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,000
I still have my wits.

194
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,359
One person can be worth a thousand soldiers.

195
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,640
Who are you calling useless?

196
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,760
Even if my skills come and go,

197
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,359
when have I ever

198
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,239
let you down at a critical moment?

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,919
Make yourself clear.

200
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Say it clearly.

201
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,400
Spending all day with those two

202
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,760
must be hard for you.

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,119
Sorry to make Miss Bai Yu laugh.

204
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,400
We've arrived at Lone Mountain.

205
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,719
I...

206
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,239
I think I've been here before.

207
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,080
The imperial decree has arrived.

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,320
By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

209
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,159
Geng Zhao of the Investigation Bureau,

210
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,719
Diligent and hardworking,

211
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,239
often solving difficult cases,

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
greatly pleasing me.

213
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,760
I hereby bestow three hundred taels of silver,

214
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,599
and fifty bolts of silk,

215
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,960
to make clear rewards and punishments,

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,239
and to honor loyalty and virtue.

217
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,039
This is my decree.

218
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,840
Your subject Geng Zhao receives the decree.

219
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,039
Lord Geng,

220
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,359
please rise quickly.

221
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,080
I also bring the Emperor's verbal message.

222
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,320
Congratulations, Lord Geng.

223
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
If this important matter succeeds,

224
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,200
the Emperor will surely grant you marriage to Princess Bai Yu.

225
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,799
Double happiness awaits you.

226
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,559
I did not know Father had hidden Fei Ying's whereabouts for years

227
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,679
to plan for a greater purpose.

228
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,919
I nearly

229
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,640
killed Fei Ying,

230
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,280
and delayed Father's important plans.

231
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
I ask Father to punish me.

232
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,200
You are my only daughter.

233
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,679
How could I ever punish you?

234
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,799
Back then, I arranged your engagement with Fei Ying

235
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,679
indeed to use it as a means

236
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,000
Tie Fei Ying to Tianluo.

237
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
But what father in this world

238
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,000
would easily marry off his daughter to someone else?

239
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,479
Fei Ying is the one I have chosen.

240
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,520
He is also the one you have chosen.

241
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,719
Since you want him,

242
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,599
then take him back.

243
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:14,119
That is the way our Dugu family does things.

244
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,640
But how can a daughter take him back?

245
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you know how I made Tianluo

246
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,719
grow from an obscure assassination organization

247
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,000
into one that holds power over the entire court?

248
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,239
Of course, it was because of my outstanding abilities.

249
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,599
I was able to ease the emperor's worries.

250
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,280
Especially twenty years ago,

251
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,679
when I personally wiped out the traitors of Fengleitang.

252
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,960
I earned the emperor's deep trust.

253
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,520
There are countless people trusted by the emperor.

254
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,719
What sets me apart from them is

255
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,799
that I alone hold the emperor's troubles in my hands.

256
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:54,840
Fengleitang never actually rebelled.

257
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,039
But if I say they rebelled, then they did.

258
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,640
If I want their whole clan destroyed,

259
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,359
then they must be destroyed.

260
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,400
They became the stepping stone for my rise to power.

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
Father, you mean

262
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,559
planning depends on people,

263
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,080
and so does success.

264
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,159
Yes.

265
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,039
That's right.

266
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,840
Wipe out the remaining rebels of Gushan immediately.

267
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,320
The court has tolerated the Gushan group for many years.

268
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,799
Why suddenly order their extermination now?

269
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,080
Who is it?

270
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,119
Don't pretend with me.

271
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
Stop pretending.

272
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,239
Waiter, the bill.

273
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,479
Coming.

274
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,919
Brother, no, no, no.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,280
I'll pay today.

276
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
Don't move.

277
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,599
I didn't expect them to look so fierce.

278
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,599
But they're actually quite friendly.

279
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,479
Come, let's see the doctor.

280
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,080
Let's go.

281
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,159
My arm!

282
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,640
My arm!

283
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,960
Brother, we lost this round again.

284
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,039
Father, father!

285
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,799
I don't want to go with anyone else.

286
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,960
Stop!

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,080
Your son is gone.

288
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,359
How do you still have the means?

289
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
I'll bet a hand.

290
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,479
Help! Help!

291
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
Help!

292
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,479
No need to be too surprised.

293
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,760
This place is known as the City of Sin.

294
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,760
It's also where the most criminals hide out.

295
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,599
Anyone you see here

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,200
might be worth even more

297
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,719
as a wanted criminal than the two of you.

298
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,159
Then why doesn't the government come to arrest them?

299
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,039
I know the answer to that.

300
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
This place

301
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,599
is beyond the government's control.

302
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,159
Not even Lord Geng can control it?

303
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,440
It's not that no one has tried.

304
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,919
Once, an official led a large force to attack.

305
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,159
They did drive out the criminals for a while.

306
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
I guess

307
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,960
the ones who suffered

308
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,640
were the surrounding villages and towns.

309
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,280
That's right.

310
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,119
In the end, the nearby villages were looted one after another.

311
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,239
People lived in fear and misery.

312
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
Eventually, the soldiers had to withdraw.

313
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,679
Letting the criminals return to the mountain.

314
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,760
Sometimes, this has nothing to do with good or evil.

315
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,559
It's just that different forces

316
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,080
are seeking a balance.

317
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,479
Ivory is abundant in the southwest.

318
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,239
Sculptures are made from ivory.

319
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,719
It's not as rare as it is where we are.

320
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,440
So that's normal.

321
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,280
The problem is,

322
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,159
this isn't ivory, it's human bone.

323
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
When we first met,

324
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,920
you tricked me with a pig bone.

325
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,239
Who would use human bone

326
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,359
for carving?

327
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,479
Ivory has a yellowish sheen on its surface.

328
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
If it's mature ivory,

329
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,239
it will also have a brownish gloss from the oils.

330
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,680
and develop a brownish shine.

331
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:16,959
Look here.

332
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,520
This is pure white all over.

333
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,880
If you look closely,

334
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
you can see the pores unique to bone.

335
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,040
It really is.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,959
But it could also be cow or pig bone.

337
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,719
It doesn't have to be human bone.

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
Look,

339
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,359
this pattern

340
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,400
is unique to the human skull.

341
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,079
Other animals don't have it.

342
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Using a human skull to make a shell.

343
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,640
Miss, you really know your stuff.

344
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,520
This ornament is bright and shiny.

345
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,920
Only the skulls of young adults have this effect.

346
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,640
And the level of detail in this carving

347
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,640
If it's not top-quality human bone

348
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,800
and masterful craftsmanship,

349
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,319
you can't achieve this result.

350
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,439
You sly merchant!

351
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
You dare to openly sell human bones.

352
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,199
Where is your conscience?

353
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,359
So you're an outsider.

354
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,160
Go away, go away.

355
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,160
If you're not buying, then get lost.

356
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Don't interfere with my business.

357
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,640
How can you be like this?

358
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you even know who I am?

359
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I don't care who you are.

360
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,479
Here in Gushan,

361
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,000
only the laundry woman's words matter.

362
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,880
Go away, go away.

363
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,599
Put it down, put it down.

364
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,439
Hurry up and leave.

365
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Go away.

366
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,400
This is similar to your coroner's tools.

367
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,880
I left in a hurry before.

368
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,199
I left it behind in Luoyang County.

369
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,239
If you like it, let's buy it.

370
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,160
Forget about the Investigation Bureau.

371
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,959
I'm afraid I won't even have a chance to investigate cases in the future.

372
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,520
Having these is useless now.

373
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,439
This Lonely Mountain

374
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,520
Really is a place ruled by its own, with no one to control it.

375
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
Murder and robbery are everyday occurrences here.

376
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,359
It’s truly eye-opening.

377
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,119
No one knows who the Laundry Woman really is.

378
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,239
She even makes those thugs obey her.

379
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,400
Even

380
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,439
Even that person wants to meet her.

381
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,160
Who is the person you’re talking about?

382
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
Hmph, you’re just pretending not to know.

383
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,119
You got the beauty yourself and now you tease others.

384
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
So shameless.

385
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Since that’s the case,

386
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,040
I’ll let you hold our family’s beauty

387
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,079
for a while.

388
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,119
Who’s part of your family?

389
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,400
Enough.

390
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
We need to focus on the important matter.

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,199
We came to Lonely Mountain this time

392
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,400
to completely resolve the issue behind the human traffickers.

393
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,400
We must meet the Laundry Woman.

394
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,719
But the Laundry Woman

395
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,640
is rarely seen by anyone.

396
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,839
How can we get close to her?

397
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,040
This is the place.

398
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,119
There's nothing special about this restaurant.

399
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,040
Are we just here for a meal,

400
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,119
and expect to meet the leader of Gushan, the Laundry Lady?

401
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,880
Shh.

402
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,920
Are you trying to make it obvious what we're here for?

403
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,199
What's our next move?

404
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,800
We can't be here just to eat, right?

405
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,719
Sort of.

406
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,520
Then it's not a big deal.

407
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,400
With Linlang here,

408
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,119
she's worth a thousand men.

409
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,479
Sir,

410
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,520
What would you like to order?

411
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:25,880
Do you have private rooms?

412
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,719
Yes, we do.

413
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,880
Please, upstairs.

414
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,079
This way.

415
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,160
This way.

416
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,640
Sir, please this way.

417
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:43,680
Look,

418
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,959
this isn't an ordinary restaurant.

419
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,640
Sir,

420
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,959
Our specialty

421
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,079
is the large meat buns.

422
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,319
Please enjoy your meal.

423
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,160
This

424
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,079
sculpture is made from human bones.

425
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,800
Don't tell me these buns

426
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,880
are also made from human flesh?

427
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
How about

428
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
you check them?

429
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,439
They're all chopped up and steamed.

430
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,760
How am I supposed to check?

431
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,400
Don't worry.

432
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,599
We're here this time

433
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
not to eat buns.

434
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
So how can we meet that laundry woman?

435
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,280
Although the laundry woman is elusive,

436
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,800
she attends every year

437
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
the Heroes' Gathering at Gushan.

438
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,359
to show her respect for the people of the martial world.

439
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,239
Tonight,

440
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,839
the Heroes' Gathering

441
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,319
will be held right here.

442
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,760
I checked when I first came up.

443
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,680
There was hardly anyone here.

444
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,560
The Heroes' Gathering

445
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,040
Why would it be held in such an ordinary tavern?

446
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,119
Ordinary?

447
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,479
Just wait until midnight and see.

448
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,520
The air is dry.

449
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,959
Be careful with fire.

450
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,760
The air is dry.

451
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,599
Be careful with fire.

452
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,160
It's time.

453
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,760
It really is different now.

454
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,359
Well?

455
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,040
Do you still think it's ordinary?

456
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,359
It's just a bit

457
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,439
more lively than before.

458
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

459
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,319
the Heroes Gathering of the Martial World

460
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,760
is about to begin.

461
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,719
Alright.

462
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,319
Now, it officially begins.

463
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,439
What kind of heroes gathering is this?

464
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,479
Isn't it just like those human traffickers?

465
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,479
A trick to buy and sell slaves.

466
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,760
Why do you look like that?

467
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,560
Aren't you familiar with this place?

468
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,640
No wonder Lord Geng wanted to escape.

469
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,719
It really is a bit annoying.

470
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,439
You...

471
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,760
Enough, we have more important things to do.

472
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,760
Thank you.

473
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
You're such a big man, but so fussy.

474
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,599
Just like a woman.

475
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:44,319
Ladies and gentlemen,

476
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,839
the first slave

477
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,719
is a rare sight in years,

478
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
a Battle Maniac.

479
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,319
Alright.

480
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,199
One person can take on thousands.

481
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,400
Are you all looking forward to it?

482
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,599
Hurry, hurry, we can't wait!

483
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,359
Bring him up.

484
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,800
Move!

485
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,719
The Battle Maniac has a body of steel.

486
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,359
Impervious to blades and spears.

487
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
A drugged man.

488
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,719
This battle maniac

489
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,199
Although his personality is violent,

490
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,199
he can still

491
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,319
regard the first person he sees

492
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,000
the one who first gives him food

493
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,160
as his closest kin.

494
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,119
Now,

495
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,719
he has already been trained

496
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,079
and can be subdued with the sound of a bell.

497
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,560
This is no battle maniac.

498
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
He’s clearly a living person turned into a drug puppet.

499
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Back in Mist Town,

500
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,000
they used dark magic to abduct the men in town.

501
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,359
They even stripped off their clothes

502
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,439
just to sever their ties with the past.

503
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,479
To control their minds.

504
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,839
I used to think

505
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,000
death was the most terrifying thing.

506
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,640
But after seeing this,

507
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,680
I feel this is even more frightening than death.

508
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,560
If we hadn’t saved them,

509
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,959
I’m afraid right now

510
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,880
they would have already been sold like livestock.

511
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,680
Including Sima Kong.

512
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,760
So it was you.

513
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,479
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,599
I was rude just now.

515
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,400
Today,

516
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,439
I'll help you take revenge.

517
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,280
Don't act on impulse.

518
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,239
Don't forget why we came to Gushan.

519
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,280
Since there's a buyer,

520
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,439
there must be a seller.

521
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,359
Killing one or two people

522
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,520
won't solve the problem at all.

523
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,920
Saving even one person is worth it.

524
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,640
If I can save you,

525
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,160
I can save them too.

526
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I'll go with you.

527
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,439
For this kind of heroic deed,

528
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,079
how could the Diancha Division not be involved?

529
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,959
Quick, stop him!

530
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,119
Are you okay?

531
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm fine.

532
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,040
Not good, I've been caught.

533
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,400
Aren't you a Tang Clan spy?

534
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,000
Don't you know all kinds of mechanisms and traps?

535
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,839
How could you not see through such a simple trick?

536
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,880
As you can see,

537
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
this restaurant

538
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,520
is itself a huge mechanism.

539
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,479
It can change unpredictably at will.

540
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,479
Even the most skilled craftsman

541
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,719
couldn't figure out all the mechanisms in a short time.

542
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,439
Let alone

543
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,959
Is there something wrong?

544
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,760
I always feel like every move I make

545
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
is being watched by the other side.

546
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,560
It's as if that person

547
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,839
knows me very well.

548
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
It's you.

549
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,079
Who is she, really?

550
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,760
She hasn't said a word since just now.

551
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,640
Could she be mute?

552
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,959
We helped her get the household registration document

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,920
back from that stinky Taoist.

554
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,359
She shouldn't make things difficult for us.

555
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,920
You said she's the Taoist's subordinate.

556
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,839
Doesn't that mean she's the laundry woman's subordinate?

557
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,959
Is she going to hand us over for credit?

558
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,359
Logically speaking,

559
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,640
she hates that Taoist even more than I do.

560
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,439
She shouldn't still be in cahoots with them.

561
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,680
I feel

562
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,640
she's not such a cold person.

563
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,839
No need to guess anymore.

564
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,520
So she's not mute after all.

565
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,439
Back then, you told me to run away.

566
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,359
But wherever I go, it's still the jianghu.

567
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,160
Only by following the strongest can one survive in the jianghu.

568
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,760
Madam, I've brought the person.

569
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,800
So you are the Laundry Woman.

570
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,040
You're not some old crone at all.

571
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,680
It's fortunate he didn't see you.

572
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,040
I've long heard of the Laundry Woman's reputation.

573
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,040
To meet you today is truly a blessing.

574
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,560
You've committed many wrongs.

575
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:20,319
Today, we're here to uphold justice.

576
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Let's do it.

577
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,560
You're the first person after meeting me

578
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,400
who can still stand so firm.

579
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,439
But

580
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,160
Underestimating your opponent is a grave mistake in our world.

581
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,239
What,

582
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,439
young man,

583
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,680
are you giving up already?

584
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,479
I, Lu Jiu,

585
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,839
have never admitted defeat.

586
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Lu Jiu.

587
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,640
Lu Jiu of the Lu family in Luoyang County.

588
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,640
I never change my name or hide my identity.

589
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,959
What are you doing?

590
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,160
My son!

591
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,040
Mother has finally found you.

592
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,839
Lu Jiu has never liked interacting with people.

593
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,160
I still remember the first time I met him.

594
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,599
I almost fell down.

595
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,079
He didn't even help me up.

596
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,520
It made me embarrass myself in front of everyone.

597
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,640
According to what you said,

598
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,119
the actions of that Taoist

599
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,560
were all done behind Gushan's back.

600
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,520
That's right.

601
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,640
Madam has always managed things well.

602
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,959
Although Gushan shelters people from the underworld,

603
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,680
each one of them is a person of justice.

604
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,959
She would never allow her subordinates

605
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,319
to get involved in human trafficking.

606
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,719
Then what about the Heroes' Gathering just now?

607
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,079
How do you explain that?

608
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,359
Those who were bought and sold

609
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,199
are all people guilty of heinous crimes.

610
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,000
After I subdued them,

611
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,560
I didn't want to take their lives.

612
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,719
This Heroes' Society

613
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,079
is meant to give them a chance to reform.

614
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,920
After they are sold to buyers,

615
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,560
all uses will be supervised by us

616
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,040
to ensure they won't harm the martial world again.

617
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,719
Creating drugged people is what you call "battle maniacs."

618
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,239
For the safety of the martial world,

619
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,880
that person brought it upon himself.

620
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,079
He colluded with that old Taoist.

621
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,839
They stole the secret recipe for making drugged people.

622
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,079
They secretly turned living people into drugged people and sold them.

623
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,839
The old woman was just using their own methods

624
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,439
to deal with them.

625
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,160
I am from the Hall of Wind and Thunder.

626
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
The hall master, Luo Feng, is highly skilled in medicine.

627
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,400
After discovering the method for making drugged people,

628
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,199
fearing it would harm the martial world,

629
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,880
he sealed the method away.

630
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,160
I respect the hall master

631
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,040
and would never disobey his orders.

632
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,880
No wonder those criminals used

633
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,760
Blood Scorpion, Tianxiong, Amethyst,

634
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,400
Qianhu, Bajiji, Southern Star

635
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,959
as secret codes for entering and exiting.

636
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,640
They're all names of medicinal herbs.

637
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,520
And that old Taoist

638
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,079
is truly despicable.

639
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,359
Just like Li Mu,

640
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,599
he actually used medicine to harm people.

641
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,959
We caused a commotion at the Heroes' Society earlier.

642
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,599
That was our mistake.

643
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,359
There is still one thing I don't understand.

644
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,239
Why are you able to take charge of Gushan,

645
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,439
but abandoned Lu Jiu back then?

646
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,359
It's not that I didn't want to look for him.

647
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,599
But that treacherous Li Chu

648
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,119
hid Jiu'er away.

649
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,000
I searched everywhere, north and south of the great river,

650
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,640
but found no news of him.

651
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,640
Li Chu.

652
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,239
I know about this.

653
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,280
Li Chu was the second-in-command of Fenglei Hall back then.

654
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:09,040
Fenglei Hall rebelled that year.

655
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,599
Dugu was ordered to suppress the rebellion.

656
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,439
He was the one who coordinated from inside and out.

657
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
But afterwards,

658
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,479
he disappeared without a trace.

659
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,680
Fenglei Hall never rebelled.

660
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,040
It was Li Chu and Dugu Wuwo who colluded.

661
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,680
They falsely claimed that Master Luo possessed the Wuxiang treasure.

662
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,400
and would threaten the court and the nation.

663
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:25,920
In fact,

664
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,079
they were the ones who wanted to seize the treasure.
