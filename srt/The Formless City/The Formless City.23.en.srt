1
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,199
I no longer have this daughter.

2
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,360
At your command.

3
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
Kill without mercy.

4
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,720
Go!

5
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,440
Senior Sister.

6
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,559
Senior Sister, go.

7
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,320
Senior Sister.

8
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
Senior Sister.

9
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Return.

10
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Yes.

11
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,440
It's Luming City.

12
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,839
He.

13
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,559
He took the hairpin.

14
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,919
He also snatched it away.

15
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,839
Sir.

16
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,079
I, Dugu Wumo,

17
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,000
have schemed for half my life,

18
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,839
even sacrificed my own daughter.

19
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,279
I never expected

20
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,320
to be defeated by a dog.

21
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,239
This river

22
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
flows toward the capital.

23
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,760
I hope Miss Yemei's spirit in heaven

24
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,119
can receive your feelings.

25
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
For her,

26
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,239
and for those killed by Tianluo,

27
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,519
I must find the Wuxiang treasure.

28
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,880
and completely defeat Tianluo.

29
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,200
Count me in.

30
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,519
Me too.

31
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,559
And me.

32
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,559
However,

33
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,279
to return to the past,

34
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
there are still a few obstacles

35
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,959
that must be overcome.

36
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,839
I will never allow it.

37
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,399
Anyone who has hurt Linlang to enter this house.

38
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Uncle.

39
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,320
Lu Jiu had completely lost his memory at that time.

40
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
He couldn't control himself.

41
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,839
It's not the first time he's lost his memory.

42
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,200
If in the future

43
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,679
he forgets again, what should we do?

44
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,160
It's not impossible.

45
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,600
I...

46
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,399
I did hurt Linlang before.

47
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,600
But I swear

48
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
I will never forget her again.

49
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,200
Even if he forgets me again,

50
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,640
I will make him remember me every time.

51
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
My brother who passed away early

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
how did he raise a daughter like you,

53
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,200
who always sides with outsiders?

54
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,799
Even if

55
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,760
he has already regained Lu Jiu's memories,

56
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,040
in the past,

57
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,160
he was still a killer sent by Tianluo.

58
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Is this also the reason

59
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
why mother doesn't want to see me?

60
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,239
You were sent to Tianluo as a hostage when you were a child.

61
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,160
Chief Xu has never stopped searching for you.

62
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Now,

63
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,600
she is doing her utmost to rebuild Fenglei Hall.

64
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,959
Your identity is so unique.

65
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,399
She is also caught in a difficult situation.

66
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,040
I understand.

67
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,559
This time, I have returned

68
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,519
to help Fenglei Hall.

69
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,359
To destroy Tianluo

70
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
and restore peace to the world.

71
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,119
That sounds nice.

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,640
But who can prove

73
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,640
that you are not a spy sent by Tianluo?

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,959
I don't want

75
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,640
you to hurt Linlang in the future,

76
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,760
or let Master Luo's legacy be destroyed.

77
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,640
Back then, Master Luo founded Fenglei Hall

78
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,679
to help and save people.

79
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,920
He wanted people in the martial world to have something to rely on.

80
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,119
But now you

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,119
claim to be reviving Fenglei Hall,

82
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,839
yet you are so cold-hearted.

83
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,399
The matters of Fenglei Hall

84
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
are not for Tangmen to comment on.

85
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,880
I...

86
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,399
Old Yan speaks rashly.

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,320
If there was any offense, please forgive us.

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
His words may be blunt, but his reasoning is sound.

89
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,440
Lu Jiu is inherently loyal.

90
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,600
He is loyal and righteous.

91
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
When he discovered his own identity

92
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,920
was connected to Tianluo,

93
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,679
he chose to distance himself from Linlang.

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
To protect her.

95
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,239
I saw all of this.

96
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,440
Yes, Uncle.

97
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,279
When Lu Jiu was still Fei Ying,

98
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,959
he was ordered to take me back to Tianluo.

99
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,079
But along the way,

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,320
he never did anything to harm me.

101
00:07:58,799 --> 00:07:59,640
I believe

102
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,679
his true nature has always been Lu Jiu.

103
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,399
I can vouch for this.

104
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,559
If Lu Jiu had ill intentions,

105
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,839
how could I have gone against the orders of the Diancha Division

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
and stood by his side?

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
I can also testify.

108
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,519
I know myself,

109
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,239
it is hardest to prove one's own heart.

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
If you, elder,

111
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,600
are worried about my Tianluo identity

112
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,679
and do not trust me,

113
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,839
then I will erase everything related to Tianluo

114
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,200
completely.

115
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,359
Are you crazy?

116
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,000
If you want to atone,

117
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,559
you can redeem yourself through meritorious deeds.

118
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,119
Use the martial arts you learned in Tianluo

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,119
to capture all the people of Tianluo.

120
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,799
Hmm.

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,039
That's right.

122
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,039
Clear the name of Fenglei Hall.

123
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,039
Defeat Tianluo.

124
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,359
Only then are you worthy to be my son, Xu Xiang.

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,559
Mother.

126
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,159
How dare you trick me.

127
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,960
The hairpin you handed over

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,159
was actually a fake.

129
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,520
So, how was it?

130
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,119
My acting was pretty good, wasn't it?

131
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,159
This trick

132
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
was prepared even before we crashed your wedding with Ye Mei.

133
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,960
It was all set up in advance.

134
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,799
What exactly is going on here?

135
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,200
Linlang

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
had already anticipated that in the manor

137
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,960
there would be Tianluo, Tang Clan,

138
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,640
and even spies working for Li Chu.

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,640
So,

140
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
she spread the news,

141
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,080
and then I

142
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,320
made an identical copy of the hairpin

143
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,960
to confuse their attention.

144
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,679
So,

145
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,159
Linlang being captured

146
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,080
was planned by the two of you?

147
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,119
Of course.

148
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,239
Even though my young master has lost his martial arts,

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
just with the traps he set up,

150
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,760
he could keep Miss Linlang completely safe.

151
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,799
She wouldn't be caught so easily.

152
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,359
Well done, you two.

153
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:22,799
You actually fooled everyone.

154
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,440
Not only did you trick that old fox Dugu,

155
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,039
but even everyone in Fenglei Hall

156
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,159
was deceived.

157
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
It must have been hard on Uncle and Chief Xu.

158
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,200
You made them worry about me.

159
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,840
I just wanted to prevent any leaks.

160
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,719
I understand.

161
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
For the grand plan of Fenglei Hall,

162
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,719
these things are nothing.

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,119
However,

164
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,679
the clue to the Wuxiang treasure left by Master Luo

165
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,520
is it really inside this hairpin?

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,359
No, it isn't.

167
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,159
I understand.

168
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,440
Although the clue to the treasure

169
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,760
is not in this hairpin,

170
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,479
however,

171
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,359
this is the only thing Madam Luo

172
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,880
left for you.

173
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,200
You’re not willing

174
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,799
to trade it away.

175
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,520
You really do understand me best.

176
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:20,960
Sweet talk.

177
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,440
Can we save that for later?

178
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,960
Can we focus on business now?

179
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,440
When I was replicating the hairpin,

180
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,440
I discovered

181
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,640
the real clue

182
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,880
is not in the hairpin

183
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,320
but in the jewelry box that holds the hairpin.

184
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,719
I used to think

185
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,840
that at Dugu's place

186
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,679
there were three map fragments

187
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,159
and at Linlang's place

188
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,559
was the last fragment

189
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
We thought the same before

190
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,760
But now it seems

191
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,919
this so-called map

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
is just a distraction

193
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,760
So you're saying

194
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,400
the location of the Wuxiang treasure is hidden in this

195
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,280
jewelry box

196
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,840
But it's all in Sanskrit, could it be

197
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,440
that we need to form

198
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,880
a password

199
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,239
That's right

200
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,400
But the Sanskrit is complicated

201
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,799
I haven't found the answer yet

202
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:23,919
Lu Jiu

203
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,679
I remember when you took me back to Tianluo

204
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,280
Lu Kun and Dugu said

205
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,000
before you disappeared as Fei Ying

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,640
you had found a crucial clue

207
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,559
but you haven't recovered that memory yet

208
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,159
Do you remember it now?

209
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,119
No, I don't

210
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,200
I only remember

211
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,960
most of Fei Ying's memories

212
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,039
but this part

213
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,599
is completely blank for me

214
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,719
Seven years ago

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,960
You lost your memory in Mist Town

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,080
Dugu and Li Chu

217
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,719
led you all the way to Mist Town

218
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,239
Clues

219
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,719
Could they be in Mist Town?

220
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,200
No, they're not

221
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,799
I remember at that time

222
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,960
I found clues about my mother

223
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,479
so I came here specifically

224
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,880
Mist Town was just

225
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,679
a necessary stop on the way to Lone Mountain

226
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,799
You've been to Lone Mountain

227
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,440
Yes

228
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,000
Back then

229
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,840
I was obsessed

230
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,520
hoping to use clues about the Wuxiang treasure

231
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,359
to restore the bond between father and son

232
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,479
So I invited Li Chu to Lone Mountain

233
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,760
But unexpectedly

234
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,840
he actually, for the clues

235
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,960
pushed me off Longchi Cliff

236
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,359
So Li Chu

237
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,320
has been pretending to live in seclusion in Water City

238
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,719
but has actually been investigating clues in Mist Town

239
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,719
Little did he know

240
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,479
the clues aren't in Mist Town

241
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,760
Then where could the clues be?

242
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,559
The bamboo house

243
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,280
Do you remember at the Iron Wall Vault

244
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,320
the bamboo house from the deed?

245
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,039
My memory from seven years ago

246
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,239
is that I once stayed there

247
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,440
Inside

248
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,000
there are many Sanskrit scriptures

249
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,039
Maybe

250
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,479
these are the clues

251
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,280
Alright

252
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,200
Then let's set out today

253
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:18,960
Okay

254
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,599
Slow down.

255
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,760
What are you doing?

256
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,000
We're leaving tomorrow.

257
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,799
I still have so many things I haven't prepared.

258
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,080
I owe you a trip to the Lantern Festival.

259
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,799
I said before,

260
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,880
I promised you,

261
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,320
and I will definitely keep my word.

262
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,039
This golden hairpin is crafted so delicately.

263
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,200
Could it be

264
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,359
from the palace?

265
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,520
That's perfect then.

266
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,679
My son is about to get married.

267
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,359
Pick the best one for me.

268
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,159
I want to give it to my future

269
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,599
daughter-in-law.

270
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,640
That's just right.

271
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:07,960
Come, come.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,840
Today,

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,520
we're talking about the most famous detective in the Diancha Department,

274
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,320
Geng Zhao.

275
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,520
This person

276
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,159
can handle official matters,

277
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,359
and also deal with the underworld.

278
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
He excels in both areas.

279
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,599
Wait, that's not right.

280
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,159
That was in the past.

281
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,359
Nowadays,

282
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,039
the most impressive one is

283
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,760
the female detective Xu Linlang.

284
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,719
Sir, buy a sky lantern.

285
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,239
It can bless couples with unity.

286
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
And never be separated for eternity.

287
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,239
Who has the mood to buy sky lanterns right now?

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,880
I found something in the teahouse backyard.

289
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,919
I discovered an unidentified woman's body.

290
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,919
Look.

291
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,559
These are her remains.

292
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,760
Isn't investigating cases your specialty?

293
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,479
Can't you sound a bit more natural?

294
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,080
It's true that I know how to investigate cases.

295
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,520
But I don't know how to act like I'm investigating.

296
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,880
You arranged all of this.

297
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,840
Although time can't be turned back,

298
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,039
still,

299
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,080
I still want to do my best to make up for it.

300
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,359
Our past,

301
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,400
the present,

302
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,719
and the future,

303
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
I will keep them all in my heart.

304
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,440
This time,

305
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,559
I won't let go again.

306
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,040
Young Master

307
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,160
Look how lively it is.

308
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,319
Why are you going back so early?

309
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,079
I'm no longer the Young Master.

310
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm just used to it.

311
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,680
You're really carefree.

312
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,400
This time, we're pretending to surrender.

313
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,560
But we're using the Tang Clan's name.

314
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,520
To cause a commotion at Tianluo.

315
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,920
Master definitely won't let us off.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
It's fine.

317
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,599
Actually,

318
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,160
about this matter,

319
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,400
I'll take full responsibility.

320
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,359
Tomorrow, Linlang, Lu Jiu, and I

321
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,640
will set out to search for clues to the Wuxiang treasure.

322
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,760
You just stay at Gushan and don't worry.

323
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,560
With the protection of Fenglei Hall,

324
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,439
you'll be safe.

325
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,199
No, what I mean is—

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,920
What you want to say,

327
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,280
I understand it all.

328
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,119
So, is it

329
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,599
that you understand,

330
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,079
or not?

331
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,479
You must be careful on your journey.

332
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,119
Mother, don't worry.

333
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,359
Even if we can't find any clues to the treasure,

334
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,839
we'll definitely come back.

335
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,199
We

336
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,640
will be waiting for you here.

337
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,880
Young Master,

338
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,160
are you sure you don't need me to go with you?

339
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
At least I'd be there to help.

340
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,199
Geng Zhao is willing to go with you all.

341
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,920
Bai Yu gave up her title as princess for you

342
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,640
and even took on the crime of escaping prison.

343
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,760
You should stay here

344
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
and take good care of her.

345
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:57,880
Don't worry.

346
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,199
Even though I don't have martial arts skills,

347
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,520
I have these treasures

348
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,479
which are enough to bring the two of them back safely.

349
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,760
Although the road ahead is dangerous,

350
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,560
fortunately,

351
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,880
it's a path the three of us have traveled before.

352
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,000
Previously, we did the same

353
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,640
when we came from Luoyang County to Gushan.

354
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,959
And didn't we all make it just fine?

355
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,599
Just stay here and wait for our good news.

356
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,359
Leave everything outside to us.

357
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,640
We'll leave Gushan and Fenglei Hall to you.

358
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,479
We will not fail our mission.

359
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,839
We will not fail our mission.

360
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,359
Take care.

361
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:30,640
Hyah!

362
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,560
Hyah!

363
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,040
Hyah!

364
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,199
Hyah!

365
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,079
Hyah!

366
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:40,839
Hyah!

367
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,040
Hyah!

368
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,760
Last time at this place

369
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,239
I almost forgot about you

370
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,680
and left you in danger

371
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,400
Are you afraid that going in will turn you into Fei Ying again?

372
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,959
I'm not afraid

373
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,680
No matter what I become

374
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,479
you will always

375
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,920
bring me back the same way

376
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,719
Right?

377
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,479
Yeah

378
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,439
Let's go

379
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
It's this

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,040
A row of six boxes

381
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,400
The Sanskrit name

382
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,680
should also be six characters

383
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
But there are too many combinations of six characters

384
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,359
Guanyin Wheel

385
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,199
The clue is right here

386
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,079
The Sanskrit name for Guanyin is

387
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,439
Avalokiteśvara

388
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Five characters

389
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,160
Even if Tibetan was created based on Sanskrit

390
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,359
The Tibetan name for Guanyin is Jianrexi

391
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,680
Three characters

392
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,400
That's not right either

393
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,359
Ji Gong

394
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
His mantra is

395
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,400
Om Mani Padme Hum

396
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,760
That's right

397
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,520
Six characters

398
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,400
Great Bright Mantra

399
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,640
These

400
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,719
I saw these when I was burning incense at the coffin shop.

401
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,280
Guanyin

402
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:40,920
Puxian

403
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,719
Wenshu, Dizang

404
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,640
And also Maitreya

405
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,800
They should be similar to the map fragments that Dugu has.

406
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,920
We need to find the locations of the five small statues.

407
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,800
The map

408
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
should be hidden inside the small statues.

409
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,079
If we piece together the five maps,

410
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,839
we can find the entrance to the treasure.

411
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Look here.

412
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,239
The ruins of Yin Ghost serve as the foundation.

413
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,359
The holy protector's name shelters the coiled dragon.

414
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,160
The five great followers pay homage.

415
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,959
They come to see Shizhi seated in the mandala.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,160
This is a Buddhist verse.

417
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,520
The ruins of Yin Ghost

418
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,959
must be Wuxiang City.

419
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,800
Legend says it was an ancient city built during the Yin dynasty.

420
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,880
As for the holy protector's name,

421
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,280
Pan Chi is a dragon.

422
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,839
So the ancient city is related to dragons.

423
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,839
But where is this city related to dragons

424
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,079
located?

425
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,359
What happened?

426
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Old Yan sent word.

427
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,199
Someone massacred Gushan.

428
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,119
Hyah!

429
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,959
Hyah!

430
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,439
Hyah!

431
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,680
Hyah!

432
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Hyah!

433
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Hyah!

434
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,479
Hyah!

435
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,280
Mother

436
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,959
There's not a single person here.

437
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,199
There’s no one on my side either.

438
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,160
Could they all have been taken away?

439
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,760
The ones who did this

440
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,119
are only Tianluo,

441
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:21,880
Tangmen,

442
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and Luming City.

443
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,560
No.

444
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,439
My master may be cold-hearted,

445
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,959
but he would never do something like this.

446
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Tianluo,

447
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,800
Luming City,

448
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
have both massacred Fenglei Hall before.

449
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,040
But

450
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,719
they wouldn’t go to such lengths

451
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
to take everyone away.

452
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,239
That makes sense.

453
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,359
They must be hiding them.

454
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,000
Linlang,

455
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,560
you’re the best at handling this.

456
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,000
There were about fifty intruders.

457
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,160
They entered in two groups.

458
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,479
One group broke in through the main entrance.

459
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,560
The other group climbed over the wall.

460
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,560
All of them were about eight feet tall.

461
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,119
They were well-trained martial artists.

462
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,800
Judging by the traces of the fight,

463
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,119
they were different from the Tianluo assassins.

464
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,439
They probably weren't from Tianluo.

465
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,439
There aren't many hidden weapons scattered here.

466
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,680
They were likely left behind when Old Yan resisted.

467
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,560
That only leaves Luming City.

468
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,719
But

469
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,359
I've fought his subordinates before.

470
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,119
They're all rather mediocre.

471
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,760
They shouldn't have been able to

472
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,520
overwhelm everyone at Gushan so completely.

473
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,400
Judging by the signs of counterattack,

474
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,800
our people were probably caught off guard.

475
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,760
They were completely unprepared.

476
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,839
That's why they were at a disadvantage from the start.

477
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,800
And kept falling back.

478
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
Strange.

479
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,239
What's wrong?

480
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,959
The traces of fighting disappear here.

481
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,760
Judging by the assassins' footprints,

482
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,400
they also searched around.

483
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,560
It's as if

484
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,959
the people being chased suddenly vanished.

485
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,280
What exactly did we miss?

486
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,239
I know.

487
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,959
Looking at the traces of the fight we just found,

488
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,119
there were knives, spears, swords, and halberds.

489
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,479
But no whips.

490
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,599
Xing'er.

491
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,079
Do you all remember

492
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,719
when we first arrived at Gushan,

493
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
the secret passage we used?

494
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,599
Let's go.

495
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,839
So it was you.

496
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,119
Master Geng.

497
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,839
Mother.

498
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,959
Jiu'er, are you alright?

499
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,640
How did you find this place?

500
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,839
Linlang is at the Xu family.

501
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,439
There were no signs of your fighting.

502
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,800
You have always valued loyalty and friendship.

503
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,239
You would never escape alone.

504
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,239
Plus, you know Gushan better than anyone.

505
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:15,000
So you would definitely find a way to save everyone.

506
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,319
Xinger did not fail her mission.

507
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,680
She held Fenglei Hall.

508
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:19,680
Xinger.

509
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,239
This time, it was all thanks to you.

510
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,160
Actually, it wasn't just my achievement.

511
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,400
Lumingcheng led a midnight raid.

512
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,560
It was Old Yan who noticed it first.

513
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,359
He used Tang Clan techniques to hold them off for a while.

514
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,439
Then Lord Geng led people to split up and act.

515
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,400
They lured the enemy away.

516
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,400
That gave me the chance to save everyone.

517
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,079
That Lumingcheng is truly ruthless.

518
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,000
He and Li Chu

519
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,800
have been hiding under Dugu's command for years.

520
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,079
They gathered a lot of evidence of Dugu's treason.

521
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,359
They secretly spread it.

522
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,199
It was enough to make the court wary.

523
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,280
Dugu is now imprisoned.

524
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,439
He took this opportunity

525
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,239
to seize the puzzle piece from Dugu.

526
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,640
But what he didn't know

527
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,599
was that you had already arrived at the bamboo house.

528
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,959
This massacre at Gushan

529
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,079
was to seize the final puzzle piece.

530
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,680
But while you were hiding here,

531
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,800
didn't Lumingcheng continue to hunt you?

532
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
Fortunately, there was a master

533
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,520
who turned this place into a fortress.

534
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,680
We used all kinds of weapons to fight back.

535
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,599
They attacked for days but couldn't break through.

536
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,640
We were afraid they might fake a retreat.

537
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,160
So we never left.

538
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,680
To think there is such a master here.

539
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,839
I would like to learn from him.

540
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,160
Master

541
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,119
Master

542
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:38,640
Please have some tea.

543
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,800
Hmph.

544
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,640
You have betrayed the Tang Sect time and again.

545
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,880
And you even abandoned your Tang Sect martial arts.

546
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,800
I can't accept being called your master.

547
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,800
Last time, I caused trouble in Tianluo in the name of the Tang Sect.

548
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,199
It was my fault.

549
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,160
I accept any punishment you see fit.

550
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,520
If you hadn't done this,

551
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,359
I would have also

552
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,599
drawn a clear line with Tianluo.

553
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,760
The Tang Sect is renowned for its skills.

554
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,079
We seek the Wuxiang treasure

555
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,319
only to pass down our thousand-year-old techniques

556
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,680
to future generations.

557
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,680
But Dugu Wume only cares about his own ambitions.

558
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
He wants our unique skills to disappear completely.

559
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,280
I absolutely cannot tolerate that.

560
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,680
So, Master,

561
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,959
when you asked me to steal Linlang's mother's keepsake,

562
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,599
you knew you young people couldn't solve the riddle.

563
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,560
It would be faster if I did it myself.

564
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,680
So I misunderstood you, Master.

565
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,880
If you ask me,

566
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,079
the young sect leader not only mastered Tang Sect skills,

567
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
but even his temperament

568
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,680
is exactly like the sect leader's.

569
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,920
He keeps everything bottled up inside.

570
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,800
If the young sect leader had known earlier

571
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,839
how much you secretly did for him,

572
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,680
would he still misunderstand you like this?

573
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,880
Don't talk nonsense.

574
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,760
When did I ever do so much for him?

575
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,880
You did plenty.

576
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,959
Aren't you just stopping me from saying it?

577
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,479
Young Master

578
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,079
Kong'er

579
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,640
Old Yan

580
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,000
I told you to act as medicine men

581
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,199
I didn't tell you to go overboard

582
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,800
What if you scare the child?

583
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:09,760
No

584
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,239
Kong'er

585
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,280
Young Master

586
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,719
Did you see that?

587
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,199
All these years

588
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,479
How wronged I've been

589
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:22,920
Master

590
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,319
Is all this true?

591
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,880
Don't listen to his nonsense

592
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,719
Master, are you alright?

593
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,479
Master is just getting old

594
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,560
He only worked for a few days

595
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,280
His body can't take it anymore

596
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,359
The future of Tang Sect

597
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,959
still depends on you young people

598
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,839
I understand, Master

599
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,199
Young Lord

600
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
Luo Linlang and the others have returned

601
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,920
Should we continue the attack?

602
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,760
Since they've come back

603
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,520
it means they still haven't figured out

604
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,239
the key to the Wuxiang Treasure

605
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,680
Let's wait until they get close to the treasure

606
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,400
It's not too late to act then

607
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,479
Yes

608
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,599
That old man

609
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,599
has failed here twice

610
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,199
I will never let the Wuxiang Treasure

611
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,800
slip through my fingers again
