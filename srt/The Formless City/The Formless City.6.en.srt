1
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,199
You two,

2
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,839
Are you here to eat or to stay?

3
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,800
One superior room.

4
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,919
One room facing the street.

5
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
The cheapest room.

6
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Sir,

7
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Rooms facing the street are noisy.

8
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm particular about beds.

9
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,679
I won't be able to sleep.

10
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,720
You take the superior room.

11
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,759
Me, in the superior room?

12
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,600
Do I need to repeat myself?

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,759
No need, no need.

14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,119
But...

15
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,119
If I take the superior room and you take the street-facing one,

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
that's not appropriate.

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
You're delicate and precious.

18
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,360
I don't want it to be the other way around,

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
having to take care of someone with a sore back and legs.

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
How do you know

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
I'd get a sore back and legs from a cheap bed?

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,639
I... I've never told you before.

23
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,639
I didn't expect

24
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,960
you cared so much about me.

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,919
It's fine.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,119
If you don't want to, I'll take it back.

27
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,279
Don't! Please, you two, stop arguing.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,639
Our inn only has one side room facing the street left.

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,720
It's fine, it's fine.

30
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,360
We can make do.

31
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,800
Sir,

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're here on official business, so priorities come first.

33
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,639
A room facing the street

34
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,240
makes it easier to observe the surroundings.

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,520
Please just make do.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Old man,

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,160
young wife,

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,440
you're quite lucky in love.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,240
We're not— Thank you, boss.

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,039
Go tell them.

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,279
Where we're staying.

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,919
Why is it me again?

43
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,399
This is a temporary assistant.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,559
Things that need to be done.

45
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,880
And also,

46
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,600
Bring all our luggage over.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,919
Me?

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,119
Hurry, go!

49
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Faster!

50
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,839
Don't come over here!

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,440
Give my mother back to me!

52
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,679
Give her back!

53
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,720
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
He's a madman.

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
Village chief.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,039
Why keep such a menace around?

57
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,839
Just kill him to avenge the village women.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

59
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,960
It's true that a murderer should pay with his life.

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,200
But everything should be handled by the authorities according to the law.

61
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,799
In a few days,

62
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,600
it will be the day when the miasma forest disappears for a month.

63
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,279
I suggest

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,399
we detain him for now.

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,559
What if he escapes in the meantime?

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,079
He should be torn to pieces.

67
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,399
Everyone, calm down.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
If we take justice into our own hands,

69
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,279
how are we any different from the murderer?

70
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,959
You're an outsider woman meddling in our village's affairs.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,920
We want revenge!

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
Revenge—yes, we want revenge!

73
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,640
Everyone, calm down!

74
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,320
Linlang, are you okay?

75
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm fine.

76
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,200
Doctor Li,

77
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,079
You are highly respected.

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Why don't you say something?

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
I can't see.

80
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,519
They can't hear.

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,760
Whether I speak or not,

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,239
what difference does it make?

83
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,799
Doctor Li,

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,959
Linlang,

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,399
Don't be impulsive.

86
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,160
They're monsters and beasts now.

87
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,279
If you go, you won't be able to save him,

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
and you'll only hurt yourself.

89
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,079
That's right.

90
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,279
He's not wrong.

91
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,079
But I can't just stand by and watch

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,239
Ergou get killed.

93
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,760
Linlang,

94
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,359
Beat him to death!

95
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,239
Hit him!

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Hit!

97
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,880
Hit! Hit!

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Avenge him!

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,959
Beat him to death!

100
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,040
Why is it raining?

101
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,320
It's raining.

102
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,519
Beat him to death!

103
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,239
Drink the ginger soup.

104
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,760
Warm yourself up.

105
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
This case is about to be closed.

106
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,399
The miasma in the Miasma Forest

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
dissipates once a month.

108
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,799
We need to get ready to set out.

109
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,760
But Sima Kong's injury—

110
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,000
Sima Kong's injury

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,079
is just a cover.

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,959
You want to stay.

113
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,839
How did you know?

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
You usually don't hide it.

115
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,640
When something's on your mind,

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,839
it's easy to tell.

117
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
You want to stay

118
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,079
and keep investigating the case.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,799
Lu Jiu,

120
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,320
I know that going to Mist Town to find out your brother's whereabouts

121
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,119
is the most important thing for us right now.

122
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,959
If we miss this chance,

123
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,399
we'll have to wait over a month before we can leave here again.

124
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,119
Actually,

125
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,799
my trip to Mist Town

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,519
isn't just for my brother.

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,399
Why did you bring me here?

128
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,519
When the body was first discovered,

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,119
I came here with the villagers.

130
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,119
The body was here.

131
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,839
On that wall over there,

132
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,480
are the scratch marks left by Ergou.

133
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,320
It was me.

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,519
Those scratch marks

135
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,760
were left by me.

136
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,200
Young Master, everything is fine.

137
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,440
You went through so much trouble

138
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,920
to get here through the miasma forest

139
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,239
just to greet me?

140
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,040
No.

141
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,239
I discovered

142
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,399
that Inspector Geng Zhao

143
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,279
is lying in wait outside the miasma forest.

144
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,679
His goal

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,119
is probably the same as Lian Buci's.

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,679
He just wants to capture Lu Jiu and take him back.

147
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,760
He is nothing to fear.

148
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,679
The information you asked me to investigate

149
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,839
I have already found out.

150
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,040
Tiger Claw Fist

151
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,160
is a unique martial art of Tianluo.

152
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,399
In the past ten years,

153
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,079
the Tianluo leader, Dugu,

154
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,440
has only taught it to one person.

155
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,799
That is his adopted son,

156
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,720
Fei Ying.

157
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,160
Fei Ying.

158
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,160
The top assassin of Wuxiang City who disappeared years ago.

159
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,359
Before he disappeared,

160
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,519
Dugu sent him

161
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,760
to work as a secret tomb raider.

162
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:55,959
That year,

163
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,640
he was only thirteen.

164
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,559
Thirteen years ago,

165
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,119
I fell seriously ill.

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,720
When I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.

167
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
Are you blind or something?

168
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,359
These tiger claws

169
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,760
are indeed the same as your previous fighting style.

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,839
But judging from the marks,

171
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,519
it should be a weapon like a blade.

172
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,679
I've never seen a blade shaped like tiger claws.

173
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,559
Ever since I entered this village,

174
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,359
I've had a strange sense of familiarity.

175
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,920
I remember you said before

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
that you had a serious illness as a child,

177
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,520
and lost all your memories afterward.

178
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
Could it be...

179
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,559
I'm not sure.

180
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,919
But

181
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,919
everything

182
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159
should be related to Mist Village.

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
How did you find out?

184
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,200
Come with me.

185
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,000
Earlier

186
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,239
I was in my elder brother's study's secret room

187
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,719
and found a map pointing to Mist Town

188
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,640
So Sima Kong and I

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,359
decided to travel together

190
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,239
And recently, in my memory

191
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
this map

192
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,559
appeared right here

193
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,200
Fei Ying was still young at the time

194
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,039
small in stature but exceptionally skilled in martial arts

195
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,599
a promising candidate for tomb raiding

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
But Tian Luo's goal

197
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,719
is probably not just tomb raiding

198
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,159
or simply earning a few coins

199
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,960
So, Young Master means

200
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,919
the burial items in this ancient tomb

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,559
are related to the Wuxiang treasure

202
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,520
Send a message by carrier pigeon immediately

203
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,440
and report to the sect leader

204
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,400
Yes

205
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,719
It's just that

206
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,719
Just what?

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
If the sect leader asks

208
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,039
how you knew

209
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,599
about Tiger Claw Fist

210
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,000
Among the assassins who tried to kill Lu Jiu,

211
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,719
someone once used Tiger Claw Fist.

212
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,320
Hmm.

213
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
That makes sense.

214
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,599
But...

215
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,559
What's wrong now?

216
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,039
Young Master,

217
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,039
have you recently

218
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,760
experienced a sudden rapid heartbeat

219
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,719
or a flushed face?

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,159
I think I have.

221
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,119
Why do you ask?

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,520
This place is beautiful and secluded,

223
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,200
between men and women,

224
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,119
it's easy for feelings to develop.

225
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,280
My heart belongs only to Tang Sect.

226
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,719
I've never been tempted by romance.

227
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,479
No, no, no.

228
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,440
What I mean is,

229
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Lu Jiu

230
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,159
Lu Jiu and Lin Lang are close.

231
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
If they develop feelings for each other

232
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,479
and join forces,

233
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:30,119
wouldn't it be harder for you to gather information?

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,919
I understand.

235
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,960
You may go.

236
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,719
Alright.

237
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Why are you back so late?

238
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,599
How did it go?

239
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,080
Everything is normal.

240
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,719
Why are you still awake?

241
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,880
These past few days, I noticed the top shelf of the medicine cabinet

242
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,039
has many rarely used medicines

243
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,039
that have already gone bad.

244
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,119
So I reorganized them and moved them to the lower shelf

245
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
to make it easier for Doctor Li to access.

246
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,719
Miss Xu,

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,919
thank you so much.

248
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,919
A few years ago, I could still see.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,320
So I made the medicine cabinet a bit taller.

250
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Later, I lost my sight.

251
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,919
It became inconvenient to move the cabinet, so I left it as it was.

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,640
So you could see before?

253
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes.

254
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,119
My wife and I

255
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,919
were childhood sweethearts.

256
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,719
We studied medicine and made medicines together.

257
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,719
Sadly, she passed away suddenly.

258
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,320
I cried every day.

259
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,719
And my eyes...

260
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,400
Speaking of which,

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
this cabinet

262
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,599
was made when my wife and I got married.

263
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
Back then,

264
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,679
my wife would help me organize these herbs every day, just like Miss Xu does now.

265
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,679
She helped me sort these medicinal herbs.

266
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:48,919
In the blink of an eye,

267
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,200
so many years have passed.

268
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,559
Doctor Li,

269
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,119
please accept our condolences.

270
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,960
We

271
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,599
have disturbed you for quite a long time.

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,919
It's about time for us to leave.

273
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,440
You're leaving?

274
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,479
I've already checked.

275
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,599
The miasma will clear by tomorrow morning.

276
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,960
We can set out then.

277
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,200
Since my wife passed away,

278
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,719
this humble cottage of mine

279
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,520
hasn't been this lively for many years.

280
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,880
Once you leave,

281
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,359
I'll truly miss you.

282
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,359
Doctor Li,

283
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,640
once we've finished our business,

284
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,960
we'll come back to visit you.

285
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,320
That's good.

286
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,479
That's good.

287
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,119
You have to travel tomorrow.

288
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,359
Get some rest early tonight.

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,359
I'll take my leave now.

290
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
Lu Jiu

291
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,679
Are you asleep?

292
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,719
Not yet.

293
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Tell me,

294
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,679
how many relationships in this world

295
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,000
can be as good as Dr. Li and his wife?

296
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,159
Yeah.

297
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,440
You envy them, don't you?

298
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,919
Of course I do.

299
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,559
And there's also Madam Jiaotou.

300
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,359
Even though she was driven to kill for money,

301
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,799
her feelings for her husband and child

302
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,520
are deeper than most people could ever have.

303
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,559
It's just a pity she trusted the wrong person.

304
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,719
Jia Changyi, a grown man, can't even earn money.

305
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,080
He even made his wife sell herself for money.

306
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,840
In the end,

307
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,239
affection is

308
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,960
the least valuable thing in this world.

309
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,520
You think everyone is like you,

310
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,119
measuring everything by money.

311
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,200
Let me tell you,

312
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,080
you—

313
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,320
Why are you so close to me?

314
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,799
I'm just afraid—

315
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:45,919
What are you afraid of me for?

316
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,599
Didn't you already block the blanket?

317
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,559
Can you two stop arguing?

318
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,320
I thought if you two slept together,

319
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
your relationship would improve.

320
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,320
And you'd get along peacefully.

321
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,479
Who wants to get along with him?

322
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
Who wants to get closer to him?

323
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,479
And sleep together?

324
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,679
Give it to me.

325
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,239
Where's Linlang?

326
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,359
I haven't seen her since early morning.

327
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,479
Yesterday, in Dr. Li's medicine cabinet,

328
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
a few herbs were running out.

329
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,320
Maybe she went up the mountain to gather herbs.

330
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,359
So what were you doing so early in the morning?

331
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,479
Dr. Li said he’s always liked medicinal wine.

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,760
I brewed two jars for him.

333
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,640
It should be ready to drink in a few days.

334
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,679
I didn’t expect

335
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,840
you’d do something like this,

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,280
something that doesn’t make money.

337
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,599
Linlang and I are both grateful and repay kindness.

338
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,599
Unlike some people,

339
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
who freeload food and drink all day,

340
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,840
and do nothing.

341
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,919
Fine.

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,880
I’ll go fetch two barrels of water for you right now.

343
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,880
To see Young Master Lu Jiu fetch water himself in this lifetime—

344
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,159
that’s truly rare.

345
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,400
If you knew medicine too,

346
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,400
you could do

347
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,159
easy tasks like brewing wine.

348
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,719
Let me tell you, you’re just—

349
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,520
Linlang didn’t go gather herbs.

350
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,280
In the village,

351
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,679
besides you and Linlang, only

352
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,159
Li Mu knows how to make medicinal wine.

353
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,880
But Linlang said

354
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,159
when Ergou harmed her that day,

355
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,719
there was medicinal wine too.

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,159
What is this place?

357
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,559
Why are there so many shamanic medical tools here?

358
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
It must have been dead for several years.

359
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,840
Yet it’s so well preserved.

360
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,440
A corpse.

361
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,359
Western region shamanic tools.

362
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,799
The corpse found in the tomb was missing its organs.

363
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,080
So that’s the reason.

364
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,039
Look.

365
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
This is your favorite flower.

366
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,760
I just picked it.

367
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
Do you like it?

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Miss Xu

369
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,719
Since you've come

370
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,760
why leave in such a hurry?

371
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760
Lu Jiu

372
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,280
How is it?

373
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,800
I've asked everyone in their village

374
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,959
No one has seen them

375
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,439
Let's go

376
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,719
Let's check the cemetery

377
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,920
What did you do to me?

378
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,719
Don't worry

379
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,520
It's just some paralytic powder

380
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,079
It only makes your arms and legs unable to move

381
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,359
So it was you who used Ergou to kill

382
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,560
You don't really believe in that Western sorcery

383
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,040
about reviving the dead by exchanging organs, do you?

384
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
I knew I wasn't wrong about you

385
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,119
With just a few glances

386
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,400
you could see through the secret behind it

387
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,760
A doctor's principles

388
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,119
This is sorcery.

389
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,599
This is not sorcery.

390
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
The Compendium of Materia Medica says,

391
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,880
Blood is like water.

392
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,800
Grains and water enter the middle burner.

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,439
They are separated and steamed.

394
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,079
Their essence is refined.

395
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,359
It rises to the lungs.

396
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,560
It flows throughout the body.

397
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,239
And disperses outward.

398
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,479
The principles of qi and blood are meant to save lives.

399
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,839
Not to take them.

400
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,479
That's just how Central Plains doctors are.

401
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,719
They only seek stability.

402
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,400
I've tried many times.

403
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,880
Although each time,

404
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,560
it's always just a little off,

405
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,119
but it works.

406
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,319
You killed them and took their organs

407
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,319
just to save your wife.

408
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,839
You are unworthy to be called a doctor.

409
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,359
Do you think I wanted this?

410
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,520
She and I

411
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
once vowed to heal the world.

412
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,760
To cure illness and save lives.

413
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,160
So at first,

414
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,839
I experimented only on myself.

415
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,000
By the way,

416
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,439
Li Mu

417
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,640
because he can't see,

418
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,959
it's hard for him to move bodies.

419
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,520
That's why he asked Ergou for help.

420
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,319
He wouldn't take Linlang

421
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,439
so far away, would he?

422
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
You mean...

423
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,920
Your eyes

424
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,920
are just that blind.

425
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
Even so,

426
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,439
I still couldn't save her.

427
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,920
I've been thinking,

428
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
maybe only a woman's organs

429
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,239
can bring her back to life.

430
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,839
I searched for her

431
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,560
the strongest heart,

432
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,319
the most delicate fingers,

433
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,040
the brightest eyes.

434
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,920
If one wasn't enough, I tried two.

435
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
If two weren't enough, I tried three.

436
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,359
In the end,

437
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,719
she needed more and more organs.

438
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,400
I had to find a helper.

439
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,280
Let's see if you'll open your eyes from now on.

440
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,359
I'll see if you learn to see.

441
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,839
Darn it, I'll beat you to death, you crazy fool!

442
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,800
Alright, that's enough, let's go, it's over.

443
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,920
Let's go.

444
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,439
Remember,

445
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,239
you're not wrong.

446
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,959
They're the ones who are wrong.

447
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,719
They're the ones who are wrong.

448
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,199
They're the ones who are wrong.

449
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,800
They're the ones who are wrong.

450
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,160
They're the ones who are wrong.

451
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,199
They're the ones who are wrong.

452
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,479
They're the ones who are wrong.

453
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,479
They're the ones who are wrong.

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,959
Those who are wrong

455
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,319
all deserve to die.

456
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,479
All deserve to die.

457
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,199
All deserve to die. All deserve to die.

458
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,839
All deserve to die.

459
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,560
Here.

460
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,040
Now is your chance for revenge.

461
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,520
Let you hit me.

462
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Let you hit me.

463
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:02,959
Let you hit me.

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,040
Let you hit me.

465
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,040
Let you hit me.

466
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,400
Let you hit me.

467
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,959
Let you hit me.

468
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,239
Let you hit me.

469
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Let you hit me.

470
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,680
Then why did you use Ergou?

471
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,479
He was never meant to go down this path.

472
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,920
I was helping him.

473
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,719
Without me,

474
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,079
he would still

475
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,880
be bullied by those people.

476
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,199
Anyway, they all deserve to die.

477
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,400
Once they're dead, I can use them.

478
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,520
At least their lives won't have been wasted.

479
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,719
I won't let you succeed.

480
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Lu Jiu and Sima Kong

481
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,199
will definitely come to save me.

482
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,439
Save you?

483
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,400
By the time they see you again,

484
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm afraid they won't even recognize you.

485
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,760
What are you going to do to me?

486
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,119
I replaced all her organs.

487
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,079
But it was still useless.

488
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,520
On the contrary,

489
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
it made her body

490
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,439
overburdened.

491
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,479
As a result,

492
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,319
she couldn't be kept alive any longer.

493
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,719
You know, evil deeds will bring about your own downfall.

494
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,359
Don't rush.

495
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,920
Just when I was about to give up,

496
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,400
you appeared.

497
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,880
Your kindness,

498
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,239
your unwillingness to give up,

499
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,119
are exactly the same as hers.

500
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,920
So I thought,

501
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
if I can't save her body,

502
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,880
saving her face

503
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,599
would be just as good.

504
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,359
You want to give her my face.

505
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,280
Right here.

506
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,880
What kind of lock is this?

507
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,319
It looks so strange.

508
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,760
It's the most intricate lock in the world.

509
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,719
The Nine Linked Rings.

510
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:37,959
Without the key,

511
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,640
only someone inside can open it.

512
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,560
Don't you pride yourself on your skills?

513
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,520
Can you unlock it?

514
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,439
Yes.

515
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,040
But I need three days.

516
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,239
If you could just kick it open,

517
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,760
what's the point of the Nine Linked Rings?

518
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,160
I have a better idea.

519
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,719
What are you making me drink?

520
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,079
Damn it.

521
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,880
This is your brilliant idea?

522
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,079
This door really is sturdy.

523
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,199
Even after the explosion, it didn't open.

524
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,479
Give me one more chance.

525
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,319
Enough, enough.

526
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
If you use more explosives,

527
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,959
what if you hurt Linlang?

528
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,760
Who?

529
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,000
Leave this to me.

530
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,199
You go in and save Linlang first.

531
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,040
Linlang!

532
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,800
Lu Jiu!

533
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,119
Lu Jiu!

534
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Lu Jiu!

535
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,959
Lu Jiu!

536
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,959
Are you alright?

537
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,079
Linlang!

538
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,800
I will definitely get you out of here.

539
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,239
If it weren't for me...

540
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,719
I'm the reason you're trapped here.

541
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,560
Open your mouth.

542
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:20,959
What are you doing?

543
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Sima Kong said there's only one of these pills.

544
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You gave it to me.

545
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,040
What about you?

546
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,319
As long as you're safe,

547
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,319
that's better than anything.

548
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,359
Lu Jiu.

549
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,880
Lu Jiu.

550
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,719
How are you?

551
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,079
Don't scare me, Lu Jiu.

552
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,400
Wake up!

553
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,319
I still have so much to say to you.

554
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,040
I won't let you die.

555
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,599
Lu Jiu.

556
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,800
Lu Jiu.

557
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,839
You're awake.

558
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,079
Don't worry.

559
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
For you,

560
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,359
I'll live well too.

561
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,680
Lu Jiu.

562
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,000
Sima Kong is still outside.

563
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,760
We need to get out quickly.

564
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,280
We've been waiting for days.

565
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,239
Why is there still no news?

566
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:41,719
Sir.

567
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,160
Maybe we should...

568
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,959
You've been standing guard every night these past two days.

569
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,839
You must be exhausted.

570
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,800
Since everyone is here,

571
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,760
I'll send you all on your way together.

572
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
Not necessarily.

573
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,400
This blind man

574
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,479
hides his true martial arts skills.

575
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,160
It's a bit difficult for me to handle him alone.

576
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,280
Three against one is more worthwhile.

577
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,359
You're already at a disadvantage.

578
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,400
I gave your medicine to Linlang.

579
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,520
It's not a loss for her to take it.

580
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,000
Lu Jiu

581
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,199
Hurry and take Linlang away.

582
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:50,079
Leave this to me.

583
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,319
Enough talk.

584
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,319
Lu Jiu

585
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,920
Lu Jiu

586
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,000
Quick, take Linlang away.

587
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,839
Go!

588
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,119
We can't leave Sima Kong alone.

589
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,359
I know.

590
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,319
Lu Jiu, don't do anything foolish.

591
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,560
Letting the ones you care about escape danger

592
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,400
isn't foolish.

593
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,599
You said before

594
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,359
that for my sake, you would take care of yourself.

595
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,760
Lu Jiu

596
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,439
Let me make a bet with you.

597
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,160
If I win,

598
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,680
you'll treat me to candied hawthorn for a lifetime.

599
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,040
Lu Jiu

600
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,959
If I lose,

601
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,319
I just hope you can remember

602
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,119
that there was once someone named Lu Jiu

603
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
who appeared in your life.

604
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,199
Want to die?

605
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,400
I'll help you on your way.

606
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,160
Stop!

607
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,719
You want to kill him.

608
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,880
But have you asked me?

609
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,959
Why did you come back?

610
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,239
Even when beating a dog, you have to consider its master.

611
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,079
You work for me.

612
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,400
If he bullies you, isn't he bullying me too?

613
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,959
You're the real dog here.

614
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
Even with one more person,

615
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
you're still no match for me.

616
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,199
Who said there's only one more?

617
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,959
I'm here too.

618
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
You actually came back on your own.

619
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,400
That nine-linked lock,

620
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,760
isn't it impossible to open from the outside?

621
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,439
Did you forget? I'm incredibly strong.

622
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,479
The door you couldn't blow open,

623
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,880
I took it apart easily.

624
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,119
You two idiots.

625
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,319
I've been struggling to hold on here.

626
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,959
It's not so you two could come back and get yourselves killed.

627
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,239
Enough talking.

628
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,119
Let's hurry up and bring Li Mu to justice.

629
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,800
Just the three of you?

630
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,239
You really overestimate yourselves.

631
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:42,800
Lu Jiu.

632
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,719
I understand now.

633
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,719
He's in a hurry to swap my face with the corpse's.

634
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
It's because the corpse

635
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,959
won't last much longer.

636
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,319
Then let's stall for time.

637
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,280
This way,

638
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,239
his evil plan won't succeed.

639
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,719
Linlang.

640
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Linlang.

641
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,439
Are you okay?
