1
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,080
I'll beat you to death.

2
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,440
Get away from me.

3
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,360
Still running? I'll beat you to death.

4
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,000
Something feels off.

5
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
Why do the people here

6
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,479
seem so hostile toward us?

7
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,559
Yeah.

8
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,839
It's them.

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,039
Quick, catch them!

10
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,839
Stop! Don't run! Don't run!

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,800
Don't run.

12
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,880
Stop.

13
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,720
Don't run.

14
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,600
Don't run.

15
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,960
They're here! Right here!

16
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,240
Don't run! Block them!

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Catch him!

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Come out! Where are you running?

19
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,839
Come out! Come out!

20
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,639
Hurry up and come out!

21
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,320
Why aren't they coming in after us?

22
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,639
Did you hear that?

23
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,919
Come out... Could it be

24
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,880
there's something strange about this house?

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,279
If I weren't injured,

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,279
I'd show you what I'm capable of.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,119
Shut up.

28
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,399
Linlang.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,639
You're strong.

30
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,160
You can handle a few of them, right?

31
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,880
But we still don't know what's going on.

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,759
We can't hurt innocent people.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
We're not even sure if they're innocent.

34
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,479
That assassin last time

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,600
was also dressed as a carpenter.

36
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,759
We have guests.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,600
Doctor Li.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,639
Be careful.

39
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,160
These people are acting suspiciously.

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
You can tell they're not good people.

41
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm afraid,

42
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,240
they're the ones who kidnapped the women from our village.

43
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,399
We're taking them to the village chief for questioning.

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
If you're going to frame someone, you need evidence.

45
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,559
The three of us just arrived here.

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,639
We only wanted to

47
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,119
find a place for our friend to rest and recover.

48
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,039
Just now,

49
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,520
there may have been some misunderstanding.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,800
A misunderstanding?

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,479
If you weren't guilty, why did you run?

52
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,720
I clearly saw the one in blue holding a knife, trying to attack us.

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,039
I didn't!

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,559
You're just trying to argue your way out.

55
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,839
The village chief is here.

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
You're here, Chief.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,559
What exactly happened here?

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Chief,

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
these people are acting suspiciously.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,799
Doctor Li,

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,279
Our village is shrouded in miasma all year round.

62
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,640
Only the villagers

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,519
know when the miasma clears.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
and can come and go safely.

65
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,920
How did you get in?

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,920
It's just miasma, what's the big deal?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
If I hadn't— Enough! Be quiet.

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,559
We entered your village by mistake and apologize for the disturbance.

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,119
We were being chased by bandits,

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,200
and ended up here by accident.

71
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,839
Please, let us go.

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,399
You can lie,

73
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,920
but you can't fake an injury.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,559
Doctor Li is highly respected.

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
Let him verify it.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,399
Alright.

77
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,160
Judging by your pulse,

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,679
the upper right part of your chest

79
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,079
has suffered a heavy blow.

80
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,359
The force penetrated deeply,

81
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,279
causing damage to your sternum.

82
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,119
There must be blood congestion.

83
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,440
It's both an internal and external injury.

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,559
You can tell the external injury just from the pulse.

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
Doctor Li Mu

86
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,119
is our miracle doctor.

87
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,000
Whenever anyone here falls ill,

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,279
he cures them with his medicine.

89
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,799
Stay here and rest for a few days.

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,559
Let me

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
take good care of you.

92
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll follow your advice, then.

93
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,160
Alright.

94
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,760
Let's go back.

95
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,799
Listen to the village chief.

96
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,559
Let's go, let's go.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
Doctor Li

98
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Your home is so elegantly decorated.

99
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,519
And there are so many beautiful flowers.

100
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
My late wife was just like you,

101
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,559
she loved flowers.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,720
So,

103
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,559
I pick some every day to place in the house.

104
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,920
It's just a pity

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,119
that she passed away many years ago.

106
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,880
You can't see,

107
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,880
so how do you know

108
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,239
that she liked flowers?

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
The senses are connected.

110
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,239
When you can't see,

111
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,440
your sense of smell becomes more sensitive.

112
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,600
I can smell

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,079
a faint floral scent

114
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,640
coming from this young lady.

115
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,920
So I guessed

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,600
that she must like flowers.

117
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,000
That's a scented pill my father made for me.

118
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,119
Although I don't need it anymore,

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,119
whenever I think of him,

120
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,000
I take a couple out to eat.

121
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
Also,

122
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,920
I lost the keepsake my father left me.

123
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,799
Miss, don't be sad.

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,640
As long as you keep him in your thoughts,

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,519
he will still live on in this world.

126
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Doctor Li,

127
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
please don't be so formal.

128
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,640
Just call me Linlang.

129
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Your medical skills are exceptional.

130
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,920
I've also studied a bit of medicine.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,399
I can assist you.

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,920
Medicine is profound, and learning never ends.

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,119
There are still many things I don't understand.

134
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
Just like this gentleman,

135
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,320
Mr. Lu Jiu,

136
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,119
his hearing is extraordinary.

137
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,640
Even better than mine,

138
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,959
which is quite sensitive for a countryman.

139
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,920
I suppose

140
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,399
he is no ordinary person.

141
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,119
They say doctors are compassionate.

142
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,519
Doctors never ask about a patient's background.

143
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,160
So why

144
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,760
does Doctor Li need to investigate our background

145
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,200
before taking us in?

146
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,119
Just now,

147
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,799
I was being rude.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,640
But I

149
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,640
meant nothing else by it.

150
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,200
If it weren't for Doctor Li just now,

151
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,040
we would have been caught by those villagers.

152
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,720
Doctor Li,

153
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,760
please don't mind what he said.

154
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,320
Please help treat him.

155
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,359
Alright.

156
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,959
Sir, please come inside.

157
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,160
Linlang,

158
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,279
look,

159
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,079
I...

160
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,000
Look at you,

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,279
your face is covered in ash just from making a fire.

162
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,359
Don't misunderstand.

163
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm just used to being a coroner.

164
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm not used to things being dirty.

165
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,200
Then,

166
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,440
just now,

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
you were so agitated.

168
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,399
I was just laughing at how you don't know how to do anything or tell grains apart.

169
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,480
You tried to start a fire with wet wood.

170
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,760
No wonder there was so much smoke.

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,720
There's a difference

172
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,239
between dry and wet firewood.

173
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,440
Young Master Lu,

174
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,960
you're used to having everything done for you.

175
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,239
Let me handle these small things.

176
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,640
That's true.

177
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,679
These past few years at the Lu residence,

178
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,760
I've had my father and brother to protect me.

179
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,359
I can't even manage the basics of life anymore.

180
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,919
But now,

181
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,400
my father ignores me,

182
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,159
and my brother is missing.

183
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,039
Lu Jiu,

184
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,000
don't be sad.

185
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,640
I'll always be here for you.

186
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,119
Oh no,

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,840
I almost forgot Sima Kong's medicine.

188
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,599
You...

189
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,840
What did you mean just now?

190
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,159
I didn't mean anything.

191
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,799
We're all good friends.

192
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,440
I,

193
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,400
and Sima Kong,

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
will always be here for you.

195
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Who else?

196
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm going to deliver Sima Kong's medicine.

197
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,640
Miss Xu, your breathing is so rapid.

198
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,719
Do you need me to examine you?

199
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,559
No, no, that's not necessary.

200
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,159
Are you alright?

201
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,520
What could possibly be wrong with me?

202
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,919
Did Lu Jiu bully you?

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,119
How could that be?

204
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,239
I'm so strong,

205
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
how could he possibly bully me?

206
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,039
Young Master Sima.

207
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,840
Your pulse is so intense.

208
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,679
Could I have made a mistake in my diagnosis?

209
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,159
No.

210
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
No.

211
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,880
How about this:

212
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,679
I'll go to the back and adjust your prescription.

213
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,599
Actually, there's something

214
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,239
I've always wanted to return to you.

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
What is it?

216
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,719
I thought I'd never see it again.

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,359
That day, I took it on purpose.

218
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,039
I wanted to lure you to look for it alone.

219
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,799
So I could use the chance to shake you off.

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,799
It's alright.

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,239
I can understand.

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,799
So now,

223
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,359
can I help you apply the medicine?

224
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,400
Can you be a bit gentler?

225
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,679
What's wrong now?

226
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,359
Nothing's wrong.

227
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,679
I'm changing his bandages.

228
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,960
Changing bandages?

229
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,479
Alright.

230
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,840
Be careful, don't let your wound reopen.

231
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
I think

232
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,400
the wound has already reopened.

233
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,799
Really.

234
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,039
Let me check it for you again.

235
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,000
(Add money.)

236
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,520
(I'm not adding.)

237
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,679
(Are you adding or not?)

238
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
(Not adding.)

239
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,080
(Are you adding or not?)

240
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,080
(I'm just not adding.)

241
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Add.

242
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,520
Add what?

243
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,640
Isn't he sick?

244
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,559
I'll add a big egg for him tonight.

245
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,400
It's fine.

246
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,679
It's just a minor wound.

247
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,239
I can handle it myself.

248
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:27,960
Are you sure?

249
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:28,840
Of course.

250
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,440
There's another problem.

251
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,239
There's only one bed.

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,559
How are we going to sleep tonight?

253
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
It's such a big bed.

254
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,799
Three people can sleep on it.

255
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,440
Linlang hasn't married yet.

256
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,159
How can she sleep with us two grown men?

257
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,080
Let Linlang sleep on the bed.

258
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,239
The two of us will sleep on the floor.

259
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,359
No way.

260
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
Your injuries are so serious.

261
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,280
If you sleep on the floor, you'll catch a chill.

262
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
It'll be even harder for you to recover.

263
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,919
Listen to me.

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,520
You sleep on the bed.

265
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,440
How about the two of us— What do you mean, "the two of us"?

266
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,640
Then what about me?

267
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,080
I'm the patient here.

268
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,000
I—

269
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,239
What's wrong with you?

270
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,880
I—

271
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,159
I'm dizzy.

272
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,320
Looks like there's only one solution.

273
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,840
Now you've got what you wanted.

274
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,119
At least,

275
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,119
someone's dirty thoughts

276
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
didn't get fulfilled.

277
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
Who's got dirty thoughts?

278
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,880
I was just talking.

279
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,640
I don't care.

280
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,679
Anyway,

281
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,239
stay away from Linlang.

282
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Why are you laughing?

283
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,559
I'm laughing at you.

284
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,280
You're always calm and collected,

285
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,679
but when it comes to her,

286
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
you lose your composure because you care.

287
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,119
It wasn't easy to meet Linlang,

288
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,479
someone who truly cares about me.

289
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
She's so sincere,

290
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,679
so of course I'm sincere with her too.

291
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,239
When I was thirteen,

292
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,520
I had a serious illness.

293
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,359
When I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.

294
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,440
I always felt that the people around me

295
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
all had ulterior motives.

296
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,440
I never wanted to open up.

297
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,359
Until I met Linlang.

298
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,520
It was her

299
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
who taught me

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,640
that you have to live for yourself.

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,359
What is this?

302
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,320
The antidote.

303
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,599
Since the poison keeps you in check,

304
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,919
why should I waste any more effort?

305
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,080
Who is it?

306
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
It's me.

307
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,599
I made some steamed eggs.

308
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,760
Do you want some?

309
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,799
It's so late, we're already in bed.

310
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,719
Sorry.

311
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,119
My eyesight isn't good.

312
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,679
I didn't realize it was so late.

313
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,799
Then I won't disturb you.

314
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,679
It's fine.

315
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Doctor Li, wait a moment.

316
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,960
I'm actually hungry.

317
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
I'll come out right away.

318
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll leave it in the kitchen for you.

319
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm hungry too. Wait.

320
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,880
You're sick right now, you can't eat eggs.

321
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,640
Ever since your last fever, your ears have become unusually sensitive.

322
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,679
If you get another fever,

323
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,080
you might end up with super hearing.

324
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,880
That's true.

325
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,280
I'll go to Doctor Li's medicine cabinet and find you some herbs.

326
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,559
I'll make you some porridge with them tomorrow morning.

327
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,400
Alright, sleep.

328
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Village chief.

329
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,359
You really let those people stay?

330
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,280
Doctor Li is watching them, it's fine.

331
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Those of us with families haven't complained.

332
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,440
Why are you, a bachelor, so worried?

333
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:52,080
I may not have a wife at home,

334
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,239
but lately,

335
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,280
several women have gone missing in the village.

336
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,159
I'm scared too.

337
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:08,880
Sir

338
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,000
Have some hot soup to warm yourself up.

339
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,400
Deep in the mountains and wild forests,

340
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,559
where would soup come from?

341
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,479
I specifically had someone buy it from a nearby town.

342
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,559
I didn't know that the people from the Investigation Bureau

343
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,039
had all become the Princess's subordinates.

344
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,840
Sir, I was wrong.

345
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,520
I, Geng Zhao, sheltered a criminal,

346
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,359
colluded with officials,

347
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,919
and didn't follow proper procedures.

348
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not worthy of drinking the Princess's soup.

349
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,760
You said before

350
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,960
there is no Princess here,

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,119
only Bai Yu.

352
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,960
I was young and ignorant before.

353
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,320
You are generous and don't hold grudges against the petty.

354
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,799
Please forgive me.

355
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,880
Sir,

356
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,640
you taught me to speak less and do more.

357
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,479
I've already interrogated Lian Bu Ci.

358
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,960
He's from the Assassin Alliance.

359
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
He said someone offered a high price

360
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,719
to capture Lu Jiu alive.

361
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,640
The Assassin Alliance has always killed for money.

362
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,199
But this time, they want him captured alive.

363
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,479
That's right.

364
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,680
This Lian Bu Ci

365
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
never met the person who placed the secret bounty,

366
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,959
but he said

367
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,359
that person requested as long as Lu Jiu's life isn't endangered,

368
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,719
they can still be ruthless.

369
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,319
This

370
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,520
is really unreasonable.

371
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,680
You've been following me for so long

372
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,280
and finally asked a decent question.

373
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,479
Sir,

374
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,160
can you tell me now

375
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,079
why you pretended to put out a warrant for Lu Jiu

376
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,079
to force him out of the city,

377
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,839
and now want to save him from the assassins?

378
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,239
Have you ever heard of the Wuxiang Treasure?

379
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,079
Of course I have.

380
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,439
The previous dynasty had a legendary treasure and the city of Wuxiang.

381
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,040
It's said that whoever obtains the Wuxiang Treasure will rule the world.

382
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,119
Twenty years ago,

383
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,839
after Fenglei Hall discovered the whereabouts of the Wuxiang Treasure,

384
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
they attempted a rebellion.

385
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,640
The leader of Tianluo, Dugu, was ordered to suppress the rebellion.

386
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,599
Kill.

387
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,640
Everyone knows this.

388
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,560
But do you know

389
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
how Dugu managed to wipe out Fenglei Hall in one move?

390
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,680
He planted a spy inside Fenglei Hall.

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
His name was Li Chu.

392
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,640
He was the second-in-command of Fenglei Hall.

393
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Brothers,

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
let's all toast to Hall Master Luo.

395
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,239
Alright, alright.

396
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,839
Come on, brothers.

397
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,479
Eat and drink well.

398
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,680
Just like the old rules.

399
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,160
I'll fill your cup.

400
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,199
You can really hold your liquor.

401
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,839
Have another bowl.

402
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,920
Kill.

403
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Li Chu

404
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,880
But in the martial world,

405
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,640
no one has ever heard of this person.

406
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,560
After the destruction of Fenglei Hall,

407
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,280
Li Chu

408
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,520
disappeared with the secret of the Wuxiang treasure.

409
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Until a few years ago,

410
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,520
I found out the last place he was seen.

411
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
It was in Luoyang County.

412
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,760
And the Lu family

413
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,359
rose to prominence at that time.

414
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,439
Oh.

415
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,599
Now only Lu Jiu remains from the Lu family.

416
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,880
So you deliberately forced him to leave the city.

417
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,000
Then you plan to use him to find Li Chu

418
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,439
and clues to the Wuxiang treasure.

419
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,079
All the answers

420
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,719
should be with Lu Jiu.

421
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,319
Stop! Stop! Don't run!

422
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,040
Stop! Catch him!

423
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,680
Child

424
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,280
Please gather everyone in the village.

425
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,040
Doctor Li is going to give everyone a free consultation.

426
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
My mother said you outsiders

427
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,439
are not good people.

428
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,719
Let's go.  Mm.

429
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,560
Doctor Li

430
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,400
Because of the missing woman in the village,

431
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,359
we agreed to let them stay at your place for now.

432
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,560
But now they're parading around so openly,

433
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,959
it's making things difficult for me.

434
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,079
Ah.

435
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,280
Fellow villagers,

436
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,479
after spending a few days with them,

437
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,479
I believe

438
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,040
they would never do anything

439
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,359
to harm any of you.

440
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,680
We've always wanted to repay Doctor Li

441
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,959
for taking us in.

442
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,439
But Doctor Li treats you all for free.

443
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,359
So I thought I could use my own medical knowledge

444
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,719
to help lighten Doctor Li's burden.

445
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,079
You know how to treat illnesses?

446
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,359
Just don't end up making things worse

447
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,119
and have people die in your hands instead.

448
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,280
See?

449
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,199
I told you they wouldn't believe us.

450
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,560
Then let's prove it to them

451
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,920
with real actions.

452
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,719
Stop! Stop! Don't run!

453
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,560
Stop!

454
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,000
Catch him!

455
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,839
It really doesn't hurt anymore.

456
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,000
The young lady's medical skills are truly impressive.

457
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,079
I'm just happy I could help you all.

458
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,760
Amazing, thank you so much.

459
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,160
Hurry, hurry! This girl is really skilled.

460
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,319
Go get treated quickly!

461
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,680
Everyone, line up properly.

462
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,640
No need to rush, everyone.

463
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,640
Mother, son.

464
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,079
Don't be anxious, everyone.

465
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,439
How dare you hit my son!

466
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,599
Are you alright?

467
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,319
I'll show you for hitting my son!

468
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,280
That's for hitting my son!

469
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,199
You hit my son!

470
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,239
That's what you get for hitting my son!

471
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,239
That's for hitting my son!

472
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,719
You fool, how dare you hit my son!

473
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,680
Something's wrong! Something's wrong!

474
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,280
Something's wrong!

475
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:02,880
A corpse!

476
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,880
Ah!

477
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,040
I recognize this body.

478
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,400
She was, just a few days ago,

479
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,079
the widow Li who went missing.

480
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,839
The other bodies,

481
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,880
though some are too decayed to recognize,

482
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,640
but judging by their clothes,

483
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,199
we can tell they're from our village.

484
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
They're the women who went missing.

485
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,760
To be honest,

486
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,680
I used to be a coroner.

487
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,760
All these bodies were murdered.

488
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Maybe I can help.

489
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,239
Earlier, when you did massage and bone-setting for us,

490
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,920
that's also a coroner's job.

491
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,719
What bad luck.

492
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,439
If it weren't for you

493
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
Linlang wouldn't have just gained our trust

494
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
only to be rejected

495
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,839
You should be grateful to Linlang

496
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,760
The miasma keeps the authorities from coming in

497
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,160
Right now, only Linlang can help you

498
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,560
We only have one month here

499
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,959
When the miasma clears

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,079
we can finally connect with the outside

501
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
The officials have investigated several times

502
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,199
but haven't figured out the cause

503
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,119
Can you really

504
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,760
help us find the culprit?

505
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,280
I will do my utmost

506
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,359
All the bodies suffered heavy blows to the right temple.

507
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,760
It must have been a left-handed person.

508
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
Left-handed.

509
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Which one of you is left-handed?

510
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,479
Step forward.

511
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,800
Sun Youfu.

512
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,680
Aren't you left-handed too?

513
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,959
Why aren't you stepping forward?

514
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,359
Who said I wasn't going out?

515
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,040
You're the one blocking me.

516
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,680
That's right, he's left-handed.

517
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,239
This body has the shortest time since death.

518
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,839
Judging by the shape of the knife wound,

519
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,479
it should be curved at both ends.

520
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,079
Like a sickle-shaped tool.

521
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,880
So that's really the case.

522
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
That's really strange.

523
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,040
I only punched her twice.

524
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,280
When did I ever use a sickle?

525
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,839
That's true.

526
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,560
There's no sign of a sickle on these bodies.

527
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,640
Even if there were,

528
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,319
every household has a sickle nowadays.

529
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,359
That can't be considered solid evidence.

530
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,560
No wonder, on the day you entered the village,

531
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
you called for some people to lead the arrests.

532
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,439
So you were trying to frame someone.

533
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,800
You all...

534
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,199
You tricked me.

535
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,160
Grab him!

536
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
Let go of me! Grab him!

537
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,439
Miss Xu

538
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
You really are a detective.

539
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,640
Village chief, I'm innocent!

540
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,319
You just admitted it yourself.

541
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,439
And you still claim you're innocent.

542
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,680
I only killed Widow Li.

543
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,560
I just wanted to mess with her.

544
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,239
But then,

545
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,520
she started screaming.

546
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,280
So I...

547
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,280
Later,

548
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,199
someone came.

549
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,680
I quickly hid.

550
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,079
When I came back,

551
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,000
the body was already gone.

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,119
Still trying to argue?

553
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,880
Take him back for a thorough interrogation.

554
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,439
Village chief, village chief!

555
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,719
What about the body?

556
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,760
Isn't there a coroner here?

557
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,479
Come on, let's go.

558
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,719
Use people for moving forward.

559
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,000
Don't use people for moving backward.

560
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
These people

561
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,239
are even more snobbish than me.

562
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,520
At least the case is clear now.

563
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,040
I guess I've done something for this place.

564
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,359
You...

565
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,719
Aren't you going to ask how I found the tomb?

566
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,000
You'll tell me when you want to.

567
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,439
Let's hurry and take care of the body.

568
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,040
Doctor Li is still waiting for us at home.

569
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,880
In the past,

570
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,680
you always said I wouldn't open up.

571
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,520
Now it seems you're the one doing that.

572
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,560
Why are you coming home so late?

573
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,319
Anyway, the culprit has already been caught.

574
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,839
There's no need to be afraid, no matter how late it is.

575
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,319
They're gone.

576
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,280
Ah.

577
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,439
Hand over the person.

578
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
Hand over the person! Hand them over!

579
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,760
Where's the coroner?

580
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,119
What happened?

581
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,239
Another woman went missing last night.

582
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,000
And that Sun Youfu said

583
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,199
he only killed one person.

584
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,880
Then what about those other bodies?

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,880
Linlang's autopsy and judgment can't be wrong.

586
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,680
Where's Linlang?

587
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,280
I asked her to help me gather some herbs in the mountains.

588
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,880
She left early in the morning.

589
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,439
These are the herbs I just picked this morning.

590
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Crush them and apply them to your body.

591
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,920
It won't hurt anymore.

592
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,119
Have some tea.

593
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,839
Drink some tea.

594
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,319
Drink tea.

595
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Have tea.

596
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,280
Are you blind or something?

597
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:37,880
You, drink tea.

598
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,599
Why did you kill them?

599
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,040
They deserved it.

600
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,839
You're not drinking tea.

601
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,719
I have wine at home.

602
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,119
Medicinal wine.

603
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,839
Drinking it makes you strong.

604
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,239
I didn't expect you to be so vicious.

605
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
I don't deserve pity.

606
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,359
They were the ones who deserved it.

607
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,760
Are you blind?

608
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
I'll beat you to death.

609
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
I'll beat you to death.

610
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,640
Beat you to death.

611
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,119
What are you looking at, you stupid fool?

612
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,640
Hey, you stupid fool!

613
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,959
Go act crazy somewhere else.

614
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,119
I'll beat you to death!

615
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,839
I'll beat you to death, and you're still running!

616
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,880
They're the ones who deserve it.

617
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:56,400
Anyone who bullies me deserves it.

618
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,000
And you too.

619
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:13,880
Sir.

620
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,640
Since we already know that Lu Jiu and the others

621
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,839
disappeared into the Miasma Forest,

622
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
why aren't we chasing them?

623
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,119
Why did we come here instead?

624
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,839
Are you testing me again?

625
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,359
The Miasma Forest is surrounded by mountains and woods.

626
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,479
There's no way to escape.

627
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,239
If Lu Jiu and the others want to keep going,

628
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,719
they have to find a way out.

629
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,439
Here

630
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,719
is the place they must pass through.

631
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,160
But there are too many people and eyes here.

632
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,599
How can we make sure

633
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,040
we don't miss their movements?

634
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,439
Keep your eyes on all directions.

635
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Listen to everything around you.

636
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,319
Be aware of everything nearby.

637
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,880
Firewood.

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,719
Steam.

639
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,719
The wind can't blow it over.

640
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,439
And also,

641
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,119
the waves of aroma.

642
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,119
There's a bun shop just two meters away.

643
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,520
Anyone who isn't blind can see it.

644
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,719
That's hardly a skill.

645
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,439
Sir.

646
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,160
If you're willing to take me as your apprentice,

647
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,880
I promise I won't tell anyone about this.

648
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,040
I, Geng Zhao, never take apprentices.

649
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,880
Sir.

650
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,520
Sir

651
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,959
You were so heroic just now.

652
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,640
Sir

653
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,040
Sir, where are we going?

654
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,040
To an inn
