1
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,639
Linlang

2
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,119
Why are you here?

3
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,000
Stop!

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Didn't you promise me you wouldn't do anything to Linlang?

5
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,080
Which eye of yours saw me do anything to Linlang?

6
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,720
Can't you see I'm still tied up?

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Linlang came over to help me.

8
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,559
I—bang!

9
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
I fell off the bed.

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,039
Really.

11
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,119
Really.

12
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,880
I just got back from buying medicine.

13
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,279
And saw him like this.

14
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,000
It was my fault for tying you up.

15
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,479
I made you suffer.

16
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,800
And I troubled Linlang too.

17
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,880
I'll untie you now.

18
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,399
I have something

19
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,919
I want to tell both of you.

20
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,360
What is it?

21
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,440
The money you gave me,

22
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,160
I lost all of it.

23
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,479
What?

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,240
That was all the money we had for the journey!

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't believe him.

26
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,800
He must have other money.

27
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm not lying to you.

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,199
That was all the cash I had.

29
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,559
I gave it all to Linlang.

30
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,639
If it really comes to it,

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,199
I'll pawn the jewelry and jade pendant I carry with me.

32
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,639
But they're all cheap stuff.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,279
They're not worth much.

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Jade pendant.

35
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,000
It's chilly in the mountains when it rains.

36
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,839
Be careful not to catch a cold.

37
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,839
Sima Kong.

38
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,960
One should respect the order of arrival.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Do you know that?

40
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,039
If we're talking about who came first,

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,399
I was the one who sheltered her first.

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,000
Have you two made enough fuss?

43
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,000
This is the place.

44
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,119
White Pagoda Temple.

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,160
There really is a jade pendant.

46
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's pawn it.

47
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,040
Then we'll have travel money.

48
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,679
Wait.

49
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,640
We can't pawn this jade pendant.

50
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,519
Why not?

51
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,839
Don't you think this jade pendant

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
looks familiar?

53
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,119
It's just like the one we found at Li Mu's house.

54
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,920
They're both account tokens for the Tiebi Vault.

55
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,480
Tiebi Vault

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
You mean

57
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,239
in Lu Jiu's dream

58
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,640
and the other person in his memory

59
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,799
are both connected to Tiebi Vault

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
Tiebi Vault

61
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,399
Nine-brocade Xiangyun Silk

62
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,359
As long as we follow this clue

63
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,679
we can find my previous memories

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720
and the secret behind my elder brother's disappearance

65
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,040
They actually went to Tiebi Vault

66
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,000
The bank run by people from Tiebi Vault

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,480
Based on the information from the past few days

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,440
Xu Linlang has already run out of money for medicine

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,519
If they want to keep going

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,239
it makes sense to go to Tiebi Vault to get some travel funds

71
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,279
That’s reasonable

72
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,480
Sir

73
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Xu Linlang

74
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,519
still hasn’t agreed to your proposal?

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
I just wanted to remind you, sir

76
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,359
not to trust bad people too easily

77
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
As long as Tianluo still has murderous intent

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,880
I can trust Xu Linlang

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,119
Tianluo

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
The assassin we encountered a few days ago

81
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,320
and the one who killed Xu Linlang’s father

82
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,880
were actually from Tianluo

83
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,519
But

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
Tianluo and the Diancha Division

85
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,799
both take orders from His Majesty

86
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,559
Would they dare

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
I understand.

88
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,119
Your Highness.

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Let the lord investigate what happened twenty years ago.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,279
The case of Fenglei Hall.

91
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,959
Could it be that he harbors resentment toward Dugu?

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,119
Twenty years ago, Dugu

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
was ordered to eliminate Fenglei Hall.

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,399
But the Wuxiang treasure

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
has never been found.

96
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,519
Could it be that he wants to...

97
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,920
This humble servant greets Lord Geng.

98
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,160
Eunuch Zhao.

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,880
Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Revenue's home was robbed.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
He specifically sent this old servant here.

101
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,239
He requests that you return to the capital at once to investigate.

102
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,119
Was something valuable stolen?

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,640
Actually, nothing of great value was taken.

104
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,640
I heard it was his concubine.

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
She had an affair with a servant.

106
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,880
And took some silver with her.

107
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Such a trivial matter,

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,279
yet they specifically named Lord Geng to handle it.

109
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,720
Now I remember.

110
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,799
When the Minister of Revenue took office,

111
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,119
all the officials in the capital went to congratulate him.

112
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,160
Only Lord Geng was too busy with his duties to attend.

113
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,679
This time,

114
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm afraid this is personal revenge.

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,200
You, a mere low-ranking constable,

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,239
what,

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,720
are you trying to defy orders on Lord Geng's behalf?

118
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,799
Then let me ask you, Eunuch,

119
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,160
are you following the emperor's orders?

120
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,640
I am delivering Consort Zhou's verbal command.

121
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,440
Who doesn't know that the current consort

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
is Minister Zhou's own sister?

123
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,359
She is pregnant with the imperial heir.

124
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,959
She is in high favor right now.

125
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,279
So this is all about Consort Zhou's family.

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,559
If I recall correctly,

127
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,000
she begged my father to send her to the emperor.

128
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,839
That was only three or four years ago.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,799
I failed to recognize you.

130
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,679
I failed to recognize you.

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,239
I didn't realize it was Your Highness.

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,679
I'm not a princess anymore.

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm the temporary deputy of the Investigation Bureau.

134
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm here to assist Lord Geng Zhao with cases.

135
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,440
You—

136
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,160
A dignified princess like you—

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,839
How did you—

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,880
How did you end up

139
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,440
as a constable in the Investigation Bureau, a job even you look down on?

140
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Darn it, I deserve punishment.

141
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,320
Darn it, I deserve punishment.

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,559
Darn it, I deserve punishment.

143
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,559
Go back and tell the siblings of Noble Consort Zhou

144
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,279
to handle their own family mess.

145
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,160
Stop bothering us.

146
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,040
Yes.

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,839
How is it?

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm more useful than Xu Linlang, right?

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,399
With me here,

150
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,519
no one dares to mess with you.

151
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,160
A single Chiwen coin

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,040
can actually be exchanged for fifty-six taels of silver.

153
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,839
Chiwen coins are the common currency of the underworld.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
They are all minted, stored, and regulated by the Tiebi Vault.

155
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,799
Silver is easily tracked by the authorities.

156
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,640
So those who break the law

157
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,640
mostly use Chiwen coins for transactions.

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Naturally, they're valuable.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
So, in that case,

160
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,679
just that bag of Chiwen coins from Li Mu

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,279
is enough for us to get to Wu Town.

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,959
No wonder you're so generous.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
You let Linlang keep the money.

164
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,479
Turns out, this is just pocket change for you.

165
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
You sure talk a lot.

166
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,119
Now you won't even let me talk? You're something else.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
This is the only way to the Tiebi Vault.

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,280
Maybe Lu Jiu and the others are nearby.

169
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,440
How could things be that coincidental?

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,280
True.

171
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,080
Sit down.

172
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,400
Waiter.

173
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
Bring me one of each of your delicious dishes.

174
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,840
Especially that roast chicken.

175
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,880
It looks so tasty.

176
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,159
Wait a moment.

177
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,239
Just four buns will do.

178
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,479
Alright.

179
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,359
Sir.

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,679
I helped you out so much.

181
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,119
And you won't even treat me to a good meal?

182
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Can you even finish all that?

183
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,039
I'm not a pig, you know.

184
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
Of course I won't eat it all.

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
I'll just take a bite of each.

186
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,960
Just throw away the rest, that's all.

187
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,400
Do you know that all over the world

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,919
so many common people don't have enough to eat?

189
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Alright, I was wrong, okay?

190
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,719
And here I thought you were truly dedicated to the case.

191
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,599
If I had known,

192
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,479
I would have let that eunuch

193
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,000
send you back to the capital on his way.

194
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,559
Sir, why are you trying to send me back again?

195
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,640
I'll just eat less, okay?

196
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,799
Eat.

197
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,559
Hurry up and eat.

198
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,119
The Tiebi Warehouse is

199
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
still some distance from here.

200
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,239
Waiter.

201
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,679
Alright.

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Miss.

203
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,280
This is what that gentleman asked to have packed for you to take away.

204
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,159
Please take it.

205
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:40,960
This person

206
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,640
always has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

207
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,520
The Ironwall Vault of the underworld network

208
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,760
Its account holders span both the criminal and the lawful worlds

209
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,000
The gold and silver stored here far exceed the national treasury

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Yet no one dares to touch even a single coin

211
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
This is the Ironwall Vault

212
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:00,919
That's right

213
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Are you sure?

214
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,799
Such an important place in the underworld

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,359
Is actually near the marketplace?

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,599
The most dangerous place

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
Is also the safest place

218
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
True

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,919
Hidden deep in the bustling city

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
It makes it easier for all kinds of people to come and go

221
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,559
The rules of the Ironwall Vault

222
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,679
One jade token

223
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,760
Allows one person to enter

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,599
Take it

225
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,599
What about you?

226
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll use my own

227
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,799
He said he kept his money in a bank

228
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,080
Turns out it was the Ironwall Vault

229
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,400
No wonder this time

230
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,919
He suggested coming to the Ironwall Vault

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,799
Money is the horse for a difficult journey

232
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,719
Wine is the army to break through a city of worries

233
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,799
Check my balance for me

234
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,559
Your account still has 2,300 red coins

235
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,640
Li Mu is actually so rich

236
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:58,799
No

237
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,359
I checked my own account

238
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,799
So you're a secret millionaire

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,039
Don't look at me like that

240
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
I'm not lending you any money

241
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,159
Let's get down to business

242
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,239
Please come inside, everyone

243
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,599
After so many years

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
Fei Ying

245
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,679
I didn't expect you to show up again.

246
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,159
Come on, place your bets.

247
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,000
Here we go, one, two, three.

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,880
Big.

249
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Control yourself.

250
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't let others notice.

251
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,520
You two are country bumpkins who've never seen the world.

252
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,799
I'm getting more and more curious.

253
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,840
Sima Kong.

254
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
Who are you, really?

255
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,479
You have so much money.

256
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,960
When I asked to borrow money from you before,

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,039
why did you refuse?

258
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
Do you really want to know?

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,039
Of course.

260
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,840
That way I can reflect on myself.

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,159
I'll change whatever I did wrong.

262
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,359
So next time I ask to borrow money,

263
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,520
you'll lend it to me.

264
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,559
It's not that I won't lend to you.

265
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
I don't lend to anyone.

266
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,080
Saving money is my personal hobby.

267
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,719
That's a pretty unusual hobby.

268
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,400
Compared to people,

269
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,799
I think money is more reliable.

270
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
You must have been through something.

271
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
That's why you don't trust others.

272
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,640
But fortunately,

273
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,919
you have us from now on.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,599
Why are you acting like Lu Jiu?

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm nothing like him.

276
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,760
I just wanted to comfort you.

277
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,840
That's all, nothing else.

278
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,359
I don't need your comfort.

279
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,159
Sima Kong.

280
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,679
Why do you always wear a cold mask?

281
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,880
To hide your true self?

282
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Hide?

283
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,039
This is just who I am.

284
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,239
You are hiding.

285
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,119
When you met Li Mu and Lian Bu Ci before,

286
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,280
you risked yourself to save them.

287
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:00,039
No, even earlier at the teahouse,

288
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,559
when you saw someone belittling our group,

289
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,479
you stepped in to help.

290
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,200
You've never been a cold person.

291
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,159
Does it matter what kind of person I am?

292
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,359
Of course it matters.

293
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,960
We're brothers, after all.

294
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,719
Who's your brother?

295
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,799
Once the payment is settled,

296
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
I'll get rid of you right away.

297
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,960
Come, you three, this way please.

298
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,559
This way, please.

299
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,239
Please.

300
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,239
Pay attention and learn.

301
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,200
Please hold this.

302
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,280
Young master.

303
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,479
You may go in now.

304
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,119
This way, please.

305
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,599
Young Master Sima, this way please.

306
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,359
I'll be right back.

307
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Mm.

308
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,640
Understood, understood.

309
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,840
We know the rules.

310
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:15,679
Alright.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,359
No one knows how much money is actually hidden here.

312
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
Here.

313
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,119
There must be more than just gold and silver hidden.

314
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,760
People in the martial world all have some secrets.

315
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,080
Maybe they hide their secret items

316
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,200
here.

317
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,359
This waist token

318
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
was found based on my dream.

319
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,559
Maybe the mystery of my origins

320
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
is hidden here.

321
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,000
Then let's go and try.

322
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,039
Okay.

323
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,359
Sir, you may enter.

324
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,359
Take a look.

325
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,679
The owner of the waist token

326
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,200
does not match the lady's information.

327
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,679
According to the rules of the Iron Wall Vault,

328
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,880
Miss, you cannot enter.

329
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,919
Sorry.

330
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,119
Why can yours go in?

331
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,479
Maybe

332
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,479
I am the true owner of this waist token.

333
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Oh no.

334
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,839
It must be because I helped Lu Jiu hide his identity

335
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,079
and my master found out.

336
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,079
He is using this hidden dart to warn me.

337
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,439
The Tang Sect mission comes first.

338
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,560
Otherwise, I will end up like Lu Jiu,

339
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
becoming a target for the Tang Sect's hidden weapons.

340
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,520
The famous Iron Wall Vault

341
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,719
is actually this simple?

342
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,760
I see.

343
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,880
It's to avoid drawing attention.

344
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
But

345
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,079
for such a secretive place,

346
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,800
it's located in such a bustling area.

347
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,199
What's wrong? I get it now.

348
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,239
Because those who open accounts at the Iron Wall Vault

349
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,959
mostly have money they can't show in public.

350
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,439
Being in a busy area

351
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,920
makes it convenient for all sorts of people to do business.

352
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:08,839
Sir,

353
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,040
do you have anything to add?

354
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,400
You've already said everything.

355
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,400
Is there anything left for me to say?

356
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,640
But the Iron Wall Vault is full of all kinds of people.

357
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,800
We should have brought more people, logically.

358
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,880
Why did you dismiss everyone from the Inspection Bureau

359
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,280
and only bring me along?

360
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,560
Could it be

361
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,040
you're trying to avoid Tianluo's spies among our colleagues?

362
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
That's not the only reason.

363
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,599
Then what else?

364
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,880
Have you heard of a secret recipe?

365
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,239
Would you invite people to watch?

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
A secret recipe?

367
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,959
He's going to teach me his case-solving method.

368
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,640
Why do you look so worried?

369
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,800
Are you missing money?

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,280
Could it be

371
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,239
that someone from the Iron Vault stole it?

372
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,560
They pocketed your money?

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,079
I'll go give them trouble.

374
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,959
It's none of your business.

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,920
Why are you so worked up?

376
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,319
How is it not my business?

377
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,680
Your problems are my problems.

378
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Enough.

379
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,400
The money isn't missing.

380
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,319
But don't think just because I don't need money

381
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,760
you can pay me less.

382
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
That's more like you.

383
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,479
Now it's my turn.

384
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
Did something happen?

385
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,400
I went to ask about it.

386
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,040
I am the owner of this jade pendant.

387
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,959
It seems

388
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,040
my origins

389
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,959
might really be hidden in this vault.

390
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,719
I'll go in with you.

391
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,479
Then I'll wait here for your good news.

392
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:02,959
It's exchanged.

393
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,160
Sir.

394
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,239
Why are you so slow? I'm in a hurry.

395
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Seize him.

396
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
Iron Vault rules:

397
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,079
Anyone who makes counterfeit coins

398
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,239
is executed immediately.

399
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,599
Murder! Murder!

400
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,000
Making counterfeits here

401
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
this is what happens.

402
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,040
How could you make counterfeits here?

403
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,040
That's how it should be.

404
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,599
Let this be a lesson to everyone.

405
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,000
Outrageous.

406
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,880
Doesn't an execution require approval from the authorities?

407
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,239
That's our rule.

408
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,239
Sorry for frightening you, miss.

409
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,599
I have other matters to attend to.

410
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,319
Miss.

411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
Please do as you wish.

412
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,439
This Tiebi Ku...

413
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,400
really is a lawless place.

414
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,640
Inside here

415
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,400
lies the secret of another part of your memory.

416
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,560
Nine-strand Xiangyun silk

417
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,880
We should thank Li Mu.

418
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,280
It seems your past

419
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,719
is truly connected to Fenglei Hall.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,560
I must have used this

421
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,760
in the tomb

422
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,359
to leave the tiger claw mark.

423
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,920
It fits so well.

424
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
It seems in the past

425
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,760
you often carried it with you.

426
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,479
The road of life is hard; money is the horse.

427
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,040
When worries threaten to overwhelm, wine becomes the army.

428
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,319
You two,

429
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,719
please come this way.

430
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:40,800
This is bad.

431
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,079
Geng Zhao is here.

432
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,199
Linlang is in danger.

433
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
Come, come, place your bets!

434
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,479
Place your bets.

435
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,599
Place your bets.

436
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,400
Place your bets, place your bets.

437
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,319
It's about to start.

438
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,160
Hurry, hurry!

439
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,040
One, two, three, big!

440
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,079
What?

441
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,560
I...

442
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,680
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

443
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,959
Stay close to me.

444
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,040
Miss Xu,

445
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,199
why are you avoiding me?

446
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm not avoiding you.

447
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm secretly searching for Fei Ying.

448
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,920
Fei Ying?

449
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,839
That's right.

450
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Fei Ying disappeared seven years ago.

451
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,000
Actually, he's been hiding here.

452
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,000
What are you doing?

453
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,880
Are you really going to let her face Geng Zhao alone?

454
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,359
Where did your usual wisdom go?

455
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,439
You and I

456
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,839
are no match for Geng Zhao.

457
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,959
At a time like this,

458
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,599
we can only use someone else to do the dirty work.

459
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,439
So I conclude

460
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,520
Fei Ying is right here.

461
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
As for why

462
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,839
there's no trace of Fei Ying in the martial world,

463
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,439
First,

464
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,160
everyone fears Tiebi Ku.

465
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,479
Second,

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,760
anyone who talks too much is silenced.

467
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,160
Why are you looking at me like that, Master Geng?

468
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,479
I didn't misjudge you.

469
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
You make up lies in front of me,

470
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,079
yet remain so calm.

471
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,319
Your logic is clear.

472
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,560
You truly are a promising talent for the Diancha Division.

473
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:12,920
It's just a pity

474
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,199
you overlooked one thing.

475
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,160
Fei Ying's connection to Tiebi Ku.

476
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,160
Take them away.

477
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,959
Take them away, now.

478
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,959
Take them.

479
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,040
Take them away.

480
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,599
Are you blind?

481
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,520
Who are you?

482
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,439
Hit him.

483
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,839
How dare you touch me!

484
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,439
Stop, stop hitting!

485
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,599
Stop hitting!

486
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
Don't hit anymore!

487
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,439
Stop hitting, hold them back!

488
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,239
Stop hitting!

489
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,359
Stop hitting!

490
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
Don't hit anymore!

491
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,439
Stop hitting!

492
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,680
Anyone who keeps fighting,

493
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,079
is not allowed to enter the Iron Wall Vault again.

494
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,439
Why aren't you stopping that person?

495
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,400
Hand over your Iron Wall Vault jade token.

496
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,800
Otherwise, get out immediately.

497
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,000
All land under heaven belongs to the king.

498
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,880
The Investigation Office is acting on imperial orders to arrest the criminal.

499
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,800
Who dares to interfere?

500
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,880
What is the Investigation Office to us?

501
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Both the underworld and the authorities only recognize gold and silver.

502
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,520
Even if Geng Zhao comes,

503
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,640
he would have to bow his head.

504
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,479
That's right, that's right.

505
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,319
I

506
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,160
am Geng Zhao.

507
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,079
He is Geng Zhao.

508
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,959
I don't know where this secret passage

509
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,439
actually leads to.

510
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,599
As long as we don't run into Geng Zhao, anything is fine.

511
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,439
Sir

512
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,040
I didn't expect you to be so respected in the martial world.

513
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:58,599
Then why didn't we take advantage and pursue them just now?

514
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,160
You're a girl.

515
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,640
You need to be careful when working on cases.

516
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't rush into everything.

517
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:05,040
The martial world is different from the court.

518
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,439
Sir

519
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
Were you holding back just now because you were worried about me?

520
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
Is that why you didn't keep fighting with them?

521
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,239
I'm your master, after all.

522
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,599
Is there anything wrong with caring about you?

523
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,040
Master

524
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,839
You agreed to take me as your disciple.

525
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,719
From now on, I'll follow you and investigate cases diligently.

526
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,959
I'll be a good helper to you.

527
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,520
No,

528
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,359
What I mean is,

529
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,239
I won't embarrass you.

530
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,359
But Master,

531
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,719
I've always wanted to ask you something.

532
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,760
All under heaven belongs to the king.

533
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,079
How can there be a lawless place like Tiebi Ku?

534
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,160
The martial world is vast.

535
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,199
It's full of hidden talents.

536
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,479
It's far beyond the reach of royal law.

537
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,359
If the world loses its balance,

538
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,640
and conflict arises between the martial world and the court,

539
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,880
in the end, it's the common people who suffer.

540
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,439
Our investigation bureau

541
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,239
exists to solve these problems.

542
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,479
So,

543
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,959
we can't win by force, only by wit.

544
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,040
Since you call me Master,

545
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,079
I should teach you a few things.

546
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,040
The blueprint of Tiebi Ku.

547
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,079
Master

548
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,000
You really are full of hidden talents.

549
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,079
So it was the shopkeeper.

550
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,560
Why are you pretending to be mysterious?

551
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,439
If I don't act like this, how would I look like a villain?

552
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,040
The shopkeeper really loves to joke.

553
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,079
If you were a bad person,

554
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,959
why would you help us stop Geng Zhao?

555
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,359
Although Tiebi Ku is outside the law,

556
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:36,880
we still can't openly oppose the court.

557
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,119
Coincidentally,

558
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,199
this young lady happened to see something she shouldn't have.

559
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,959
I have no choice but to send out the bodies of you three

560
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,800
to fulfill my duty.

561
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,920
We were also harmed by villains

562
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,319
and ended up wandering the world.

563
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,680
If you dare let me go,

564
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
I, Lu Jiu, will reward you handsomely.

565
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,199
Lu Jiu?

566
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,640
The second son of the richest Lu family in Luoyang County.

567
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,839
The villain who killed his own brother.

568
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,959
Handing you over to the authorities

569
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,760
would also earn Tiebi Ku

570
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,199
a favor.

571
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,800
It seems we'll have to trouble you,

572
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,119
to silence us forever.

573
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Didn't you say

574
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,560
you hate solving problems by killing people the most?

575
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,839
Killing one person to save the three of us

576
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,560
is a good deal.

577
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,959
But we still can't take someone's life.

578
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,479
Back when it happened with Li Mu,

579
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,520
I killed someone just to protect myself.

580
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,119
I don't want that to happen again.

581
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,599
I've guarded Tiebi Ku for decades.

582
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,560
I've seen plenty of people like you.

583
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,599
But forced into this situation,

584
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,719
and still showing mercy,

585
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
since that person,

586
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,560
only you all.

587
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
That person...

588
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,079
So, does the boss mean he's willing to let us go?

589
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,880
If I were that easy to deal with,

590
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,359
this Iron Wall Vault

591
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,199
wouldn't still be running.

592
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,119
Boss.

593
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,040
The Iron Wall Vault holds accounts for many wanted criminals.

594
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,040
They deposit money and open accounts here.

595
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,760
Do you think the authorities don't know?

596
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,839
So what if they do?

597
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,160
The authorities turn a blind eye

598
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,719
simply because they want to use the Iron Wall Vault

599
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,319
to maintain balance in the underworld.

600
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
But Geng Zhao outside

601
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
is the most upright officer in the Investigation Bureau.

602
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,280
If things come to light,

603
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,400
what will happen then?

604
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:17,880
Boss.

605
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,079
Quickly take these three away.

606
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,560
This way, please.

607
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,880
Master Geng

608
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,400
I've heard much about you.

609
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,680
I didn't expect people from the Diancha Division

610
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,319
would also use secret passages.

611
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,839
Our master is upright and honest.

612
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,119
If you hadn't deliberately blocked us,

613
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,239
why would we use secret passages?

614
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,479
I'm the only one in the tunnel.

615
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,079
If Master Geng doesn't believe me,

616
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,239
you can go and see for yourself.

617
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,920
However,

618
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,760
if you can't find the person you're looking for,

619
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
don't blame our Tiebi Ku

620
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
for not giving face to the Diancha Division.

621
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,959
There's indeed no one ahead.

622
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,040
Did we miscalculate?

623
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,640
Boss,

624
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,520
did you really let those young people go?

625
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,239
Aren't you afraid the Diancha Division will settle scores later?

626
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:47,000
Back then, Tiebi Ku was almost destroyed by Tianluo.

627
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,599
Someone spared me.

628
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,880
Of course, I have to return this favor.

629
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,040
and pay it back.

630
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,959
That was really close just now.

631
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,760
We almost got caught by Lord Geng.

632
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Linlang,

633
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,760
What did you say to Geng Chao just now?

634
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,439
Why did he let you go so easily?

635
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,599
I told him

636
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,199
that Fei Ying is in the Iron Wall Vault.

637
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,959
And it's thanks to the bounty notice you brought back.

638
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
Besides the three of us,

639
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,760
I only remember that person named Fei Ying.

640
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:26,040
The Assassin Alliance put such a huge bounty on him.

641
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,760
He must be someone important.

642
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,800
It really fooled Lord Geng.

643
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,479
But

644
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,400
you and Geng Zhao aren't related at all.

645
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,680
Why would he

646
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,640
trust you so easily?

647
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,599
Because

648
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,680
he once asked me to be his informant.

649
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,479
He wanted me to stay by your side.

650
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,000
and report back to him.

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,400
It was that time in the woods.

652
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,599
That's right.

653
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:55,239
You've wanted to join the Diancha Division since you were a child.

654
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,760
Geng Zhao is also your role model.

655
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm just a fugitive.

656
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,079
You were just following protocol.

657
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
I won't betray you.

658
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,959
Then why do you pretend to cooperate with him?

659
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,359
Did Geng Zhao threaten you with something?

660
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,400
No.

661
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,839
Lord Geng has never threatened me.

662
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,479
I actually have to thank him.

663
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
If it weren't for him,

664
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,040
I wouldn't have found out that my father

665
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,560
was killed by the Tianluo people.

666
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,640
Then

667
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
now, you

668
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,079
are planning to seek revenge on Tianluo?

669
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,560
I haven't thought about it yet.

670
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,079
With my current abilities,

671
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,959
I can't possibly compete with Tianluo.

672
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,160
If you're going for revenge, count me in.

673
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,160
At worst, we can join forces.

674
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,319
And take out Tianluo's people one by one.

675
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,079
But if we do that,

676
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
you'll be fighting a losing battle.

677
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,000
I mean— I understand.

678
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,680
But

679
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,119
if our hands are stained with blood too,

680
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,160
how are we any different from Tianluo's villains?

681
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Outside, near the Ironwall Depot,

682
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,880
there are Dianchasi agents lying in ambush.

683
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,079
Let's split up.

684
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
In one hour,

685
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,839
we'll meet up at that hill over there.

686
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,640
Okay.
