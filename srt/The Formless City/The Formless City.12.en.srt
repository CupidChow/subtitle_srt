1
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,559
Father once taught me

2
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,239
when performing an autopsy,

3
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,919
if the evidence is complicated,

4
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,479
as long as you calm your mind,

5
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,600
and focus your thoughts,

6
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
you can find the result you seek.

7
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,160
You won't be distracted by all the external chaos.

8
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,240
Someone's here.

9
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,119
You were right after all.

10
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,399
The assassin saw that we set traps all over the temple,

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
so they'd try to attack from outside.

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
So this is your diversion.

13
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,160
Not too stupid.

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,039
You do have some brains.

15
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,279
But unfortunately,

16
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
you realized it too late.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,119
You two are quite the schemers.

18
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
You even kept me in the dark.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
I had no idea.

20
00:02:58,559 --> 00:02:59,600
We were worried you'd be scared.

21
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,559
That's why we kept it from you.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,360
I understand, I understand.

23
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm always thinking of the bigger picture.

24
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:05,800
Go ahead,

25
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,960
who sent you here?

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,440
You think you're so clever,

27
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,039
why bother interrogating me?

28
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,839
Fine then.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,360
I can't help you.

30
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,839
What are you going to do?

31
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,000
What are you all going to do?

32
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,399
What are you all going to do?

33
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,039
So these are the legendary ten torture devices.

34
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,559
It's said that these ten devices

35
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,839
may look ordinary,

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,119
but each one can make a person

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,720
wish for death but be unable to die.

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,320
I've only heard about it.

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,399
I can't believe you actually have it.

40
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,919
If you like it,

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,039
I'll give you this set.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Really?

43
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,160
Who gives a girl torture devices as a gift?

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,759
But

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,759
today we can let Linlang

46
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,160
try it out herself.

47
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:48,720
You all...

48
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,919
Don't get too arrogant.

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,279
There are people after you now,

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
and it's not just us.

51
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,360
Tianluo,

52
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,360
and Tang Clan,

53
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,000
and the people from the Inspection Bureau,

54
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,279
are all watching you closely.

55
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,559
Even if you kill me,

56
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,160
you won't stay free for long.

57
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,600
So you're from the Assassin Alliance.

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,600
That makes things easier for us.

59
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,960
You tricked me into talking.

60
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,199
But what he said isn't wrong.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,600
All the different factions

62
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,119
have already stepped up their pursuit of us.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,440
We have to move faster.

64
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,079
Sir, this way please.

65
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,239
It's just ahead.

66
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,760
You promised me we'd only talk for a moment.

67
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,760
If the patrol comes,

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,920
I can't take responsibility.

69
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,239
My father

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,519
has already passed away.

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
You people outside

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,559
have no way to restrain me anymore.

73
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,920
Now,

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
you're here to eliminate me completely, aren't you?

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,839
Master Meng, you've misunderstood.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,640
I am Geng Zhao from the Diancha Department.

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,119
I must be quite honored

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
to be able, before I die,

79
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:54,200
to witness the style of the world's greatest detective.

80
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,920
I am investigating a murder case

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
and my search led me to the Tang Clan.

82
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,440
But I discovered that you, Master Meng,

83
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,559
once took on a Ministry of Works project for the Tang Clan

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
and raised objections to it.

85
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,079
So I came to seek your guidance.

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
The Ministry of Works

87
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,000
is nothing but their lackey.

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,239
If you want to investigate the Tang Clan deeply,

89
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,320
it depends on whether you, the great detective,

90
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,920
are afraid of death.

91
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,160
If you're afraid of death, you wouldn't join the Diancha Department.

92
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,600
Go to the Duzhi Department and check the accounts.

93
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,119
The flow of numbers

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,559
never lies.

95
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,440
Thank you for your advice, Master.

96
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,079
The closer you get to the truth,

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,239
the closer you are

98
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,880
to death.

99
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,640
Based on the clues provided by Master Meng,

100
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,920
Tang Sect has indeed repeatedly used the name of the Ministry of Works

101
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,880
to secretly amass wealth.

102
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,640
However,

103
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,799
government projects are lucrative positions,

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,880
and secretly making money

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,679
is not such a rare occurrence.

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,519
Sir,

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,399
why are you paying special attention to the Tang Sect?

108
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,320
The issue lies in

109
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,320
their accounts,

110
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,279
which hide suspicious details.

111
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,959
Around the time of the Fei Ying case seven years ago,

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Tian Luo and Tang Sect

113
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,519
had several transactions

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
under the guise of engineering projects.

115
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
Are you saying that with each transaction,

116
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,959
dirty money became justifiable and traceable?

117
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,519
Before Fei Ying disappeared,

118
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,320
he was seen at the Tianchi cemetery.

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
So this money

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
was actually the burial goods in the cemetery.

121
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,519
But after the incident, Fei Ying mysteriously vanished.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,600
Behind all this,

123
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,000
there must be an even bigger secret.

124
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,959
Just as Father predicted,

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,399
Geng Zhao from the Investigation Bureau

126
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,720
has already traced the Tang Sect to the Ministry of Works.

127
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,440
These foolish people

128
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,559
only know how to wait for others to feed them.

129
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,679
Only when there's a threat nearby

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,760
do they know to fight back.

131
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,920
That's fine,

132
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,320
they can help us uncover new clues.

133
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,119
Sir,

134
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,559
I personally made you a late-night snack.

135
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Just by looking at this

136
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
you can tell it was bought outside.

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,959
It still has

138
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,920
the scent of the pastry shop's wrapping paper.

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,519
I knew I couldn't fool you.

140
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,760
It's not that I was afraid my cooking would look bad

141
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,040
and you wouldn't eat it.

142
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
That's why

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,119
I swapped it out, like a cat for a prince.

144
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
It really does look quite bad.

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,399
From now on,

146
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,760
put more effort into investigating cases

147
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,839
and don't waste time on unnecessary things.

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,519
I am a dignified princess,

149
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,920
and this is the first time I've cooked for someone.

150
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,000
Even my father has never tasted my cooking.

151
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,000
And yet you still

152
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,640
Even though it looks bad,

153
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,679
the taste

154
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,880
is actually pretty good.

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
Stubborn.

156
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,719
Tiger Fist

157
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,520
He really is Fei Ying.

158
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,559
How dare you break into the Diancha Office at night.

159
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,159
Do you know where you are?

160
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,400
Fire! Fire!

161
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,599
There's a fire!

162
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
It's on fire!

163
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,239
Sir!

164
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Sir!

165
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,719
Sir!

166
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Sir!

167
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,719
Sir!

168
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Sir, where are you?

169
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,200
Sir, are you alright? Let's go.

170
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,159
Are you crazy?

171
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,280
You didn't take any precautions.

172
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,320
And you just ran into the fire.

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,559
I knew you were inside.

174
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,840
I wanted to save you.

175
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,719
With my skills,

176
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,280
do I really need you to risk your life to save me?

177
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,080
I...

178
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,719
Weren't you just looking at the case files?

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,159
How did a fire suddenly start?

180
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,960
Someone broke in just now.

181
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,960
The intruder was probably like Fei Ying.

182
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,080
They're both assassins from Tianluo.

183
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,520
Tianluo again.

184
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,359
It seems

185
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,559
we're about to hit their weak spot.

186
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,440
Don't be nervous.

187
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,440
The answer will be revealed soon.

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,719
Yeah.

189
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Once the answer is revealed,

190
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,760
I can go my separate way from you.

191
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,159
Why have you been acting so strange lately?

192
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
It's like Lu Jiu and I

193
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,760
owe you something.

194
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,239
Isn't that because— Enough.

195
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,559
All the clues point to Mist Town.

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,119
After this,

197
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,159
there's still a tough battle ahead.

198
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,080
That's right.

199
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,320
You three have things to do.

200
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,960
I'll leave you to it.

201
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,559
Why do we have to bring him along?

202
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,359
It increases our costs too much. It's not worth it.

203
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:57,919
Might as well kill him.

204
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:58,799
No.

205
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,159
Even though he's an assassin,

206
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,719
we don't have the right to kill him.

207
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,960
Let's wait a while

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,039
and hand him over to the authorities.

209
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,599
Okay.

210
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,440
That's right.

211
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
He was sent by the Assassin League.

212
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,919
We don't even know who's behind it.

213
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,239
Keeping him alive

214
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,080
might be useful.

215
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,880
Time has flown by since we set out.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
It's already late autumn.

217
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Wu Town is famous for its hotpot.

218
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,039
And that's exactly what you wanted to eat.

219
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,239
It'll help warm us up.

220
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,159
Why are you suddenly being so generous?

221
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,159
Do you need me to write an IOU?

222
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Other people would.

223
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,080
But you don't have to.

224
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,559
Then I won't hold back.

225
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm cold too, I want hotpot as well.

226
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,119
Alright.

227
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,520
You don't have any money in your Iron Vault anyway.

228
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
So you'll have to spend mine.

229
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,640
One bowl costs five copper coins.

230
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,119
Put it on the tab.

231
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,760
Why are you charging me?

232
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Because you're thick-skinned.

233
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,919
Me, thick-skinned?

234
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,799
Aren't you even more thick-skinned than I am?

235
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,919
Whoever agrees, that's who I'm talking about.

236
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,359
You're obviously thicker-skinned than me.

237
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,159
Me?

238
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,559
That's strange.

239
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,760
Why is there nothing here?

240
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,520
Makes sense.

241
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,159
In weather this cold,

242
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,559
how could there be mosquitoes?

243
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,119
Even if there were mosquitoes,

244
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,760
they couldn't bite through

245
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,200
your thick skin.

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,799
Alright, alright.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Don't act like a bullied wife.

248
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,679
This Mist Town—

249
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,599
It's in the mountains, lots of snakes, bugs, and rats.

250
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,479
I'll make you two sachets.

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,880
They're for repelling insects.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,799
Here.

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,039
You made this yourself?        Yes.

254
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,919
Of course.

255
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,640
Mine looks better than the one next to it.

256
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,599
Nonsense.

257
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,799
Mine is a masterpiece.

258
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,200
Mine obviously smells better than yours.

259
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,000
Mine looks better.

260
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,039
Mine smells good and looks good.

261
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,640
You two—

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,520
Didn't you notice something?

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,760
Over there.

264
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,119
It seems—

265
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,719
He knew you were tracking him.

266
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,359
You tampered with his clothes.

267
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,239
But why did he strip completely?

268
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,359
Isn't he afraid of the cold?

269
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,960
If he was escaping,

270
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,039
why wouldn't he take his weapon with him?

271
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,719
I really have been here before.

272
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,479
In my brother's secret room,

273
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,520
there's a map leading to Mist Town.

274
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,400
That means he and Father already knew my identity.

275
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
They deliberately kept it from me.

276
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,840
Whether it's true or not—

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,119
We'll know once we go in and check.

278
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,119
There's a heavy sense of gloom here.

279
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,960
Are you sure this place is famous for hotpot?

280
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,919
I haven't seen anywhere to eat hotpot.

281
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,359
But a place for eating people—

282
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,520
That, there is.

283
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
Right over there.

284
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,159
Nothing left but clothes, not even bones.

285
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,159
It must be the Yingshan Witch again.

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,520
But we already held a ritual to appease the gods.

287
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,520
So how come

288
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,559
the Yingshan Witch, who only eats men,

289
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,799
has appeared again?

290
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,919
What a pity.

291
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,559
Master Zhang spent a thousand taels of silver

292
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,200
on that ritual.

293
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,400
Yeah.

294
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,159
So pitiful.

295
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,520
The person was eaten,

296
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,880
but the clothes are still here.

297
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,719
Probably just like what happened with Li Mu,

298
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,119
all a trick.

299
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,640
They were all kidnapped.

300
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,400
What would a little girl like you know?

301
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,960
If you anger the Yingshan Witch,

302
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,200
let's see how you handle it.

303
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,280
Outsiders think they know everything.

304
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,280
Let's go.

305
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,640
Go.

306
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,719
Let's go take a look.

307
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,679
The Yingshan Witch is here!

308
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,919
Everyone, run!

309
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Look how scared they are.

310
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,280
And he calls himself a Taoist priest.

311
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,559
Just putting on a show.

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
Open it and see.

313
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,559
Strange.

314
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,880
Including the scholar killer,

315
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
all the missing people's inner and outer clothes

316
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
were removed.

317
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,799
Moreover,

318
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,440
the clothes were covered with skin flakes.

319
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,640
They were all old clothes.

320
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
They weren't just randomly used to fake things.

321
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,000
So you mean

322
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
they were all kidnapped?

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,280
Then why would the kidnappers strip them completely?

324
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
The only explanation is

325
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,760
at that time,

326
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,000
they couldn't wear clothes.

327
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,599
Couldn't wear clothes?

328
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,200
I once read in an ancient book

329
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,119
about a soul-captivating secret technique.

330
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,840
Those under control must remove

331
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,200
everything related to their past.

332
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,599
Only then can they forget their memories

333
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,719
and be manipulated by others.

334
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,119
Isn't that black magic?

335
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
Who are you people?

336
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,319
You heartless scoundrels!

337
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
You even profit from the dead.

338
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,520
You'll get what's coming to you.

339
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,479
That's right.

340
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,680
You'll be punished for this.

341
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,479
Everyone,

342
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,520
we're not here to steal from the dead.

343
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,479
To be honest,

344
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,719
I'm a coroner.

345
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,000
Based on my examination,

346
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,079
there's more to the missing people in town than meets the eye.

347
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
The rumors about the Yingshan Witch

348
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,800
were just made up by the real culprit.

349
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,239
It's complete nonsense.

350
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,160
I've cultivated myself for many years.

351
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
The founder took pity on my sincerity.

352
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,599
He personally descended to guide me.

353
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,199
That's how we learned the Yingshan Witch brings disaster.

354
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,280
How could a little girl like you

355
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,079
speak so carelessly about this?

356
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
The Taoist is right.

357
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,599
They're blaspheming the gods

358
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
and stealing from the dead.

359
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,000
Arrest them!

360
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,800
Arrest them! Arrest them!

361
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't run!

362
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't run!

363
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,959
Stop! Stop!

364
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,239
Catch them!

365
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,199
Why are we running?

366
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
They're just a few villagers.

367
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,719
I could fend them off by myself.

368
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,719
In the end,

369
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,520
they're just ordinary people.

370
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,719
They're only chasing us because the real culprit misled them.

371
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,719
They've even lost their families.

372
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,119
They're the most pitiful ones.

373
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,599
Lu Jiu said exactly what I wanted to say.

374
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,760
You two really are in sync.

375
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,079
This whole thing is so strange.

376
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,040
We need to examine the body as soon as possible.

377
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,839
So that no more people get hurt.

378
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,760
But

379
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,920
doing this

380
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,319
might affect the reason we came to Mist Town.

381
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:46,920
It's fine.

382
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:47,880
If you want to investigate,

383
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:48,680
I'll do it with you.

384
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:51,239
No.

385
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,520
I just heard from someone in town

386
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,920
that someone spent a thousand taels of silver to drive away the witch of Yin Mountain.

387
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,359
If we solve the case,

388
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
the thousand taels will be yours.

389
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,040
No.

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,359
Not even money can persuade you?

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
That's just Linlang's personality.

392
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
If she says she wants to investigate, she will.

393
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,760
Do as you see fit.

394
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,959
This isn't an ordinary case.

395
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,839
If it really involves some soul-stealing dark magic,

396
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,839
it will be extremely dangerous.

397
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,000
We can't let Linlang take this risk.

398
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,439
Why are you so worked up?

399
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,079
I...

400
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:16,560
Investigate.

401
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,160
If he won't help you, I will.

402
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,520
I...

403
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,239
I've ended up like this

404
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,479
because I was framed.

405
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,359
So many people have gone missing.

406
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,359
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

407
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,760
Lu Jiu.

408
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,280
Alright.

409
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,359
You care about the world.

410
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,199
Only I am the selfish one.

411
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,400
Linlang, Sima Kong.

412
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,760
Just let him calm down.

413
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,000
His package is still there.

414
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,000
I bet within the time it takes for one incense stick to burn,

415
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,560
You two always echo each other.

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm clearly doing this for your own good too.

417
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,359
When did I become like this?

418
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,439
Lord Geng, what do you mean by this?

419
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,319
Tang Clan took on projects assigned by the Ministry of Works.

420
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,800
As for the matter of seizing by force or cunning,

421
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,520
it is not within the jurisdiction of my department.

422
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,719
So I won't ask about it for now.

423
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
I just want to ask Elder Tang,

424
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,359
five years ago,

425
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
regarding this sum of money that went through the Tang Clan's accounts,

426
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
what was it about?

427
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,800
Since Lord Geng has come here,

428
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,040
you must already know the truth.

429
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,199
So why bother asking me?

430
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,439
His Majesty established Tianluo

431
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,760
to stabilize the nation.

432
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,880
But now, Tianluo

433
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,000
has amassed its own forces and grown arrogant.

434
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,400
They secretly raise assassins.

435
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
They bring chaos to the martial world.

436
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,680
The Tang Clan

437
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,760
collects money for them to fund their army.

438
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,040
If you turn away from the darkness now,

439
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,079
I can still plead for you

440
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,199
before His Majesty.

441
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,560
Let me repeat myself once more:

442
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,160
The Tang Clan only takes money to do business.

443
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,079
We never ask about our clients' intentions.

444
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Nor have we ever broken any imperial laws.

445
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
Do you think that by saying this,

446
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,199
you can clear yourself of all responsibility?

447
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,199
If that's the case,

448
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,079
why don't you report directly to the court?

449
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,160
Why come here to question me?

450
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,800
Because you know

451
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,119
Tianluo answers to His Majesty.

452
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,000
You don't dare to be certain

453
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,079
whether this is His Majesty's will or not.

454
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,560
No matter whose orders they are,

455
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,680
I, Geng Zhao,

456
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,839
since the day I joined the Diancha Division,

457
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
have made it my resolve

458
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,239
to serve the people of the world

459
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,400
by investigating cases and seeking justice.

460
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,439
But now,

461
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,439
the martial world is in chaos,

462
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,680
and the people are suffering.

463
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:32,920
I, Geng Zhao,

464
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,359
will never stand by and do nothing.

465
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:38,400
Then I wish Lord Geng a swift resolution to the case.

466
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,160
This is a secret report

467
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,560
that our Diancha Division received today.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,479
I hope that after reading it, Elder Tang

469
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,880
will take care of your health.

470
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,439
Farewell.

471
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,439
My lord,

472
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,719
are you truly not afraid

473
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,239
that Tianluo and Tang Clan might join forces to obstruct us?

474
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,560
What good would fear do?

475
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,920
We can only deal with each move as it comes.

476
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,280
I believe His Majesty will not

477
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,680
be deceived by Dugu forever.

478
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,359
What are you looking at?

479
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,439
My lord,

480
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,520
I think you are the bravest man in the world.

481
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,719
We should focus on our duties.

482
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
Go pack your things right away.

483
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,239
We need to make a trip to Wu Town.

484
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,280
Yes.

485
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,520
By now, Lu Jiu and the others should have already arrived.

486
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,719
We must get there before Tianluo and the Tang Clan.

487
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,760
We need to seize the initiative.

488
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,359
Then hurry up!

489
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,000
It's already been the time of four or five incense sticks.

490
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,199
Why hasn't he come back yet?

491
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,560
That shouldn't be the case.

492
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,520
Let's go.

493
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,439
Let's go check on him.

494
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,400
Sima Kong

495
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,319
Sima Kong

496
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:19,760
Oh no.

497
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,920
Both the inner and outer clothes are here again.

498
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,400
The clothes are still warm.

499
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,239
He probably hasn't gone far.

500
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,439
We can still catch up if we go now.

501
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,079
Let's go.

502
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,839
Where is this place?

503
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,319
It's that scholar.

504
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,119
Who are you people?

505
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,119
What do you want?

506
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,560
There are traces of people passing on both sides.

507
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,599
Let's split up and chase them.

508
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,359
Wait.

509
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,959
The other side must have a lot of people now.

510
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,760
How could I let you take the risk alone?

511
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,839
It's already dark.

512
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,000
We don't have much time left to save Sima Kong.

513
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,359
If they really have some terrifying dark magic,

514
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,520
what could be more important than saving Sima Kong?

515
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
We're really running out of time.

516
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,640
Let's hurry and go.

517
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,479
Be careful.

518
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,160
Oh no.

519
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,479
Sorry.

520
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,199
It's you.

521
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,199
You recognized me.

522
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,800
We just happened to meet on the street.

523
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,079
Although you saved me just now,

524
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,280
what does this mean?

525
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,119
Fei Ying

526
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,119
I'm Ye Mei.

527
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,760
I'm Ye Mei, the one who grew up with you.

528
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,560
Achieving the goal

529
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,520
is more important than the means used.

530
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,560
Since Fei Ying has already brought back the accountant you specified,

531
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,079
Father, please show mercy.

532
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,920
Are you okay?

533
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,520
Senior Sister

534
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,920
Begging for mercy is useless.

535
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,599
Only by surviving

536
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,400
is there hope.

537
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,439
Lu Jiu

538
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,160
Lin Lang

539
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:33,959
Lin Lang

540
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,239
It wasn't what you think just now.

541
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,239
Listen to my explanation.

542
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,400
Right now, I just want to save Sima Kong.

543
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,520
I...

544
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,359
Why bother explaining to her?

545
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,719
I'm the one who grew up with you.

546
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,319
We've lived and risked our lives together.

547
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,040
No matter what memories we shared,

548
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,800
But let me tell you,

549
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,439
I have nothing to do with you.

550
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,760
Stop!

551
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,160
Then what if

552
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,239
I know where your friends are?

553
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,239
They've all arrived.

554
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

555
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,439
We've already followed your plan.

556
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
We're investigating the matter of Yinshan Granny.

557
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,199
The shadow who replaced me in Shuicheng for twenty years

558
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,760
can disappear now.

559
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,719
It's Father.

560
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,760
Lin Lang

561
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,439
I will definitely come out safely to see you.

562
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,560
Who exactly are you people?

563
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,439
What do you want to do?

564
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,479
Miss Xing'er

565
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
The wound has already scabbed over.

566
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,359
We caught more than a dozen people.

567
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,040
Only one has recovered well.

568
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,719
Stamp it.

569
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,640
Mm.

570
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,560
Come out alive.

571
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,920
Only then are you worthy of eating Tang Sect's food.

572
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,160
Master

573
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,040
Let me out.

574
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,479
Master

575
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,400
Master

576
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,079
Master

577
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:26,959
Let go of me.

578
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,400
What are you trying to do?

579
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,680
Behave yourself.

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,680
Didn't you say you'd take us to find Sima Kong?

581
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,560
Why did we come here?

582
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,599
I only said I had a clue.

583
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,119
When did you say that?

584
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,839
He's right here.

585
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,959
Sima Kong is missing now.

586
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,520
I suppose they did it too.

587
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,920
Since they're making a burial mound here,

588
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,079
maybe

589
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,239
we can find something in the clothes he wore before he disappeared

590
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,160
and get a clue.

591
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,040
Release your lonely soul.

592
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
All spirits and ghosts.

593
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:25,760
All beings receive grace.

594
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,520
It's just white phosphorus igniting on its own.

595
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,959
It scared them like this.

596
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,160
I guess they've suffered a lot from the old witch of Yin Mountain too.

597
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,719
It's really pitiful.

598
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,880
You've been busy for so long,

599
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
just to save these foolish people.

600
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,520
No matter what, they're still lives.

601
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,959
How can we just stand by and do nothing?

602
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,920
Useless people

603
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,439
should just die. (Darn it.)

604
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
Right?

605
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,319
I see you and Lu Jiu used to be friends.

606
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,760
You even saved him yesterday.

607
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,959
I thought you were just a bit cold.

608
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,400
I didn't expect you to be so heartless.

609
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,160
He and I are the same.

610
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,199
Don't you think so?

611
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,400
Let me explain.

612
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,040
I...

613
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,719
I just forgot the past.

614
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,719
What happened.

615
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,319
Forget it.

616
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,079
I don't want to hear so much about your past.

617
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,239
No.

618
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:42,719
Linlang.

619
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,160
I knew it.

620
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,800
Even though your memory hasn't returned,

621
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,520
what's in your heart

622
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,400
is the same as what I think.

623
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,319
It's the same.

624
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,199
Right?

625
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,880
Don't act like you know me so well.

626
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,439
I'm not the same as I was before.

627
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,160
But that was still you.

628
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,560
Let's get back to business.
