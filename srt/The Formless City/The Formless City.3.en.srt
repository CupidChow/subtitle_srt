1
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,240
Not eating again.

2
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,679
Linlang, this child...

3
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,600
I watched her grow up.

4
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:22,880
You are her friend.

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,479
Even if I believe you killed someone,

6
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,759
it would only be out of helplessness.

7
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,360
But you still have to eat.

8
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Otherwise, before the officials arrive,

9
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
you might already be gone.

10
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,279
From now on, you’ll be my best friend.

11
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,039
Sorry, I’m a coroner.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,399
I only trust evidence.

13
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,919
Now even my only friend doesn’t trust me.

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
Lu Jiu.

15
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
Lu Jiu.

16
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,240
You can scold me however you want.

17
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,160
I’m just doing my duty.

18
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,919
I have no choice.

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,880
Your duty

20
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,720
is to punish evil and promote good.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,839
To uncover the truth.

22
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,559
Why believe the illusion before you?

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
I don’t want to believe it either.

24
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
But the evidence... Leave.

25
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,759
Sir.

26
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,559
Xu Linlang, you’re going to scare me to death.

27
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,679
I found something wrong with Lu Jiu’s case.

28
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
I’ve been an official for many years.

29
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,919
I don’t need you to teach me how to investigate.

30
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,279
I discovered

31
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,320
someone wants to poison Lu Jiu’s food.

32
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,240
Lu Jiu’s case is already closed.

33
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,199
The person who would do this

34
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,880
must be the real murderer.

35
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:17,799
I suspect

36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,359
he’s afraid the case might change.

37
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,200
So he wants to kill to silence the witness.

38
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,359
This matter

39
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,760
Is there anyone else who knows about it?

40
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,920
I only told Zhao, the head constable who watches over Lu Jiu.

41
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,679
He said Lu Jiu's meals

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,959
are all prepared by the kitchen at the yamen.

43
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,279
No one else has touched them.

44
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,359
But I trust Zhao's character.

45
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,720
He didn't do it.

46
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,320
Alright.

47
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,239
I am aware of this matter now.

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,119
Do not let word of this leak out.

49
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,959
What do you plan to do, sir?

50
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,079
Xu Linlang

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
I know you pride yourself on your abilities.

52
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,000
You have always thought I am incompetent.

53
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,040
But I have my own reasons for being in this position today.

54
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,640
I have my own way of doing things.

55
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,760
You may go.

56
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,440
Then I'll leave it to you, sir.

57
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,359
Useless.

58
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
You were supposed to poison him so the second young master could fake his death and escape.

59
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:16,040
Yet you let a mere coroner ruin the plan.

60
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,480
That female coroner, Xu Linlang,

61
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,839
is also doing this for the second young master.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,760
I heard

63
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,200
she's still trying to overturn the case for the second young master.

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,640
Xu Linlang.

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,480
Now the prison is sealed off.

66
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,720
As for Lu Jiu being poisoned,

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,679
where should I even start investigating?

68
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
What's troubling you?

69
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,880
Maybe I can help.

70
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,320
Craftsman.

71
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,279
Regular customer.

72
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,600
I can give you a discount.

73
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,799
It's just a pity

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,959
you can't help me.

75
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,160
As long as the price is right,

76
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,760
there's nothing that can't be done.

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Lu Jiu is in prison.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
The real culprit is watching closely.

79
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,359
Tell me,

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
how can I protect him?

81
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
Who says there's no way?

82
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,559
At the very least, I can get into the prison.

83
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,799
I can pass a message to your friend.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
But this seems... Don't worry.

85
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,119
In our line of work, we do things for money,

86
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,119
but never break the law.

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Then I'll leave it to you.

88
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,040
No problem.

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,559
But everything

90
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,160
comes with a cost.

91
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,279
As long as I can save Lu Jiu,

92
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,799
I'm willing to spend any amount of money.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,559
Take it.

94
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm a businessman.

95
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
But I'm not a profiteer.

96
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,440
I only make the money I deserve.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
Besides,

98
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,799
I'm heading that way anyway.

99
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,559
On the way.

100
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,239
According to the master's instructions,

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,679
the pharmacy assistant

102
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,320
handed the letter to Xu Linlang,

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,679
and it's already been taken care of.

104
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Alright.

105
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
We absolutely can't let Lu Jiu

106
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,200
fall into those people's hands.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
Hunting live creatures

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,959
is far more interesting than shooting arrows at a target range.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,640
Much more fun.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Toying with people's lives in your hands—

111
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,399
that's even more thrilling.

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,000
There's one more person.

113
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,200
Linlang.

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,279
What are you doing?

115
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
This is the men's mortuary.

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I was being reckless.

117
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,640
I just wanted to learn from you, big brother.

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,040
To learn about autopsy techniques.

119
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,000
I heard that

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
Lu Mingcheng had gallstones.

121
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,640
I wanted to see

122
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,440
those gallstones

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,279
to see if they're like a monk's relics.

124
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,200
As long as we know how he died, that's enough.

125
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,279
Why bother checking that?

126
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,160
Didn't you perform the autopsy?

127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,799
The condition of the body

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,119
matches what the Lu family's servants described.

129
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,200
Didn't you also examine that female corpse?

130
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,359
That was Wan Lingling.

131
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
When they carried her in,

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,679
she was still wearing her wedding dress.

133
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,679
Who else could it be but Lu Mingcheng?

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,239
Who does such a sloppy autopsy like you?

135
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,239
No, I need to re-examine the body.

136
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,239
Xu Linlang.

137
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,200
How many years have you even been a coroner?

138
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,440
I've seen more corpses than you've eaten grains of salt.

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,279
Go, go, go.

140
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,279
Sorry, big brother.

141
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,359
Xu Linlang.

142
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,839
What are you doing?

143
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,079
Put me down! What are you doing?

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,279
Xu Linlang, what are you trying to do?

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,079
Let go of me!

146
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,079
Xu Linlang!

147
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,200
You're breaking the law, you know that?

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

149
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,679
Please bear with me.

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,559
The location matches the medical case provided by the pharmacy.

151
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,359
The deceased is indeed not Lu Mingcheng.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Sir.

153
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,799
Sir.

154
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,239
Xu Linlang, Xu Linlang.

155
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,280
Are you addicted to barging into my study?

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,719
I examined the body carefully.

157
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,640
That male corpse from the Lu family

158
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,000
is not Lu Mingcheng at all.

159
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,400
That deceased person

160
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
is not Lu Mingcheng at all.

161
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
He is actually the missing servant.

162
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,799
But the Lu family’s steward

163
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,760
didn’t mention the disappearance at all.

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Wait.

165
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
You, as a young woman,

166
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,679
examined a male corpse.

167
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,320
That’s against the rules.

168
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,719
If the higher-ups find out,

169
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,080
I’ll be held responsible.

170
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Desperate times call for special measures.

171
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,880
Solving the case comes first. Fine, fine.

172
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,799
Stop making it sound so righteous.

173
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
You know what kind of person you are

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,719
better than anyone.

175
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,599
Don’t you?

176
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,679
Besides, as a coroner,

177
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,799
you’re investigating beyond your authority.

178
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,479
If no one keeps you in check,

179
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
do you want to take my position?

180
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,880
If I’ve done something wrong,

181
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,320
I’m willing to accept punishment.

182
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,280
But there are indeed suspicious points in the Lu family’s case.

183
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,440
If you can help Lu Jiu prove his innocence,

184
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,440
everyone will praise your wisdom.

185
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,440
I don’t need you to tell me how wise I am.

186
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,640
Go.

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
I’ll take my leave now.

188
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,599
Sir.

189
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,799
How many days has it been?

190
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,000
The seventh day after death.

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,159
How do you know?

192
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,799
It's my older brother's seventh day.

193
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,799
It was you.

194
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,159
We met before on the pleasure boat.

195
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,039
That's right.

196
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,119
Why did you come in here?

197
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,320
Just to get away from the world.

198
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,320
Most of the county jail is unused.

199
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,520
There's no profit to be made here.

200
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,799
Some people are willing to pay to stay here for a few days.

201
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
To hide from their creditors.

202
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,400
Why wouldn't they do it?

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,520
If there's another opportunity like this next time,

204
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,880
remember your brother here.

205
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,799
What are you looking at?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,239
Just behave yourself.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Please enjoy.

208
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,400
Actually, someone asked me to pass a message to you.

209
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,359
Beware of villains poisoning you.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,799
Who is it?

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,440
I can't reveal my employer's name.

212
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,880
It's my professional code.

213
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,159
It's her.

214
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,119
It must be her.

215
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,080
Since I can take money to get in,

216
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,440
I can naturally take money to get you out.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
This abyssal prison,

218
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,479
how can one get out?

219
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,760
Someone like me

220
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,400
is better off staying in prison

221
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
and waiting to die.

222
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
The time when the jailers serve food and change shifts

223
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,919
is remembered quite accurately.

224
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,640
Are you trying to report this for credit?

225
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,200
There's no reward for reporting.

226
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,359
It's not worth it.

227
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,679
But helping the wealthy Mr. Lu Jiu

228
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,280
is a different story.

229
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,599
The real culprit wants me dead in prison.

230
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Only by staying alive

231
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,919
can I uncover the truth.

232
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,599
Sir

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,599
What's wrong?

234
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,840
The Lu family's murder case

235
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,400
When will it be reviewed again?

236
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,440
The evidence in this case is conclusive.

237
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,840
There's no need for another review.

238
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,000
But I clearly resubmitted

239
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,400
the autopsy file to you yesterday.

240
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
A new autopsy file.

241
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,440
Hmm.

242
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,719
I didn't receive it.

243
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,320
If you ignore this,

244
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,039
I'll submit it to the Department of Investigation.

245
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,840
Go ahead.

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
Is the Department of Investigation

247
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,479
somewhere a low-ranking coroner like you can report to?

248
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,640
Then I'll go to the Court of Justice.

249
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,640
I'll report it all the way to the Golden Throne.

250
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
Are you trying to rebel?

251
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,039
I hereby declare

252
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,000
that Xu Linlang is stripped of her coroner position.

253
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
You're not an official

254
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,919
and have no right to participate in the investigation.

255
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:09,960
Guards!

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Throw her out!

257
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,760
Hurry!

258
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,559
Yes, sir.

259
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,159
You...

260
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,280
You corrupt official!

261
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,280
One day, I'll make the truth known to the world!

262
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,559
You corrupt official!

263
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,840
Let go!

264
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,039
Corrupt official!

265
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,159
Shift change.

266
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,119
I'm exhausted.

267
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,520
You know, I have to admit,

268
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,400
the steamed buns in this prison

269
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,520
aren't half bad.

270
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,840
That's more like it.

271
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,640
Here,

272
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,479
whether you're a commoner

273
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
or a wealthy young master,

274
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,760
after a few days of prison food,

275
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,599
even a bun dropped on the ground

276
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,400
starts to smell delicious.

277
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm leaving, brother.

278
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:54,840
What is it?

279
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:55,919
Changed your mind?

280
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,440
Seizing a jailer

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,640
and taking his keys

282
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,159
is something anyone could think of.

283
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,440
I didn't expect you to be so observant.

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,080
The spoiled young master everyone sees, Lu Jiu,

285
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,559
is just an act after all.

286
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Same goes for you.

287
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Weren't you just pretending to grab the keys

288
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,719
to see how I'd react?

289
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,119
Who says so?

290
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,119
Look at what's in your hand.

291
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,679
A prison defense map.

292
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,119
That's not all.

293
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,679
You're not leaving.

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
Are you plotting something against me?

295
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,400
Luoyang County is just a tiny place.

296
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,400
Escaping in broad daylight

297
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
is basically asking for death.

298
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,760
So you're just letting this chance slip by?

299
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,679
Rest and gather your strength,

300
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,000
wait for the right moment.

301
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,400
True enough.

302
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,239
Lu Kun once stirred up the martial world single-handedly.

303
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
His son

304
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,799
couldn't possibly be an ordinary man.

305
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,440
Sir

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,799
It's me

307
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,479
Sir

308
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
Sir, don't run away

309
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,719
Sir

310
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,919
You must be wondering

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,679
how I followed you to Luoyang County

312
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,479
That's because I'm your assistant

313
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,359
I heard you came to Luoyang County quietly

314
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
Of course I had to hurry and catch up

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,320
A temporary assistant

316
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,960
So you care so much

317
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,440
about the details related to me

318
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,840
Sir

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,880
Tell me

320
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,799
The Investigation Bureau has always had strict requirements for hiring women

321
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,400
But luckily, my father is a prince

322
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,799
As long as I'm interested in solving cases

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,880
no one dares to stop me

324
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,119
Interested in solving cases

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,599
but even more interested in you

326
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,799
Since I promised the prince

327
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,799
to keep you by my side

328
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,760
I won't go back on my word

329
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,599
But if

330
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,919
you can't pass the assessment

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,640
then go straight back to the capital

332
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,080
No problem, Sir

333
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,239
Sir

334
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,960
This time you came to Luoyang County

335
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,200
what case are you here to handle?

336
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,880
This

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,479
is your first test from me

338
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,960
Sir, you want to test me.

339
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,799
What did you discover after entering the city?

340
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,799
But

341
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,080
I only found that the people hold you in great esteem.

342
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
Even the storybooks say

343
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
that once you faced an attack from ten people,

344
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,520
and with a single punch,

345
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:43,440
you struck with such force it was like hitting through a mountain.

346
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,520
Your opponents all fell to the ground.

347
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,239
The people even respectfully call you

348
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,640
the greatest detective in the land.

349
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,039
And what about Lord Geng Zhao?

350
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,400
Lord Geng.

351
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,239
You are Lord Geng Zhao.

352
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,799
That is me.

353
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,479
My dream is to be like you,

354
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,200
traveling the land and solving cases for the people.

355
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,080
Lord Geng.

356
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,080
You are traveling in disguise,

357
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,760
is it because of the Lu family case?

358
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,440
Is it the Lu family from the nursery rhyme?

359
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,200
Exactly.

360
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,439
This is a copy of my autopsy report.

361
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,160
Lu Jiu was wrongfully imprisoned.

362
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,479
The corrupt official covered up for the suspect.

363
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,040
Please, Lord Geng, seek justice.

364
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,239
Sir

365
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,319
You can't seriously believe

366
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,839
that little girl's words, right?

367
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
This case file is well-argued and supported by evidence.

368
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,199
The logic is clear.

369
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,920
Look at her,

370
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,040
then look at yourself.

371
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,079
How am I anything like her?

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm a legitimate temporary deputy of the Investigation Bureau.

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,680
Yes,

374
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,280
a temporary deputy who wears makeup and perfume.

375
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,880
Sir,

376
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
about the Lu family case,

377
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,560
I have some more thoughts.

378
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,560
Whether or not it's a wrongful conviction,

379
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
I think

380
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,239
Lu Jiu won't just sit and wait for death.

381
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,280
Maybe

382
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,479
he'll try to prove his innocence by escaping from prison.

383
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,760
What are you doing? Let's go!

384
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
Lu Jiu has escaped from prison!

385
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,599
What's going on?

386
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,959
Lu Jiu went crazy,

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,119
he injured several of our men.

388
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,280
Let's go, let's go!

389
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,800
It seems

390
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,319
all of this was planned by you.

391
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,920
The clothes and phosphorus powder were all within the budget.

392
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,199
But running with you on my back

393
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,119
should be extra.

394
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,359
Burning bridges after crossing the river

395
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,400
is how Young Master Lu Jiu operates.

396
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,079
I'm not the kind of person who burns bridges.

397
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,040
However,

398
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,319
you keep showing up around me again and again.

399
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,719
Even the jailbreak was part of your plan.

400
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,680
I have to be cautious.

401
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,359
Go ahead,

402
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,599
what are you really after?

403
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,680
Saving your life, Young Master Lu Jiu,

404
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,479
and taking half of the Lu family's fortune

405
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,479
isn't too much to ask, is it?

406
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,880
Then you'll probably be disappointed.

407
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
The Lu family business

408
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,880
has nothing to do with me.

409
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,719
Then let your father, Lu Kun, pay.

410
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
The last time I saw my father

411
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,280
was six or seven years ago.

412
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,479
He would never

413
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,239
pay such a high price for me.

414
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
That's not necessarily true.

415
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Now that your older brother is dead,

416
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,479
you're his only son.

417
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
Old Master Lu is a shrewd businessman.

418
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,439
Of course he knows how to weigh the pros and cons.

419
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,239
That's right.

420
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,880
Everyone in the world is after profit.

421
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,119
Everyone hustles for their own gain.

422
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,040
Alright.

423
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't know martial arts.

424
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:27,719
On this journey,

425
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,640
I'll need you.

426
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,400
Deal.

427
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,880
This umbrella is no ordinary umbrella.

428
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
Who are you, really?

429
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,239
Shut up.

430
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,040
Run!

431
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,119
Chase them!

432
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
Your umbrella.

433
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,199
It's over there.

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,839
Stop!

435
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,000
Let's go.

436
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,520
You owe me another favor.

437
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,079
Likewise.

438
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,640
Father

439
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,119
Let me stop your bleeding first.

440
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,640
It's no use.

441
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,920
Fortunately,

442
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,560
before I leave,

443
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,359
Father

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,959
I can

445
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,959
see

446
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,400
you one last time.

447
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,160
Father

448
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,079
The happiest thing in my life

449
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,800
is having you as my daughter.

450
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,239
Father

451
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,160
I used to often think,

452
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,599
if only you were really my daughter,

453
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,719
how wonderful that would be.

454
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,000
Father

455
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,160
I am your daughter.

456
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,599
At the very back of the cellar,

457
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,199
in the hidden compartment,

458
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,800
there are your birth parents'

459
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
letters

460
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,599
and keepsakes.

461
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,760
Take the keepsakes

462
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,400
and go to Mist Town.

463
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,359
Find your uncle.

464
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,040
I don't want to find my uncle.

465
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,119
I just want you by my side.

466
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,000
Remember,

467
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,199
Father

468
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,119
I always wanted to

469
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,160
stay by your side.

470
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,959
Father

471
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,599
Father

472
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,800
Father

473
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:15,479
Father, look at me.

474
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,959
Maybe the secret behind my elder brother's death

475
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,040
is hidden in this secret room.

476
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
So there really was something being kept from me.

477
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,119
And it's a big deal.

478
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,400
Fog Town.

479
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,400
Once we get to Fog Town,

480
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,439
maybe we can unravel

481
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,719
the secret you want to know.

482
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,160
It seems that even in disguise, it's hard to leave the city.

483
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,359
Go buy me a candied hawthorn stick.

484
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,359
At a time like this, you still—

485
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,280
My money only comes in, never goes out.

486
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,760
Before leaving,

487
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
I still need to meet someone.

488
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,560
Linlang

489
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,359
your father

490
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,800
why did he suddenly

491
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,959
That day, as soon as I entered,

492
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,640
I saw thieves lying all over the ground.

493
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,680
My father also

494
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,239
Last night, Sima Kong and I were attacked too.

495
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,160
Could it be

496
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,719
I investigated the traces of the fight.

497
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,319
It wasn't done by the same group.

498
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Who on earth did it?

499
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,640
As an officer of the yamen,

500
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,520
there are some things I shouldn't tell you.

501
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,599
But that corrupt official is colluding with the real culprit.

502
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,280
He has tried every way to stop me from overturning your case.

503
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,199
Now,

504
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,800
I've already been dismissed from the yamen.

505
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,839
After thinking it over,

506
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,479
I decided it's best to tell you.

507
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,359
I re-examined the body.

508
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,479
The body

509
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,239
isn't your elder brother at all.

510
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,800
The body is a fake.

511
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,160
My brother's whereabouts are unknown.

512
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,280
The authorities rushed to convict.

513
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,319
There must be a conspiracy behind this.

514
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,160
Now I'm the only witness.

515
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,160
It will be very difficult to overturn the case.

516
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,800
Wuzhen

517
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
The truth should be in Wuzhen.

518
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,560
Before my father died,

519
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,359
he told me to go to Wuzhen to find my uncle.

520
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,319
This is a keepsake left to me by my birth parents.

521
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,359
We're heading in the same direction.

522
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,520
It's just that

523
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,760
Sima Kong and I

524
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,199
are currently wanted.

525
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,359
Getting assigned to guard the city gate is unlucky enough.

526
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,439
I didn't expect to run into her too.

527
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,520
What bad luck.

528
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:35,959
Wait a moment.

529
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,560
The wheel tracks are so deep.

530
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
What's inside the coffin?

531
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,640
My father.

532
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,359
A few days ago,

533
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,880
quite a few people did break into the Xu residence.

534
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They killed Old Xu.

535
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,280
Judging by the date, it's time for the funeral.

536
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,359
That's really unlucky.

537
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,680
Hurry, let's go!

538
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,040
Sir,

539
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,719
the fake wanted notice posted at the city gate

540
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,520
I've already had it removed.

541
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,079
Lu Jiu and the others

542
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
have also left the city as you planned.

543
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,479
Our people

544
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,839
Should we keep pursuing them?

545
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
No need to pursue any further.

546
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,959
Just wait for good news.

547
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,719
Isn't this the case file

548
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,479
that the female coroner gave about the Lu family's murder?

549
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,959
Why are there two copies?

550
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,000
I knew you were cold on the outside but warm inside.

551
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,560
You're worried I'll get too tired.

552
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,359
Get out.

553
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,680
I am a dignified princess,

554
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,479
lowering myself to help you pack.

555
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,359
And you actually

556
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:09,920
Here with me,

557
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,959
there is no princess.

558
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,079
If you want to be a princess,

559
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,920
you can go back to the capital right now.

560
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,119
Father,

561
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:47,920
don't worry.

562
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,880
I will go to Mist Town to find Uncle, just as you wished.

563
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,959
If you want to eat anything down there,

564
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,800
or drink anything,

565
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,239
just let me know in a dream.

566
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
Don't worry about me.

567
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,560
Rest assured.

568
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
I will take good care of Linlang.

569
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,079
Shedding one's shell to escape, right.

570
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
The corpse at the Lu residence

571
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,959
is not Lumingcheng.

572
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,359
The Beggar Sect sent word

573
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,520
that someone paid a large sum

574
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,800
to have them deal with the corpse.

575
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,400
Even if Lumingcheng isn't dead,

576
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,959
his whereabouts are still unknown.

577
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,079
And the clues point directly to Mist Town.

578
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,319
So Lu Jiu

579
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,359
is our last card.

580
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,439
So as long as we have this card,

581
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,640
we still have hope

582
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,599
of finding clues to the Lu family treasure.

583
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,719
However,

584
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
the authorities already have leads on Lu Jiu.

585
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,920
There must be a spy close to him.

586
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,479
Xu Linlang.

587
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,839
Hmm.

588
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,839
Why is he taking so long just to wash his hands?

589
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,599
There were informants even inside the prison.

590
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,599
It's possible

591
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,479
he went to meet with that person.

592
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,040
That Sima Kong may have taken my money

593
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,880
to get into the prison and deliver your message,

594
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,400
but since he took such a big risk

595
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,400
to help you escape,

596
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,800
he probably has other motives.

597
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,920
Why are you looking at me?

598
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,800
So it was you after all.

599
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,520
You warned me someone might use poison.

600
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,520
Yes.

601
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,000
That day in the prison,

602
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,520
you drove me away without listening to a word I said.

603
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,319
How could I dare to warn you after that?

604
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,479
It was all my fault.

605
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,439
I shouldn't have... All right, all right.

606
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,479
If all the evidence pointed to you,

607
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,239
I wouldn't be so sure about you either.

608
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,920
Now we're even.

609
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,160
But...

610
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,760
We still have to watch out for Sima Kong.

611
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,520
Don't worry.

612
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
I know what I'm doing.

613
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,040
I don't know martial arts.

614
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,079
But he

615
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,800
has the skills to escape.

616
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,239
If we want to find out the truth,

617
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,400
we need him.

618
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,599
Lu Jiu,

619
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,040
I've noticed you're different from before.

620
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,079
Now,

621
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,599
my family is missing,

622
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,239
and I'm accused of murder.

623
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,319
I have already

624
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,959
ceased to be the person I once was.

625
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,199
We only discussed the price for escorting you before.

626
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,239
Investigation and tracking

627
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,439
will cost extra.

628
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,599
Why did you take so long?

629
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,280
I was just going to wash my hands,

630
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,959
but I thought I should get rid of bad luck.

631
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,079
So I changed my clothes.

632
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,599
Young Master Sima really lives up to his name.

633
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,959
Someone even brought you clothes.

634
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
You truly are extraordinary.

635
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,680
Same to you.

636
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,000
This way.

637
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:19,959
Wait.

638
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,119
This way.

639
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,920
Mist Town is in the southeast.

640
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,239
If we take the main road,

641
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,839
it’s not only a detour, but also dangerous.

642
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,199
The authorities probably think the same.

643
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,400
So we’ll do the opposite.

644
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,359
Even though it’s a bit of a detour,

645
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
we can avoid being pursued.

646
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,560
Just as I said.

647
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,199
You really aren’t an ordinary person.

648
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,520
I feel like

649
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,239
he’s hiding a lot from us.

650
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,640
Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.
