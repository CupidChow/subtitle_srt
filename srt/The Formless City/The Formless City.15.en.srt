1
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,279
Who said it was hard for me?

2
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Look.

3
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,800
Does it look like it?

4
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
No.

5
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
It's not just similar.

6
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,119
This is exactly it.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,399
This is even more refined than a noble lady.

8
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,360
Elegant and magnificent.

9
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,639
As beautiful as a fairy.

10
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,919
It's like a fairy descended to earth.

11
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,199
I think just relying on clothes isn't enough.

12
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,559
I still need to learn how to act like a noble lady.

13
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,600
I think

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,800
those young ladies on the stage

15
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
are all

16
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,720
like this.

17
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,520
Linlang,

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,559
don't make things hard for yourself.

19
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,639
Just be yourself, that's good enough.

20
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,080
What did you say?

21
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,839
Don't move.

22
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,440
That's the feeling.

23
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
What feeling? Pain?

24
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,119
Exactly like Miss Hua.

25
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,440
It looks like it.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,320
That's the spirit.

27
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,000
Miss Hua.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
This Miss Hua

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Although she was stunningly beautiful,

30
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,199
she was also exceptionally tough.

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,080
She once married the newly appointed top scholar.

32
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,279
Because of conflicts with her in-laws,

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,520
she forced her husband to write a divorce letter.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,240
She inherited the Hua family estate herself.

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,679
In a few years, she became the richest person in Shanxi.

36
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,119
So,

37
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,679
she could be considered a heroine among women.

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Isn't that just like you,

39
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,199
except you don't look the same?

40
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,240
That old Taoist has seen you all.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,279
Put this on.

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,440
Not just him,

43
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,639
even you yourselves

44
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,559
won't be able to recognize yourselves.

45
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,960
Human skin mask.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,199
Miss Hua comes from a merchant family.

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,520
How did she get involved with the underworld?

48
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,279
Miss Hua's godmother

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,399
is the head of the One Flower Five Leaves Hall in Jiangnan.

50
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,720
She has always had dealings with these human traffickers.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
And this Miss Hua

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,839
doesn't run her business as honestly as her father did.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
As long as it's profitable,

54
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,720
she dares to get involved.

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
So this time,

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,760
it's not an ordinary deal.

57
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,320
It's about drugged people.

58
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,239
Drugged people.

59
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,799
Master Taoist.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,519
Miss Hua sent word that she'll be here soon.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,839
Hmm.

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
This Miss Hua

63
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,000
is our major employer.

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,480
And yet someone sneaks in at this time.

65
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
We have to be on guard.

66
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,720
Pass down the order.

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,519
Everyone needs to keep their eyes wide open today.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,399
Go.

69
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes.

70
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,920
Master Taoist, Miss Hua has arrived.

71
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,079
Miss Hua is here.

72
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,519
Forgive me for not greeting you sooner.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,959
I'm not here to exchange pleasantries.

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
Where is what I want?

75
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,000
Please rest inside for a moment.

76
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll make the arrangements right away.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,799
Please.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Our rural area here

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,519
certainly doesn't have

80
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,399
tea that would catch Miss Hua's eye.

81
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,160
Am I here to drink tea?

82
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,959
This matter of the drugged person

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,559
is of great importance.

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,200
I still have something to ask Miss Hua.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,959
What is it?

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,040
Last time, thanks to Madam Liu's righteous help,

87
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,880
she used five moves of Black Sand Palm

88
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,000
to kill my enemy

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,640
and saved my life.

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,600
I wonder if Miss Hua at that time

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
happened to see it.

92
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:06,839
That would be an unforgettable memory.

93
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,959
It seems my godmother, Madam Liu,

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,040
since she retired from the martial world,

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,519
has been forgotten by everyone.

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,799
Her reputation in the martial world

97
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,359
is no longer worth much.

98
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,640
I should go back and advise her

99
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,320
not to show herself in public anymore

100
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,239
so she doesn't bring trouble upon herself.

101
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,519
This person's hands are clean and delicate.

102
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,320
How could they possibly be a slave?

103
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,559
Someone, come!

104
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,799
Miss Hua's godmother

105
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,799
is the head of the Wuye Hall in Jiangnan.

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,040
She has always had dealings with these human traffickers.

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,799
And this Miss Hua

108
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,600
does not run her business as honestly as her father did.

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,040
As long as it's a profitable business,

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
she dares to get involved.

111
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,359
So this time,

112
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,760
it's not an ordinary deal.

113
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,880
It's about drugged people.

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,359
Why are you helping me?

115
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,119
I'm not helping you.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,559
I'm helping myself.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,959
Tomorrow, pretend to be Miss Hua.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,640
The woman who is trading with you—

119
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,959
I want her to disappear from this world.

120
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,279
Miss, it's obvious you're well-trained.

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
For something as simple as killing,

122
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,119
do you really need someone else to do it?

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,959
Could it be that you,

124
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,239
are afraid of being seen?

125
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,359
My affairs

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,839
are none of your concern.

127
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,040
If you succeed in this matter,

128
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,920
Tianluo will not treat you unfairly.

129
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,799
Tianluo?

130
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,920
Thank you, Master.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,440
For helping me see this person's true nature.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
Fei Ying.

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
Fei Ying.

134
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,200
So,

135
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,799
Master, you have other guests here.

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,959
Miss Hua's Black Sand Palm

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,320
has truly inherited Madam Liu's skills.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,799
I am truly amazed.

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,320
But as for this young lady,

140
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,799
I do not know her.

141
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,359
I want you to make him pay with his life.

142
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,359
Stop!

143
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,119
Are you alright?

144
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,440
Fortunately, Miss Hua was wise enough

145
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,679
to know that someone

146
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,119
didn't want this deal to go through.

147
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:41,520
That's why she had me prepare in advance.

148
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,599
Could it be

149
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,919
that Master still doubts my identity?

150
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,520
Actually, who I am doesn't matter.

151
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,960
The business of drugged people is extremely profitable.

152
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,359
Everyone wants to get involved.

153
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,080
Not just you,

154
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,719
even King Tianluo

155
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,359
wants to monopolize this trade.

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
and keep it all to himself.

157
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,799
Why would Tianluo care about this?

158
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,119
Several years ago,

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Tianluo had already acquired a large number of drugged people.

160
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,679
to search for treasures for him.

161
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,719
These living dead

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
are naturally the best candidates to enter tombs.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,239
Treasure hunting in tombs?

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,159
Are you talking about seven years ago?

165
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Master.

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,400
This person knows nothing about the drugged people.

167
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,760
Yet he dares to pretend to be one of Tianluo's men.

168
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
I hope Master will think twice.

169
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,200
This young woman who calls herself Tianluo

170
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,359
Her identity is indeed suspicious

171
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
But Miss Hua's Black Sand Palm

172
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,599
can't be faked

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,239
Since that's the case

174
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,640
There's no point in keeping you here

175
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,159
Fei Ying

176
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,640
You actually fought me because of her

177
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,599
I told you

178
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,440
No one is allowed to touch her

179
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Today, I insist on touching her

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Lu Jiu

181
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,119
Lu Jiu

182
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,119
Lu Jiu

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
Lu Jiu

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,440
Geng Zhao from the Diancha Division led people in and broke through

185
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,320
The young lady acted on her own without permission

186
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,719
If you don't want Tianluo and the Diancha Division to clash directly

187
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Please withdraw immediately

188
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,679
Just the few of you

189
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,799
think you can catch me?

190
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,679
I’ll make all of you die with me.

191
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,400
Sir, are you alright?

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,559
If you want us to die with you, you have to die first.

193
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,559
You—

194
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,520
You—

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,799
What you said is true.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,919
My younger brother is already dead.

197
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,760
My condolences.

198
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,640
If he were still alive,

199
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,520
he would surely want you to live freely.

200
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
Take your household registration papers.

201
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,200
Leave this place.

202
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,760
Before you go,

203
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,840
I have one more thing to do.

204
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,239
Didn’t you say

205
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,359
you wanted me to help you?

206
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,799
Tomorrow, I’ll help you.

207
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,679
I’ll put on a good show.

208
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,760
Sister, I knew you would come to save me.

209
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,119
Go.

210
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,159
In a moment, take that road.

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
You’ll be able to get out.

212
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,359
What about you?

213
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,520
I still have things to do, you go first.

214
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,559
Where are you going?

215
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,960
Don’t you want me anymore?

216
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,520
It’s not that I don’t want you.

217
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,479
There are others here just like you.

218
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,119
I need to save them too.

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,799
Be good.

220
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,440
Don’t leave me behind.

221
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,640
No.

222
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,080
Be good.

223
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,239
Listen to me.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sister.

225
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,200
Sister.

226
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,760
Linlang

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,039
Young Master

228
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,359
You finally woke up.

229
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,280
Old Yan

230
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,440
That look on your face

231
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,320
really makes me lose face.

232
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,080
But you’ve finally regained consciousness.

233
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,359
I lost consciousness?

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,520
Why can’t I remember anything?

235
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,919
I can’t remember anything at all.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,799
But you still remember the person you want to see.

237
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,520
You were right about that.

238
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,520
I developed feelings I shouldn’t have.

239
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,520
This time, my foster father sent you to rescue me.

240
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,840
I’m afraid it’s my last chance.

241
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,559
No.

242
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,119
The ones who saved you this time

243
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,799
were Xu Linlang and Lu Jiu.

244
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,599
What?

245
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,679
Your identity has already been discovered by the Diancha Division.

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Even the news of your disappearance

247
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,799
was passed on by Geng Zhao

248
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,280
directly to the Sect Leader.

249
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,359
The Sect Leader did it for the sake of everyone in Tang Sect.

250
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,280
He had no other choice.

251
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,359
It’s understandable.

252
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,880
What about them?

253
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,919
Them?

254
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,559
Something happened to Linlang.

255
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,119
No, no, not her.

256
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,599
It’s Lu Jiu.

257
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,799
What happened to him?

258
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You're awake.

259
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,000
That's such a relief.

260
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,200
How is he doing now?

261
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,359
I've already treated his wounds.

262
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,599
But his condition

263
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,559
is not very good.

264
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,159
Who poisoned him so severely?

265
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,799
She was targeting me.

266
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,200
Lu Jiu did it all to save me.

267
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,559
In the end,

268
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,159
it's still because of me.

269
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,239
If it weren't for saving me,

270
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,919
he wouldn't be in this situation.

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
Don't say that.

272
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,400
Your medical skills are better than mine.

273
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
Please check on him quickly.

274
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,359
This poison is very tricky.

275
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,520
If we can't get the antidote from the person who poisoned him,

276
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,119
I'm afraid we can only use ginseng soup to keep him going.

277
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,880
And then try to find another solution.

278
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,200
I've already tried.

279
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,359
But I just can't get him to swallow it.

280
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,719
His pulse is very weak now.

281
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,640
If he doesn't get the ginseng soup soon,

282
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,880
I'm afraid he won't last much longer.

283
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,520
He drank it.

284
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,160
He’s dead.

285
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,839
He still has a breath left, but

286
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,239
I’m afraid

287
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,880
he only has a few days left.

288
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
All these years,

289
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,520
I’ve traveled far and wide.

290
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,239
I’ve also collected some secret medicines.

291
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,520
He’s just like me.

292
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,959
After all, we’re both your sons.

293
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,599
We can’t just stand by and watch.

294
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,560
Fool.

295
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:32,920
I don’t want him to die.

296
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,119
Because he hasn’t revealed the clue to the treasure yet.

297
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:35,959
But

298
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,560
if we offer the medicine now,

299
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,800
I’m afraid it will expose Father’s plan.

300
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,439
No rush.

301
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,439
This was caused by the daughter of that old Dugu.

302
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,920
For the sake of the Wuxiang treasure,

303
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,199
I’m sure he won’t just stand by and do nothing.

304
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,400
Father, you are wise.

305
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,119
This...

306
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,160
He’s already taken two of my pills.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
There’s no effect at all.

308
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
What a waste... Shut up!

309
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,280
His poison

310
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,800
not only hasn’t lessened,

311
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,199
it’s actually getting worse.

312
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,119
It’s as if it already knew

313
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
how I would try to counter it.

314
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,479
Then what should we do?

315
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,959
Only the one who tied the bell can untie it.

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,599
She probably hates me now.

317
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,199
Even if I want to see her,

318
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,119
she doesn’t want to see me.

319
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,119
Then I’ll prescribe him some medicine.

320
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,079
Linlang.

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,920
You’ve watched over him all day.

322
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,119
He hasn’t had a drop of water.

323
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,800
Go get some rest.

324
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,560
The rest

325
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,319
leave to me and Lao Yan.

326
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
As long as he doesn't wake up,

327
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,760
I won't leave.

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
But you...

329
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,239
It's all my fault.

330
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,160
If it weren't for me,

331
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,839
you wouldn't have acted impulsively.

332
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,520
If I were a bit stronger,

333
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,959
I could have cured your poison.

334
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,199
Lu Jiu,

335
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,400
please wake up.

336
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,839
Can you please wake up?

337
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,040
Who?

338
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,160
I know you're here.

339
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,560
I also know

340
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,359
Lu Jiu is the most important to you.

341
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,640
Otherwise, you wouldn't have risked yourself to save him.

342
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,000
Lu Jiu is deeply poisoned now.

343
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,760
Please, save him.

344
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,199
Otherwise, he'll die.

345
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,800
Please, save him.

346
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,560
What do you need to save him?

347
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,760
As long as you're willing to save him,

348
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm willing to leave him.

349
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,839
I'll never appear by his side again.

350
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,839
Do you think I would trade his life

351
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
for your departure?

352
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,199
What do you need to save him?

353
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,719
Just say it,

354
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,959
I'm willing to do anything.

355
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,119
Say something.

356
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,359
What will it take for you to save him?

357
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,760
Do you think I don't want to save him?

358
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,640
There's no cure for this poison.

359
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,079
I don't believe it.

360
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
How can there be a poison with no cure?

361
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,640
I don't believe it.

362
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,400
Please, save him.

363
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,920
At least you can still be by his side.

364
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,920
But I

365
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,199
don't even have that right.

366
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,199
Linlang

367
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,000
Why are you soaking wet?

368
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,560
I'll go boil some hot water for you.

369
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,359
No need.

370
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,000
I just want to be alone with Lu Jiu for a while.

371
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,520
I heard your poison can't be cured.

372
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,439
Surprised?

373
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,359
Unexpected?

374
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,160
They say you become red when close to cinnabar,

375
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,839
and black when close to ink.

376
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,000
After spending so much time with you,

377
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,280
I've become unruly myself.

378
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,000
Forget it.

379
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,479
Since you're poisoned,

380
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,599
I won't hold it against you.

381
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,640
Do you still remember

382
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,119
the last time

383
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,359
you thought you were poisoned?

384
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,439
Sima Kong's hawthorn pill

385
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,439
tricked you.

386
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,800
This time,

387
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,760
whose poison did you fall for?

388
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,160
Who fooled you now?

389
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,359
I owe you so much.

390
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,400
How should I repay you?

391
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,839
How about

392
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,880
I give myself to you?

393
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,239
Let me tell you a secret.

394
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,239
I've liked you for a long time.

395
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,280
So long that I don't even know

396
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,920
when it started.

397
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,520
Maybe

398
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,760
it was when you risked your life for mine with Jia Changyi.

399
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,359
You traded your life for mine.

400
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,119
Or maybe

401
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,160
when you rushed in to save me from Li Mu.

402
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,400
Or perhaps

403
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,359
it was the first time I saw you.

404
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,800
You were already in my heart.

405
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,239
Lu Jiu,

406
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,319
please wake up.

407
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,319
Wake up.

408
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I haven't heard your answer yet.

409
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,920
Please wake up.

410
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,239
Young Master

411
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,439
Where are you going?

412
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,239
Tang Sect

413
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,520
He was poisoned by the special toxin Master made for Tianluo years ago.

414
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,400
An incurable poison.

415
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,359
Master is a cautious person.

416
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,719
He must have left a backup plan.

417
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,959
This concerns the Tang Sect's loyalty to Tianluo.

418
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,280
Do you think the Sect Leader would, for the sake of

419
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,800
someone completely unrelated,

420
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,599
abandon the Tang Sect?

421
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,239
He is not unrelated.

422
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,199
He is my friend.

423
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,119
Just because he's your friend?

424
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,000
He is also the one my beloved cares for.

425
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,680
The person in her heart isn't you.

426
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,719
Why are you doing this?

427
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,239
I don't expect her to care for me.

428
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,439
Everything I do

429
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,640
is just to keep her from being sad.

430
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,119
Do you realize

431
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,880
there's no turning back from this?

432
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,479
If you have no companions,

433
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,800
even if the road ahead is smooth,

434
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,640
what does it matter?

435
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,239
Young Master

436
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,719
Young Master

437
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,520
I finally caught up with you.

438
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,719
You...

439
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,680
Master

440
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:08,599
Sect Leader

441
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,280
You still remember me as your master.

442
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,239
When Master heard I was kidnapped by villains,

443
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,239
he didn't send anyone to rescue me, did he?

444
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,199
How dare you!

445
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,800
The Tang Sect has always put personal interests last.

446
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,719
Master did nothing wrong.

447
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,439
I broke the rules.

448
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,280
I accept the punishment myself.

449
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:35,880
Young Master

450
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,839
At least you still remember the rules.

451
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,239
Come back with me.

452
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,079
You are still the young master of Tang Sect.

453
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,520
The position of young master means nothing to me.

454
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:59,880
I hope, for the sake of our years as master and disciple,

455
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,439
you will give me the antidote to the incurable poison.

456
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,439
If I give you the antidote now,

457
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,040
wouldn't that be telling Tianluo

458
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,880
that Tang Sect is disloyal?

459
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,640
Sima Kong.

460
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,040
I have painstakingly trained you all these years,

461
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,800
yet you care nothing for the fate of Tang Sect.

462
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,239
If Tianluo investigates,

463
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,599
I will take all the responsibility myself.

464
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,319
Can you really bear it?

465
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,800
I came to Mist Town this time

466
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,880
on the orders of Tianluo's leader,

467
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,719
Dugu.

468
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,439
I'm afraid

469
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,760
he already knows I have the antidote.

470
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,680
He's just waiting to see what I do.

471
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,439
Then it's simple.

472
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,719
As long as I'm not a disciple of Tang Sect,

473
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
I can resolve Tang Sect's crisis.

474
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,920
You—

475
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,599
What are you trying to do?

476
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,760
While the young master was kidnapped,

477
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,479
he was forced to take a mind-altering drug.

478
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,640
He still hasn't recovered.

479
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,199
No.

480
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,640
Every word I say

481
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,719
comes from the bottom of my heart.

482
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,079
Master, for over ten years you raised me with kindness.

483
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,439
I, Sima Kong, will never forget it.

484
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,160
Now, I return all the martial arts of Tang Sect

485
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,560
back to you.

486
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,520
From this moment on,

487
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,000
with Tang Sect,

488
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,119
I will have nothing more to do.

489
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,079
Don't!

490
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,439
Young Sect Leader!

491
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,160
You...

492
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,800
You...

493
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,000
You actually crippled your own martial arts for their sake?

494
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,640
The bond between us as master and disciple for over ten years

495
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,800
is it really not as strong as the few days you spent with them?

496
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,199
There's one more thing I forgot to report to you.

497
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,000
When I was imprisoned this time,

498
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,040
I saw, from my childhood,

499
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:30,199
the drugged puppets you used to train me.

500
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,520
Actually... actually, in your eyes,

501
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
I am no different from those walking corpses,

502
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:45,119
those drugged puppets you control.

503
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,719
There's really no difference, is there?

504
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,319
We're all just tools of the Tang Sect.

505
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,319
Since that's how you see it,

506
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:21,000
then I, your disciple, am of no more use to you.

507
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,239
From now on,

508
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,680
the relationship between us as master and disciple

509
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,920
is completely severed.

510
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:25,640
Sir

511
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,760
You can't do this.

512
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,719
Lu Jiu was helping our Diancha Division save people.

513
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,560
That's how he got injured.

514
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,079
We can't just stand by and watch him die.

515
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,719
But using your vital energy to keep Lu Jiu alive

516
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,680
is basically trading your life for his.

517
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,800
I don't want anything to happen to you.

518
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,920
It's not that serious.

519
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,280
It's just

520
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,760
using up some vital energy.

521
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,920
If it's only a small amount of energy,

522
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,199
then it's fine.

523
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,599
But judging by Lu Jiu's current injuries,

524
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,479
it will definitely drain almost all of your energy.

525
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,119
At that point,

526
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,839
you might not be able to save Lu Jiu,

527
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,880
and you might not survive yourself.

528
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,800
I don't want you to go.

529
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,040
As Geng Zhao,

530
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,359
I only act out of righteousness.

531
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,920
If you don't understand,

532
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,319
then from now on,

533
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,199
don't follow me anymore.

534
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,359
Sir
