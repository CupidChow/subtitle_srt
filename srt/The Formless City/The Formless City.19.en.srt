1
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,599
Let me tell you,

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
after you get married,

3
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,800
he'll definitely want you to be his supportive wife.

4
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,680
All those promises he made before

5
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,919
were just a momentary impulse.

6
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,559
They won't last long.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,639
Women are naturally just men's appendages.

8
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,160
Besides, your family works as coroners, which is an unconventional trade.

9
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,919
Dealing with corpses isn't considered a proper profession.

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
Women should stay at home,

11
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,679
serve their husbands, and be filial to their in-laws.

12
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,279
The world outside the home belongs to men.

13
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,559
I didn't know there were female coroners.

14
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,600
I never knew that before.

15
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,679
It's really not easy being a coroner.

16
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,639
Here in Gushan,

17
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,440
even though people don't steal and doors are left unlocked at night,

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,639
you have no cases to investigate.

19
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,520
But

20
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,919
you can help me manage Gushan.

21
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
This is your home too.

22
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,160
Linlang,

23
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,440
let me tell you,

24
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,520
men will never see

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,039
the sacrifices we make for them.

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,759
Women should live for themselves.

27
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
Right now, I only care about the academy.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm leaving now.

29
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,320
Don't go!

30
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,279
You...

31
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,479
What's wrong?

32
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,479
I'm fine.

33
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,279
I just feel a little unwell.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,440
I'm going out for some air.

35
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,880
Jiu'er,

36
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,919
the academy is completed today.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
As the dean, it's improper for you to leave your guests.

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
You're no longer

39
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,600
someone who acts alone.

40
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,559
You need to consider everyone in Gushan.

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,440
Go.

42
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,240
Go back.

43
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,520
From now on, the academy will rely on all of you.

44
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,320
Young Master Lu, let me offer you a toast.

45
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,720
Lord Geng.

46
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,760
What has happened?

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
The court has ordered a crackdown on Gushan.

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,839
The army is about to attack.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,519
Gushan has been peaceful for twenty years.

50
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,640
How did things suddenly turn out like this?

51
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,519
It's said that Tianluo is behind this.

52
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,480
They claim the remnants of Fengleitang are stirring up trouble again.

53
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,839
Fortunately, Lord Geng Zhao arrived in time.

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,760
He brought us the news.

55
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,040
The young chief has already led people to defend outside the stronghold.

56
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,679
Lu Jiu.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,559
Miss Xu.

58
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,760
You can't help with anything if you go now.

59
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,440
It would only distract the young chief.

60
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,519
He specifically asked me

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,359
to stay with you

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
to ensure your safety.

63
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,760
What about Sima Kong?

64
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,480
He is skilled with mechanical weapons.

65
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,200
He has gone with the young chief

66
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,079
to set up defenses against the enemy.

67
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,519
Why am I so useless?

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,959
I can't help with anything.

69
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,200
Although the people of Gushan are outlaws,

70
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,799
they have never let their guard down over the years.

71
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,920
They train regularly.

72
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,440
Even if we have to fight them head-on,

73
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,679
we still have some confidence.

74
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,959
I've already set up fortifications around Gushan.

75
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,920
We should be able to hold out for at least an hour.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
An hour.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,160
That's enough.

78
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,239
The court sent troops this time

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,200
because Dugu slandered us.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,559
He also tampered with the troop deployment.

81
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,559
Those who came

82
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,480
are all temporary recruits from the southwest barracks.

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,600
New recruits.

84
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,480
No matter who wins or loses,

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,119
Dugu wants to repeat what happened twenty years ago,

86
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,559
destroying Fengleitang

87
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,119
and reaping the benefits.

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,119
We absolutely cannot let him succeed.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,559
Time is running out.

90
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,679
Young Master Sima,

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,959
please come with me to check the defenses first.

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,359
Alright.

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,239
What about Bai Yu?

94
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Don't worry, Lord Geng.

95
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,640
The Gushan guards reported

96
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,519
that Miss Bai Yu

97
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,920
had already

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,959
left

99
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,799
the Gushan area

100
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,239
and headed toward the capital before the enemy arrived.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
That's good.

102
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,119
There's something I'm not sure if I should say.

103
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,320
Even if two people understand each other,

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,040
if they keep everything bottled up,

105
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,640
they can still drift apart.

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
Aren't you the same?

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Miss Xu

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,279
The young chief has given orders

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
The Xu residence is the safest place

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,079
He will defend it with his life

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,119
Miss Xu, you must not leave here

112
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,000
But I want to know how he is

113
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,040
Staying here is the best way you can help him

114
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,480
Come

115
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,640
This time, it was thanks to the young chief's brilliant strategy

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,320
that we were able to repel those soldiers

117
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Yes, that's right

118
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,799
The young chief is mighty

119
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,799
The young chief is mighty

120
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
The young chief is mighty

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,959
The young chief is mighty

122
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,720
The young chief is mighty

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,959
The young chief is mighty

124
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,640
This time

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,839
we also owe it to Lord Geng's military planning

126
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,959
and Young Master Sima's defense arrangements

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,600
that's how we managed to defeat the enemy so smoothly

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,399
Did we really win?

129
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,119
Today

130
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Gushan has won a great victory. Pass on my orders

131
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,519
Hold a grand banquet

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
Great!

133
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Lu Jiu

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,720
You have gone from pretending to be a wealthy young man

135
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,160
to becoming the respected young hero of Gushan

136
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,440
You have found your own path in life

137
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,519
Then I

138
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,119
should also go find mine

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,399
Take care

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,400
Uncle's letter

141
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,039
Longchi Cliff

142
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,239
is between Gushan and Wu Town

143
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,760
It's not far

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
Gushan's crisis has just ended

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,799
He must still have many things to take care of

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Xing'er

147
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,520
Have you seen Linlang?

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,280
She was just here a moment ago.

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Young Chieftain

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,479
You just won a great victory,

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,640
and now you...

152
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't know who it was just now,

153
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,359
but the way you looked at Sima Kong,

154
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,359
was so intense.

155
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,000
But you are the Young Chieftain.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
Of course you have to be more restrained than I am.

157
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,840
If you want me to restrain myself, that's fine.

158
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,840
You...

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,119
Help me find something.

160
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,000
Something?

161
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,599
Linlang.

162
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,200
Where are you going?

163
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,599
Linlang is gone.

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,239
How could that be?

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
Linlang has been feeling down lately.

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,239
It must be because you've been busy with Gushan affairs and neglected her.

167
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,960
If you paid more attention to her,

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,359
she wouldn't have disappeared for no reason.

169
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,440
Alright, that's enough.

170
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,960
This isn't the time to argue.

171
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,159
The most urgent thing now

172
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,919
is to find Miss Xu's whereabouts.

173
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,320
The footprints from the table to the door

174
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
judging by their size and depth,

175
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,719
match Miss Xu's build.

176
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,320
She must have entered the room not long ago,

177
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,719
saw this letter,

178
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:33,960
then suddenly turned around

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,679
and left the room.

180
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,239
What could be in that letter?

181
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
The content isn't important.

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,200
The person who left the message

183
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,400
entered the room through this window.

184
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,359
He was very careful.

185
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,280
Before leaving,

186
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
he erased any traces he left behind.

187
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,159
But precisely

188
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,000
the traces that were different from elsewhere

189
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,239
revealed his movements.

190
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,719
The scent of kaolin.

191
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,919
Kaolin is only found at Phoenix Mountain.

192
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,559
Linlang must have gone there.

193
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,760
Phoenix Mountain.

194
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,440
It's guarded by the sentries of Lone Mountain.

195
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,239
Once caught, it's hard to escape.

196
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,039
They would never walk into a trap.

197
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,239
You mean

198
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,239
Longchi Cliff.

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,520
I've seen the defense map of Lone Mountain.

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,239
There,

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
is only a few miles from Phoenix Mountain.

202
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,919
It's located in Mist Town.

203
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Between it and Lone Mountain,

204
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,039
the terrain is treacherous, easy to defend and hard to attack.

205
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,799
There's also a shortcut

206
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
that allows for a secret escape.

207
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,520
That person took Linlang there.

208
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,559
Could it be

209
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,039
No wonder you were once with the authorities.

210
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,440
You're very punctual.

211
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,599
Uncle.

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,520
Your father and I were both former members of Fenglei Hall.

213
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,159
You can call me uncle.

214
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,479
That would be appropriate.

215
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,719
My father was a member of Fenglei Hall.

216
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,280
It seems that for the past twenty years,

217
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,039
your father truly kept silent.

218
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,400
He even hid it from his own daughter.

219
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,799
If he hadn't killed Tianluo,

220
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
the assassin hunting down the remnants of Fenglei Hall,

221
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,559
no one in this world would know his true identity.

222
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,880
You even know about this.

223
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Who are you, really?

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,559
Miss, don't be afraid.

225
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,599
Since you've saved my son Lu Jiu many times,

226
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,440
I won't harm you.

227
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,280
Your son?

228
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,479
You are Lu Kun.

229
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,960
Tang Sect's hidden weapons.

230
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,760
I know you want to use me to threaten Lu Jiu.

231
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,799
Dream on.

232
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,559
Father.

233
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,000
You haven't wanted to see me for years.

234
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,599
I never expected

235
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,599
we would meet like this.

236
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,919
You still remember I'm your father.

237
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,919
I thought after you reunited with your mother,

238
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,919
you would cut all ties with me.

239
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,799
Even though you've done many wrongs,

240
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,520
the years you raised me,

241
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,440
I, Lu Jiu, dare not forget.

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,119
But you've forgotten the most important thing.

243
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,599
Lu Jiu.

244
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I had no other choice, my son.

245
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,719
I placed you by Tianluo's side

246
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,919
at least so you could stay alive.

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,159
Otherwise, both of us would have died long ago.

248
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,200
All my efforts and intentions

249
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,559
do you understand them?

250
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,359
Now,

251
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,760
you've already found the whereabouts of the treasure.

252
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,359
We can now

253
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,119
break free from Tianluo's control.

254
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,960
You and I can share the treasure together.

255
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I can even give you a warm home.

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,640
Come.

257
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,039
You are my father.

258
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Why

259
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:42,719
when faced with wealth that rivals a nation,

260
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,599
does our so-called family bond mean nothing?

261
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,760
This is the first lesson I teach you.

262
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,760
It might also be the last.

263
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,159
Give me the treasure map.

264
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,799
How pathetic.

265
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,080
How laughable.

266
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,840
You could have had both the treasure and family.

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,880
No.

268
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,599
Tell me

269
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,559
the clue to the treasure you found seven years ago—

270
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,679
what exactly was it?

271
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,719
Seven years ago

272
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,559
You killed me once

273
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,719
Seven years later

274
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,159
For the same purpose

275
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,599
You drove me to a dead end

276
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,159
Do you know

277
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,960
Every single day

278
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,159
I imagined how we would meet again

279
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,919
I never expected

280
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,239
It would be like this

281
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,520
Ungrateful wretch

282
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,320
You fell off a cliff

283
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,520
Though you barely survived

284
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,679
You lost your memory and wandered the streets

285
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,719
I took you in and raised you

286
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,159
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here today

287
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,440
Father

288
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,520
If you didn’t want the secret of the Wuxiang treasure

289
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I’m afraid when you met me on the street

290
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,919
You would have killed me right then

291
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
Why bring up the past

292
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,599
Better to think about the present

293
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,919
We, father and son, could share the treasure and rule the world

294
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,119
How joyful that would be

295
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,799
Give me the treasure

296
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,119
We could go back to how things were

297
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,479
Yes

298
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
Just like before

299
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
You kept me

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,440
No, imprisoned me

301
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,320
You imprisoned me in Luoyang County

302
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,640
Waiting for the day you could use me

303
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,960
Lu Kun

304
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,800
Today

305
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,640
The two of us

306
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
Let’s end our father-son relationship here

307
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,839
Sure.

308
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,599
Then let me see what you've got.

309
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
Show me what you're capable of.

310
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,839
Are you scared?

311
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm not scared.

312
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,520
When I'm with you,

313
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,560
even if the sky falls, I'm not afraid.

314
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,319
Do you still remember

315
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,319
seven years ago,

316
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
how I got my revenge on you?

317
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,719
No, don't.

318
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,319
Linlang, you're awake.

319
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,680
How did I get back?

320
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,959
Lu Jiu brought you back.

321
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,599
Where is he?

322
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,160
He...

323
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,959
How is he?

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Why does this child always make people worry?

325
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,239
Did Lu Jiu really do it for me?

326
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,520
Did something bad happen to him?

327
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,079
Stop talking.

328
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,199
Stop talking.

329
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,959
Lu Jiu is such a fool.

330
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,319
Is that how you talk about your savior?

331
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,599
You're not dead?

332
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,479
Who said I was dead?

333
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,959
I just hadn't finished speaking earlier.

334
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,640
What exactly happened?

335
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,560
I remember

336
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,359
the two of us fell off the cliff together.

337
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,920
After that, I passed out.

338
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,560
And then,

339
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,760
you fell into the trap I had set up in advance.

340
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Lu Jiu and I are clever,

341
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,839
how could we go to save someone without being prepared?

342
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,719
No wonder you jumped down without hesitation.

343
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
But

344
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,239
how did Chief Xu end up like this?

345
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
I just got a minor injury.

346
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,000
Mother was especially worried.

347
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,920
So she had someone bandage me up like this.

348
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,640
You should understand the chief.

349
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,640
As a mother,

350
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,439
she can't bear to see her son hurt at all.

351
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,920
Mother, don't worry.

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's all bandaged up.

353
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,719
See, I'm fine.

354
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,599
How can you say you're fine?

355
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,920
According to Gushan custom, you shouldn't get married if you're injured.

356
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,800
So your wedding with Linlang

357
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,280
will have to be postponed again.

358
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,119
When will I finally get to hold my grandson?

359
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,119
Linlang and I won't be getting married for now.

360
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Linlang and I won't be getting married for now.

361
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,000
It's so spicy, it's killing me!

362
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,800
Why does this wine taste so bad?

363
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,239
Wine.

364
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,800
It's not about the taste of the drink.

365
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,800
Then what are you drinking for?

366
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,640
It's the sorrow in the wine.

367
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,000
The heartbreak of those parted.

368
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,239
They say one drunken night can ease a thousand worries.

369
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,280
What troubles you, sir?

370
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,439
I'm returning to the capital.

371
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,599
To find Bai Yu.

372
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,599
It has nothing to do with her.

373
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,520
I was ordered to eliminate Gushan.

374
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,160
But I switched sides at the last moment.

375
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,280
I must go back.

376
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,520
To give an explanation.

377
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,319
Now the court is in chaos because of Wuxiang City.

378
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,680
It's all a mess.

379
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,920
This time, you saved the people of Gushan—

380
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,280
I saved the people of Gushan

381
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
out of righteousness.

382
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,760
Returning to the capital to report and accept punishment

383
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
is out of loyalty.

384
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,239
These are the principles I, Geng Zhao, pursue.

385
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,239
What must be faced

386
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,319
will have to be faced eventually.

387
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Master Geng, your integrity is admirable.

388
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,959
Linlang is impressed.

389
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,359
In the past, I saw you as my goal.

390
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,520
From now on, you are even more my role model.

391
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,400
Since you've given me such praise,

392
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,719
I have to live up to it.

393
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,000
There's something

394
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,439
I must give you.

395
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,839
Here.

396
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,119
This is the selection approval document for the Diancha Department.

397
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,520
I can take the Diancha Department exam now.

398
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,439
The Diancha Department is recruiting.

399
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,560
Although there are no gender restrictions,

400
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,280
over the past few decades,

401
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,199
very few women have been selected.

402
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,479
Even if they are selected,

403
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,040
most are royal relatives or nobles.

404
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,160
They do it just for fun.

405
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,479
The Diancha Department has always had strict requirements for hiring women.

406
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,239
But fortunately, my father is a prince.

407
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,599
As long as I'm interested in handling cases,

408
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,839
no one dares to stop me.

409
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,359
Interested in handling cases,

410
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,760
but I'm even more interested in you.

411
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,599
Sir,

412
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,640
don't think this is a life-saving charm.

413
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,000
You still have to pass the exam

414
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,719
to truly enter the Diancha Department.

415
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,000
Linlang understands.

416
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
But do you understand, sir?

417
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,760
Understand what?

418
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,239
You know what I'm talking about.

419
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,959
For people who share the same feelings,

420
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,280
if they keep everything in their hearts,

421
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,800
they will only grow further apart.

422
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,959
What a coincidence.

423
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,359
Someone else said the same thing.

424
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,959
Who was it?

425
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,560
Someone who asked me to help you get

426
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,479
the Diancha Department selection qualification.

427
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,719
I hope you will grant this request.

428
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,479
Miss Xu's skills in autopsy and investigation

429
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,760
have long met the standards of the Diancha Department.

430
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,239
I have often wanted to recruit her under my command.

431
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,359
But regarding this matter,

432
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,959
why didn't Miss Xu come to me herself?

433
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,599
His Majesty governs the country

434
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,000
with an emphasis on checks and balances.

435
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,719
The Tianluo mercenaries maintain their own authority,

436
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,560
so there is an intention to support the Diancha Department.

437
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
Furthermore, it is stipulated

438
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,560
that among the three Tianluo clans,

439
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,000
no death warrior may enter the Diancha Department.

440
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,719
Although you now go by the name Lu Jiu,

441
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,839
on your official records,

442
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,680
you are still registered as Fei Ying, a Tianluo death warrior.

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Are you worried that your relationship with her

444
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,319
will affect her career?

445
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,800
No.

446
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,520
For the Diancha Department,

447
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
to Linlang,

448
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,319
it is not about rank or official position,

449
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,599
but about her dream.

450
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,119
I want to help her fulfill her dream.

451
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,160
Miss Xu is determined to pursue justice in criminal cases,

452
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,959
upholding a heart of fairness.

453
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,640
Now you ask me

454
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,959
to make an exception and secure her selection.

455
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,239
Wouldn't that tarnish her aspirations?

456
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,319
The Diancha Department

457
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,680
can treat Linlang fairly.

458
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,719
With Linlang's abilities,

459
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,079
I believe she can enter

460
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,119
the Diancha Department honorably.

461
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,719
As for me,

462
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,119
I am willing to remain unmarried for life

463
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,239
to help her achieve her wish.

464
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,079
Why are you here?

465
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,959
You—

466
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:53,239
Is it because of what happened with my mother and me today—

467
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,000
Idiot.

468
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,959
Who said you could make decisions on your own?

469
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,880
Lord Geng,

470
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,439
you usually seem so quiet and reserved,

471
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,760
but you can't even keep something like this a secret.

472
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,359
I just want to ask you one thing right now.

473
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,319
Do you want to marry me?

474
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,959
Of course I do.

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Then let's get married in the spring.

476
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,920
Ah—

477
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,119
Even though my father has passed away,

478
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:37,119
the betrothal gifts, the engagement, the formal proposal—

479
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,079
the name inquiry, the setting of the date—

480
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,359
not a single step can be skipped.

481
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
I don't want my father to come to me in a dream and ask

482
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
how I could get married so casually.

483
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,160
But—

484
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,760
Haven't you always wanted to join the Diancha Office?

485
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,800
The Diancha Office was my dream in the past.

486
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,959
But you

487
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,599
are my dream now and in the future.

488
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,959
There's one more thing.

489
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,560
From now on, you're not allowed to hide anything from me.

490
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,680
Okay.

491
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,599
And one more thing—

492
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,000
This

493
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,119
This is

494
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,640
When I first came to Gushan

495
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,119
I saw how you felt about that set of dissection tools

496
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,400
You were unwilling to accept it

497
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,160
After thinking it over

498
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,479
I made a set for you myself

499
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,920
You made this yourself?

500
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,839
Yes

501
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,359
I’ve never done this kind of handiwork before

502
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,199
So I worked rather slowly

503
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,560
But

504
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,959
Isn’t this just like how you investigate cases

505
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,640
Slowly searching for the truth

506
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,040
You’re always like this

507
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,199
Quietly doing so much for me

508
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,160
But I

509
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,439
Can’t do anything for you

510
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640
I don’t need you to do anything for me

511
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,319
I just hope

512
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,319
You’ll always be happy

513
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,359
The left side is one inch higher.

514
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,239
That's not right.

515
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,680
You're two inches higher.

516
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,160
Young Master Sima,

517
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,640
can you not be so particular?

518
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,520
No, I can't.

519
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,560
Linlang's wedding

520
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,000
needs to be taken even more seriously than usual.

521
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,920
The right side is half an inch lower.

522
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:26,640
That's too much.

523
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,800
Raise it a bit.

524
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,319
That's right.

525
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,599
It seems giving you this task

526
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,880
was the right choice.

527
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,680
If you had stuck to the original plan and married in spring,

528
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,959
I could have prepared even better.

529
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,119
But you suddenly decided to get married before the New Year.

530
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,760
Now I'm caught off guard.

531
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,239
Linlang and I

532
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,959
have finally made it to this day.

533
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
If we don't get married for one more day,

534
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,800
I'll be uneasy for another day.

535
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,000
Sorry to trouble you, Young Master Sima.

536
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,520
Please bear with me.

537
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,719
Don't try to get close to me.

538
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,560
Even brothers settle accounts clearly.

539
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,359
Payment.

540
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
I'll just

541
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,520
give you a discount.

542
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,959
But

543
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,439
if you add up all the expenses,

544
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,800
about Miss Xing'er,

545
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,560
that was just an act for Linlang, wasn't it?

546
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,800
The day Linlang disappeared

547
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,400
Your reaction

548
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,640
can't fool anyone

549
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
You won't tell Linlang, right?

550
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,760
Why would I tell her?

551
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,880
But as your brother

552
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I hope you

553
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,839
can share what's on your mind

554
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,839
and have a good talk with Linlang

555
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,640
Don't make that face

556
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,640
Otherwise, after I get married, if you cause trouble again

557
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,199
I won't hold back from beating you up then

558
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,760
That's because you know Linlang

559
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,880
will eventually choose whom

560
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,599
that's all

561
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,199
Actually, our goals are the same

562
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,160
As long as Linlang is happy

563
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,520
I hope you won't let her down

564
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:51,199
And don't let down the compromise I've made for you

565
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,199
Mm

566
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,359
The wedding date is approaching quickly.

567
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,800
I thought we'd have to rush the tailor to make alterations.

568
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,880
But now it seems to fit perfectly.

569
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,160
No further changes are needed.

570
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,439
This wedding dress is truly beautiful.

571
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,760
It's my first time seeing one.

572
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,040
Miss Xu, before this,

573
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,199
have you never seen anyone else get married?

574
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,280
We're coroners.

575
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,040
Others think we're unlucky.

576
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,280
Whenever there's a happy occasion,

577
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,079
they drive us far away.

578
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,199
I'm sure you've heard some gossip too, Miss Xu.

579
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
They say you only want to work at the Investigation Bureau.

580
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,079
That you don't want to be a wife and mother.

581
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
And that you're not worthy of the young master.

582
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,640
But seeing you in this wedding dress now,

583
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,119
makes me think it's the young master who's not worthy of you.

584
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,079
You're really straightforward.

585
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Aren't you afraid I'll be upset by what you say?

586
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Why?

587
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,040
Would you rather I lied to make you happy?

588
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,520
You and Sima Kong really are

589
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,599
cut from the same cloth.

590
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
Miss Xu,

591
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
before the wedding,

592
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
let me teach you some etiquette.

593
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,160
For example,

594
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,719
the last two steps you took were a bit too big.

595
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,119
The proper way to walk should be like this.

596
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,479
Keep your shoulders level and steady.

597
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,520
Your toes and heels should always be in a straight line.

598
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,800
Just like this.

599
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
See?

600
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,359
How is it?

601
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm used to being casual.

602
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,760
I've never paid attention to these manners.

603
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,959
Miss Xu,

604
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,839
Although the people of Gushan are from the martial world,

605
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,439
Master Xu comes from a scholarly family.

606
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
She is quite particular about these etiquettes.

607
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
She has already sent someone to invite your uncle to attend the ceremony.

608
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,479
She must value this very much.

609
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,760
You need to practice more.

610
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,680
Master Xu,

611
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,479
Will she not like me?

612
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,560
No, she won't. Don't worry.

613
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,760
Master Xu,

614
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,599
Who wouldn't like such a beautiful daughter-in-law?

615
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,520
These earrings,

616
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,160
were given to me when I first joined Fenglei Hall.

617
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,199
They were a welcome gift from the Hall Master's wife.

618
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,959
I thought, since you'll continue working as a coroner,

619
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,880
things like jade bracelets or rings

620
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,680
would get in the way of your work.

621
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
But these suit you perfectly.

622
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,160
Such a precious gift...

623
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,719
In the first half of my life, I met the wrong people.

624
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,599
Now, seeing my son marry the one he loves,

625
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,160
I truly feel happy for you both from the bottom of my heart.

626
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,199
Thank you, Chief Xu.

627
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,040
These earrings have a peony design.

628
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,439
Peonies symbolize a match made in heaven.

629
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,119
They are both a flower and a medicine.

630
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,160
Giving them to you now

631
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,920
couldn't be more fitting.

632
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,520
What a coincidence,

633
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,439
my mother also left me a hairpin

634
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,079
with the same peony design.

635
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Linlang.

636
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
Stop calling, stop calling.

637
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,359
It's bad luck for the bride and groom to meet before the wedding.

638
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,520
You two really can't wait, can you?

639
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,680
Chief Xu.

640
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,680
Young Chief.

641
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
Chief Xu's orders.

642
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,839
You can't see each other before the wedding.

643
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,199
Forgive me.

644
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Excuse me, Young Chief.

645
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,800
Why are you pulling me?

646
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,719
Me?

647
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,239
I'll let you call me Chief Xu for two more days.

648
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
After that, you'll have to change what you call me.
