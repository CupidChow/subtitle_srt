1
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,600
This Xu Linlang

2
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,199
brought Young Master Lu Jiu to the court.

3
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,759
It's awkward for me to interrogate him.

4
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,679
But not interrogating him is also awkward.

5
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,399
Sir, please don't worry.

6
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,320
There are so many eyes watching in this pleasure boat.

7
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,759
If we release him directly,

8
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,160
it will only arouse suspicion.

9
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,199
But if

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
we settle things in the courtroom,

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
and resolve the matter,

12
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,520
that will truly show your skill.

13
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,479
When that happens,

14
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,720
the Lu family will surely thank you generously.

15
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,559
You really think things through.

16
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,279
No, no, no.

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,119
Sir, you are wise. Sir, you are wise.

18
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,320
Let's go.

19
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,279
Let's go.

20
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,320
Court is now in session.

21
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:04,000
All rise.

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
I, the magistrate, am presiding.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
If you have grievances, speak quickly.

24
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,800
Reporting to Your Excellency,

25
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,199
Miss Ling'er

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,039
asked me to make ginseng soup for her.

27
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,720
Everyone in the pleasure boat knows this.

28
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
Every time Lu Jiu comes,

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,679
he only looks for Miss Ling'er.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,119
That ginseng root

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
was given by Lu Jiu.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,119
There is a secret relationship here.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
Reporting to Your Excellency,

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,160
when I brought the ginseng soup to Miss Ling'er,

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,119
the two of them seemed to argue about something.

36
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,039
Thank you, Young Master Lu.

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,520
For the rest of my life,

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,559
I will serve you well.

39
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,800
That won't be necessary.

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,880
Your life

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,399
has always belonged to you.

42
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,080
Take your deed of servitude.

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
Young Master

44
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,880
He is clearly lying.

45
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,800
Ling'er

46
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
My Ling'er

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,880
Silence in the court! Silence!

48
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,759
Kneel!

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
Sir

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,519
If you allow me to perform an autopsy

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
I will definitely be able to identify the murderer

52
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,839
Autopsy

53
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,799
That needs to be reported to the authorities

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,239
Examine

55
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,440
It must be examined

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
If something is found during the examination

57
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,440
I, as the official

58
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,160
It will be difficult for me to handle

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
If something really is found

60
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,320
You’ll still be able to handle it then

61
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,359
Wouldn’t that show your talent?

62
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,640
At that time

63
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,839
I

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,320
will reward you handsomely

65
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,559
However

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,839
I have one condition

67
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,880
If

68
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,279
it proves my innocence

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,559
She

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,279
Xu Linlang

71
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,559
must apologize to me in public

72
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,200
Expression of pain

73
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,239
No external injuries

74
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,559
No foreign object in the mouth

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,200
Miss Ling’er

76
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,519
Pardon my rudeness

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,239
Sir

78
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,200
When can I go back?

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,160
Everyone on this pleasure boat

80
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,399
can't do without me.

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,119
Be quiet.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,880
To prevent collusion,

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,720
the three of you shouldn't be together.

84
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm being considerate since you're a woman.

85
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,320
That's why I allowed you to be here in the main hall.

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
As for the other two,

87
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,200
they don't have it as easy as you.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Why are you so nervous?

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,079
You haven't committed a crime.

90
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,799
These torture devices

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,720
won't be used on you.

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,239
Exactly.

93
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,559
Coward.

94
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,200
You two,

95
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,279
this is a coffin the yamen just ordered.

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,000
They say it's for the murderer in the pleasure boat case,

97
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,640
who will be executed on the spot.

98
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,079
Which one of you will sign for it?

99
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,760
Just as I thought.

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Looks like we've made some progress.

101
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
My act wasn't in vain.

102
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,640
Madam.

103
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,679
Let's go.

104
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,880
Where are we going?

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
Of course, to the prison.

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,160
Your two accomplices have confessed.

107
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,399
They said you committed the crime.

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
They're lying!

109
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,760
They were the ones who did it!

110
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:21,839
Sir

111
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,640
These two

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,399
One is the ginseng soup residue found in Miss Ling'er's stomach.

113
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,399
The other

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
was found in the back yard of the pleasure boat.

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
The two are exactly the same.

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,880
The ginseng soup is poisoned.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,679
That's not true.

118
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,600
Ginseng soup is such a precious thing.

119
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,679
If it wasn't poisoned, why was it thrown away?

120
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Obviously, the cook is hiding something.

121
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,040
If he poisoned it directly,

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
it would be too easy to get caught.

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,359
So,

124
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,279
he must have an accomplice.

125
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,279
Miss Ling'er has lived on the pleasure boat for many years.

126
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,519
She relies entirely on the staff to pass messages and buy things.

127
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,079
Recently,

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,559
she has often felt headaches.

129
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,160
So she asked someone to go out and buy medicine.

130
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,559
Just today,

131
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,359
she suddenly got the medicine.

132
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,880
There is poison in the medicine.

133
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,239
Both the hellebore and musk are very appropriate for the symptoms.

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,559
And they are not poisonous.

135
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,839
But if hellebore and ginseng are taken together,

136
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,119
they will produce a deadly poison.

137
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,880
Then,

138
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,880
it was all done in collusion by this servant and the cook.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,519
At most, I am guilty of knowing and not reporting it.

140
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,799
Is that right, sir?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,279
Although you did not kill anyone yourself,

142
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,920
you are still the mastermind behind it.

143
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,559
Both of them have confessed.

144
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,799
Not only did you take Ling'er’s redemption money,

145
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,320
you also wanted to take the private savings she had accumulated over the years.

146
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,320
So,

147
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,359
you ordered them to commit the crime.

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,960
These two ungrateful wretches,

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,479
I should have dealt with them myself at the time.

150
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,479
Then there wouldn’t have been so much trouble.

151
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,000
You have run this pleasure boat for many years,

152
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,080
and made so much money.

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Why would you even take money from such a miserable woman?

154
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,000
Why must you seize it?

155
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,239
A miserable woman?

156
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,960
Am I not also a miserable woman?

157
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,719
All I have ever wished for in my life

158
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,880
is to spend my life with the one I love.

159
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,440
As for this matter,

160
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,960
it was indeed I alone who ordered others to do it.

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,719
I

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,919
am willing to accept punishment.

163
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,280
The truth is revealed.

164
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,359
Take her away.

165
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
Young Master Lu Jiu is innocent.

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,559
Release him immediately.

168
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
Young Master,

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,719
you are free to go.

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,479
Fellow villagers,

171
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,440
Elders,

172
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,359
I am Xu Linlang, the coroner from the yamen.

173
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,280
Yesterday, I wrongly accused Young Master Lu Jiu.

174
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,320
I now sincerely apologize to him.

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,799
Please accept my apology.

176
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,599
Please accept my apology. Are you done yet?

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
Of course I'm not done.

178
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,479
You haven't said you forgive me yet.

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,520
Don't rich people care most about formalities?

180
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,760
I'll kneel and apologize to you.

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,119
Isn't it enough that I accept your apology?

182
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,359
Alright, that's enough. Everyone, disperse.

183
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,239
Disperse, disperse.

184
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
A girl

185
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
chasing a boy like this in the street,

186
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,119
aren't you afraid it will harm your reputation?

187
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Nothing is more important than solving the case.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,880
Gender doesn't matter in the face of the truth.

189
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,280
Just now in the courtroom,

190
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,400
you clearly, like me,

191
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,000
noticed something was wrong with the qin master.

192
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,919
That's why you helped me.

193
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,080
I was just

194
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,559
proving my own innocence.

195
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,679
I see.

196
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,239
You're just like

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,559
Tang Xuanzong Li Chen in the storybooks,

198
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,919
pretending to be crazy and foolish,

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
waiting for those who want to harm you to let their guard down,

200
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,080
and then making your move.

201
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,400
I never intended to betray anyone.

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,440
So my guess was right.

203
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,039
I'm warning you,

204
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,239
about this matter,

205
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,039
do not tell anyone.

206
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,719
I almost forgot.

207
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,119
You spent the whole day at the yamen.

208
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,960
You must be hungry.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,119
Let me invite you to my place for a meal.

210
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
To apologize to you.

211
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,799
Your place? Hmm.

212
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,960
Why are there bedding in this coffin?

213
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,559
That's my bed.

214
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,280
Alright, stop spacing out.

215
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,119
Hurry and eat.

216
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,039
Have a seat.

217
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,599
Don't just stand there.

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Sit down quickly.

219
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,599
I see over there

220
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
there are spices.

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,719
Could it be

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,400
you know how to make incense?

223
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,679
My family are spice merchants.

224
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,200
You really are an expert.

225
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
Those all belong to my father.

226
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,840
In our coroner's profession,

227
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,359
we deal with corpses all day.

228
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,919
My father has to make me some incense balls

229
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,320
to get rid of the smell of corpses on me.

230
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,000
Father.

231
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
You still call me father?

232
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,400
You were out all night and didn’t come home.

233
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,919
And now you bring a man home.

234
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,359
What kind of behavior is that?

235
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,119
Father,

236
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
let me introduce you.

237
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,200
This is Lu Jiu.

238
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,840
Yesterday, I almost wronged him.

239
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,799
So I brought him home for a meal

240
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
as an apology.

241
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Lu Jiu?

242
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,960
Isn’t he the famous

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,599
playboy?

244
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,320
He’s not a playboy.

245
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,320
He’s a good person.

246
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Would a good person ignore your reputation

247
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,719
and come to our house for breakfast?

248
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,280
I was being presumptuous as a junior.

249
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,479
Father,

250
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,679
he’s already here.

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,119
Please don’t say so much.

252
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,159
Come,

253
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,080
have a seat.

254
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,239
Lu Jiu, don’t be shy.

255
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,080
Let’s eat.

256
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:53,760
Oh, right.

257
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,640
Go to the ice cellar and bring over that plate of chicken feet.

258
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
It was placed there a few days ago.

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,679
The East Village brawl.

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,159
Next to the finger we took as evidence.

261
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,119
Hurry up.        Okay.

262
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,520
Young Master Lu.

263
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,960
You have no idea.

264
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,880
In our ice cellar,

265
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,440
there are human fingernails,

266
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,239
kneecaps, skullcaps,

267
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,960
and even intestines, liver, or lungs.

268
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,280
Those are all Linlang's trophies from solving cases.

269
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,760
Here, eat.

270
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,799
Where is she?

271
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,119
I originally wanted to treat you to a meal.

272
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,080
I didn't expect you'd lose your appetite.

273
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,000
Candied hawthorn.

274
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,239
There's a stall selling candied hawthorn over there.

275
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,440
Candied hawthorn works best.

276
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,119
Wait here.

277
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll go buy it for you right now.

278
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,679
How much for the candied hawthorn?

279
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,919
One wen.

280
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,880
Isn't this the impartial

281
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,880
and fearless coroner Xu?

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,559
What's this about?

283
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,039
You criticized me before.

284
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,559
Now you're ready to be Young Master Lu's concubine.

285
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,119
People with dirty minds

286
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,320
see everything as dirty.

287
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,159
Why don't you look in the mirror at yourself?

288
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you even worthy

289
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,400
of Young Master Lu?

290
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,039
Linlang is my friend. Do you have a problem with that?

291
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,039
Sorry to bother you.

292
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,280
A perfect match.

293
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,880
Haven't you always disliked

294
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
physical contact with others the most?

295
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,359
But I can't just

296
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
stand by and watch others bully my friend.

297
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,559
We're friends.

298
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
Everyone else dislikes me.

299
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,400
I've never had many friends since I was little.

300
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,919
Then you're pretty much like me.

301
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,200
Ever since I had a fever seven years ago,

302
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
I can't remember a lot of things.

303
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,520
Not to mention friends,

304
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,520
even my family

305
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,799
feels unfamiliar to me.

306
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,520
I, Xu Linlang, always settle scores quickly,

307
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,919
never dragging things out.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,599
Lu Jiu,

309
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,559
from now on, you'll be my best friend.

310
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,359
Doesn't seem like it.

311
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,440
That's right.

312
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,719
Lu Jiu's way of doing things

313
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
really isn't like someone from the Lu family.

314
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,320
But he's an illegitimate child.

315
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,119
It's normal for him not to be welcomed.

316
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,039
Let's not investigate for now.

317
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:47,799
Yes.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,520
I will return and report to the sect leader.

319
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,159
We won't investigate Lu Jiu for now.

320
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,320
The real clue

321
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,359
should still be with Lu Mingcheng.

322
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,359
What about Lu Kun?

323
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
According to my investigation,

324
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,039
Lu Kun handed all his businesses

325
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,960
over to his eldest son, Lu Mingcheng.

326
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,440
He himself has been living in seclusion in Shuicheng.

327
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,880
He has never shown up.

328
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,559
Seven years ago,

329
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,280
there was a rumor in the martial world that Tianluo's top assassin, Fei Ying,

330
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:13,320
found a clue to the Wuxiang treasure.

331
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
After that, he disappeared in Mist Town.

332
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Lu Kun was also in Mist Town at that time.

333
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,359
Could it be a coincidence?

334
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,039
So, young sect leader,

335
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,039
how do you plan to proceed next?

336
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,280
The peach blossoms smell wonderful.

337
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,640
Just like it's written in the storybooks.

338
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,799
Young master,

339
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,919
are you thinking about that

340
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,039
female coroner right now?

341
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,960
I've been to all the famous pleasure boats in the city,

342
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,839
how could I fall for someone so easily?

343
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,199
You're used to rich food,

344
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,119
but sooner or later you'll crave

345
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,920
something light and refreshing.

346
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,439
Nonsense.

347
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,920
Young master,

348
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,680
I just wanted to remind you

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that our study

350
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,040
still has many fascinating detective novels.

351
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,160
You could use them

352
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,119
as a pretext to give her a gift.

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,719
Do you have nothing better to do?

354
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,280
Hurry up and get back to work.

355
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,599
So stubborn.

356
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,199
But you're still going to the study.

357
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,280
Me

358
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,119
I'm here to look for a book.

359
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Men, you know,

360
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,959
always need a little stash hidden from their wives.

361
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
While your sister-in-law hasn't moved in yet,

362
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
I just set up this secret room.

363
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,520
And you've already found it.

364
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,239
Looks like

365
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,359
I need to hide it

366
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,520
even better.

367
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,119
Since that's how you are, brother,

368
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,239
why marry that woman?

369
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,560
That day on the boat,

370
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,680
I could tell

371
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,839
you don't really like your future wife.

372
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,760
I guess

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,199
you're afraid that

374
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,719
she'll take away my affection for you.

375
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,959
We're real brothers.

376
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,239
Even after I get married,

377
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,119
I'll still treat you as the best.

378
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,479
In my heart,

379
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,920
brother,

380
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
you've always been the most important person.

381
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,319
And you are to me, too.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,680
By the way,

383
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,239
I heard last night

384
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,640
you got involved in a case.

385
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
You were at the yamen all night.

386
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
It's all fine now.

387
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,760
Everything's been cleared up.

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
It won't affect your wedding.

389
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
The wedding isn't important.

390
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,599
What I'm worried about

391
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,680
is whether you're alright.

392
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,920
Go back and get some rest.

393
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,199
If you want to read anything,

394
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I'll have the steward send it to you.

395
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,319
Go on.

396
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,199
Thank you, brother.

397
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,160
Even brotherly bonds have to be guarded with such effort.

398
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,959
What other affection could you possibly hope for?

399
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,280
Young master.

400
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,719
What are you doing?

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Where's my elder brother?

402
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
The eldest young master went to the pleasure boat.

403
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,599
He's discussing the wedding with Miss Wan.

404
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,920
He asked me to deliver the dowry to Miss Wan.

405
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,920
Give it to me.

406
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,160
Alright.

407
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,199
You may go.

408
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,239
Yes, young master.

409
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,640
Although I don't like that woman,

410
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
still,

411
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,839
it's my brother's lifelong matter.

412
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,839
As his younger brother,

413
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,640
I should do my part.

414
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,599
You saw how Lu Jiu treats me because of that wretch.

415
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,719
You saw it yourself.

416
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,000
He doesn't even acknowledge me as his sister-in-law.

417
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,680
Isn't Ling'er already dead?

418
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,520
Why are you bringing up someone who's dead?

419
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,680
What about Lu Jiu?

420
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,359
He's just Master Lu's

421
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,760
illegitimate child born outside.

422
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,880
A troublemaker picked up halfway.

423
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,719
With such a large fortune,

424
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,640
do you mean

425
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
you want to give him a share?

426
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,400
He and I are brothers.

427
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,479
All these years,

428
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,880
Xiao Jiu has never

429
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,040
tried to seize the family property from me.

430
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,000
Of course I'll treat him well.

431
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,160
Don't think I don't know

432
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,239
what you're scheming behind my back.

433
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,680
Before,

434
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,920
you secretly approached Ling'er. Shut up!

435
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,119
If you still want to marry into the Lu family,

436
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,079
then keep your mouth shut.

437
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
Big Brother

438
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,599
I... I came to

439
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,800
bring jewelry for Sister-in-law

440
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,119
Your sister-in-law is done tidying up

441
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,560
No matter what

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,680
Big Brother

443
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,040
will always be your Big Brother

444
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
I don't care how you got involved with my brother

445
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,160
But

446
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,439
I'm warning you

447
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,359
Don't even think about stirring up trouble between us brothers

448
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,199
In the past

449
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,160
you treated me like I was nothing

450
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,800
I thought you were just cold-hearted

451
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,520
Turns out you simply don't understand human relationships

452
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,160
Even when some people

453
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,839
pretend to be nice and act fake with you

454
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,079
you can't even tell

455
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:49,959
What do you mean?

456
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,719
I mean

457
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,479
What I mean is

458
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,880
in this world,

459
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,040
only I

460
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,839
am truly sincere to you.

461
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
Everything I do

462
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,959
is for you.

463
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,599
If you just say the word,

464
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,920
I won't get married.

465
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,000
A woman like you

466
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,959
is not worthy of my brother at all.

467
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,040
Then don't blame me.

468
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,439
If I, Wan Lingling, can't have something,

469
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,560
even if I have to destroy it,

470
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,640
I won't let him have it easy.

471
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,040
What are you doing?

472
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,839
Help!

473
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,239
Help! Somebody, come quickly!

474
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,760
He assaulted me.

475
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,800
Help! He assaulted me!

476
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
How could this happen?

477
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,239
How could he do something like this?

478
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,439
I heard about it.

479
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,880
You and that one called Lu Jiu

480
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,920
were out on the street

481
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,119
with your arms around each other

482
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,280
hugging and holding each other

483
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,680
What kind of behavior is that?

484
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,239
Father, what are you talking about?

485
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,959
I've never had many friends since I was little.

486
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,319
Lu Jiu doesn't have many friends either.

487
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,599
He doesn't mind being with me.

488
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,040
We're like brothers now.

489
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,520
What do you mean, brothers?

490
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
You're a girl yourself.

491
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,839
Don't you know?

492
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,119
It's my job that's held you back.

493
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,079
It's made it so hard for you to get married.

494
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,920
I don't want to get married anyway.

495
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,239
Even if I do get married someday,

496
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll still keep doing autopsies and solving cases.

497
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,760
Let's not talk about marriage right now.

498
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,520
Just talking about making friends,

499
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,400
The Lu family is wealthy and powerful.

500
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,760
Can he really accept

501
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,000
a coroner being friends with their young master?

502
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,119
Having any connection at all?

503
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,199
Just because I'm a coroner,

504
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,479
does that mean I can't have friends?

505
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,800
What's wrong with being a coroner?

506
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,239
Young master, young master!

507
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,040
Young master!

508
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,520
Young master, are you alright?

509
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,079
Go away.

510
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,680
Forget it.

511
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,239
Our second young master

512
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,599
doesn't like the new madam.

513
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
Let's hope he doesn't

514
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,760
take it out on us.

515
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,719
That's true.

516
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
The kitchen has prepared a banquet for the servants too.

517
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,880
Let's go have a drink. Come on.

518
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,280
It’s always the new faces who get the smiles.

519
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
No one ever sees the old ones cry.

520
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
In this world,

521
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,920
no one really cares about me.

522
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,359
I, Xu Linlang, settle my debts and favors decisively.

523
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,959
I’ve never liked dragging things out.

524
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,640
From now on, you’ll be my best friend.

525
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,599
No, that’s not right.

526
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,599
I do have a friend after all.

527
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,920
Linlang

528
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,400
Linlang

529
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,880
Linlang

530
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
Linlang

531
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,160
Linlang

532
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,239
Let's get to work.

533
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Linlang

534
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,920
Why are you sleeping in the coffin again?

535
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
This time,

536
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,640
there's a real major murder case.

537
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,439
A big case.

538
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,439
Lu Mingcheng is dead.

539
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,119
He really died suddenly.

540
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,760
Lu Jiu was caught on the spot.

541
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
He's now in custody.

542
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
But the news is completely sealed off.

543
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,199
We can't find out anything.

544
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,560
If Lu Jiu was the killer,

545
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,839
it doesn't add up.

546
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,079
When I woke up,

547
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
the body was already lying on the bed.

548
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,479
That's not right.

549
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,599
Who was that person, really?

550
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
I was guarding the door the whole time.

551
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Who actually left yesterday?

552
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,280
Who was it?

553
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,560
Who was it?

554
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,040
The fatal wound on the victim

555
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,319
was caused by a sharp weapon.

556
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,199
The depth of the wound,

557
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,079
its shape,

558
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,880
and the weapon Lu Jiu was holding at the time

559
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,880
are completely different.

560
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,800
Did Linlang find out the truth?

561
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
What did she find?

562
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,280
You'll know once we're in court.

563
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,479
Let's eat first.

564
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,439
Don't worry.

565
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,439
Our lord,

566
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,119
is famous for being stingy.

567
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,439
Even if he wanted to coax you into confessing,

568
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,400
he wouldn't use such good food.

569
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,800
Someone

570
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,920
specifically asked me to treat you better.

571
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,040
Eat up.

572
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,280
I'm leaving.

573
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,199
I knew it.

574
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,119
You wouldn't abandon me.

575
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,400
The suspect, Lu Jiu,

576
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,520
is suspected of killing

577
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,160
his elder brother Lu Mingcheng and his wife.

578
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,760
Interrogation according to the law.

579
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,439
A murder case

580
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,839
should be tried publicly.

581
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,599
Why did you dismiss everyone?

582
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Are you interrogating me,

583
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,479
or am I interrogating you?

584
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,560
Summon the coroner.

585
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,680
Linlang.

586
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,000
Reporting, my lord.

587
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,079
Upon examination,

588
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,040
the two bodies

589
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,880
Lu Mingcheng and Wan Lingling's physical features

590
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,239
and bone age both match.

591
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,920
The fatal wounds were caused by a blade.

592
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,719
On the bodies, the arms and chest

593
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,560
both show signs of simultaneous bruising.

594
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,119
and

595
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
The knife that Lu Jiu had that day matches.

596
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,000
If I really killed someone,

597
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,199
why would I be foolish enough to stand there

598
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,319
and wait for you to catch me?

599
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,800
Clearly, someone is trying to frame me.

600
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,000
Lu Jiu, acting like this doesn't help the case at all.

601
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,119
Now, every piece of evidence

602
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,000
points to the knife in your hand as the murder weapon.

603
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,040
If you feel you have been wronged,

604
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,640
you can ask a legal advisor to write a petition.

605
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,479
Wait until the next trial—there won't be a next time.

606
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,439
The evidence that Lu Jiu killed his brother and sister-in-law is conclusive.

607
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,199
This case has caused a huge stir among the public.

608
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,400
There is no need to investigate further.

609
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:22,520
But, sir,

610
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,680
there was knockout powder in the wine on the night of the Lu family's wedding.

611
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,359
All the servants were rendered unconscious.

612
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,560
Not a single person was awake.

613
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,400
Even Lu Jiu

614
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,119
showed signs of having taken the knockout powder.

615
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,359
So... so,

616
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,959
Lu Jiu brought this upon himself.

617
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,680
He drank the knockout powder he prepared himself.

618
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,520
That's how we were able to catch him.

619
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,719
Therefore, I hereby announce

620
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,119
this case

621
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,400
has been solved.

622
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,599
It will be reported to the Ministry of Justice.

623
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,959
Corrupt official

624
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,719
Lu Jiu, you corrupt official

625
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,719
The real culprit who killed my elder brother

626
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,079
is still at large

627
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,479
How could you be so foolish

628
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,479
Corrupt official

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Someone, take him away

630
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,079
Order a closed-door trial

631
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
None of the officers have come

632
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,800
Xu Linlang

633
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
You work at the yamen

634
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,920
You go up—right

635
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,199
Sorry

636
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,040
I am a coroner

637
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,160
I can only trust the evidence
