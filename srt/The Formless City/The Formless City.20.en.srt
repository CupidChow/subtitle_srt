1
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,759
I never expected the snowy scenery of Lone Mountain to be so beautiful.

2
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,720
If Linlang saw this,

3
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,479
she would definitely be very happy.

4
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,399
Why is it you again?

5
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,160
Do you really not want to see me that much?

6
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,919
I've told you many times already.

7
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
In the past,

8
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,880
I did live as Fei Ying.

9
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,360
But that was in the past.

10
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,839
You've seen it yourself.

11
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Tomorrow,

12
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,800
I will marry Linlang.

13
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,399
So today, I want to try one last time.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,119
I don't believe Fei Ying has just disappeared.

15
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,520
The Tianchi artifact, the Soul Severing Cord, erased your memories.

16
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,240
Before you lost your memory, you went to the Tianchi cemetery.

17
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,080
There,

18
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,039
you found traces of the Wuxiang treasure.

19
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,039
But you were also seriously injured by the artifact.

20
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,880
That's why you lost your memory in Mist Town.

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,600
Today

22
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,880
is my last chance to bring you back.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
Sentiment

24
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,240
is the most useless thing in this world.

25
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,960
These lashes

26
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,160
are your punishment for disobeying my orders.

27
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:37,639
Fei Ying,

28
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,399
your entire purpose for existing is the Wuxiang treasure.

29
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,399
You trained hard in Dugu City for over ten years.

30
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,080
You became the top master of the inner court for this very day.

31
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,039
If you can't find the Wuxiang treasure,

32
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,720
then don't come back.

33
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,520
You are my father.

34
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,639
Why

35
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,559
in the face of wealth that rivals a nation,

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,240
does so-called family mean nothing?

37
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,360
This is the first lesson your father teaches you.

38
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,360
It might also be the last.

39
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,679
The Wuxiang treasure

40
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,559
will ultimately be mine, Dugu Wumo's.

41
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,160
Lu Jiu

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
Lu Jiu

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
Senior Sister, are you alright?

44
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,079
Fei Ying

45
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,640
You finally came back.

46
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,119
It's time for us

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,559
to go back.

48
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,679
I've waited for this day

49
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,200
for seven years.

50
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
Lu Jiu

51
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,839
Lu Jiu, Lu Jiu

52
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,519
Have you forgotten?

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,839
You said

54
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,519
you would stay with me for life and protect me.

55
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm not Lu Jiu.

56
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm Fei Ying.

57
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,720
By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

58
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,839
Geng Zhao has neglected his duties.

59
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,160
He has deceived the Emperor and defied authority.

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,839
He is to be relieved of all positions effective immediately.

61
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,600
He shall be imprisoned in the Tianluo prison.

62
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,799
This is the imperial command.

63
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,559
I have disobeyed the imperial edict.

64
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,760
I accept my punishment.

65
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,799
Even if Your Majesty does not believe Fengleitang is innocent,

66
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,760
the case

67
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,399
I should still be sent to the Ministry of Justice for trial.

68
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,640
Why is it Tianluo prison?

69
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,799
Lord Geng,

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,600
you have served in the Investigation Bureau for many years.

71
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:18,480
Do you still not understand His Majesty's intentions?

72
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,040
Failing to eliminate Gushan is a minor issue.

73
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,640
Harboring traitors

74
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,799
is the true reason for your conviction.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,559
Take him away.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,519
Wait.

77
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,640
I, Geng Zhao,

78
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,040
have dared to return to the capital to report.

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,359
I will not run away.

80
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
Sir,

81
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,839
Stand down.

82
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Linlang

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,359
Your body can't handle it if you keep going like this.

84
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,399
Even if I recover, what difference does it make?

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
What do you mean by that?

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
Is there really no one else in this world

87
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,000
but Lu Jiu who is worth your concern?

88
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,799
The Linlang who once wanted to serve the people

89
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,160
and solve cases to catch criminals,

90
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,559
where has she gone?

91
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,279
I understand how you feel right now.

92
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,160
Back then, when Lu Jiu was still an infant,

93
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,320
he was taken away.

94
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,480
I also thought I would never see him again in this life.

95
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,119
But I kept searching and waiting.

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,760
Even though twenty years passed,

97
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,640
didn't I still get him back in the end?

98
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,200
You mean

99
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,200
Fei Ying took seven years to recover his memory.

100
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,880
I can also wait for Lu Jiu to regain his memory.

101
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,959
I'll wait with you.

102
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,399
Hyah!

103
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,119
Hyah!

104
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,839
Hyah!

105
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,440
Whoa

106
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,679
Whoa

107
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,040
I'll make two sachets for you.

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,519
They're for repelling insects.

109
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,399
Here.

110
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm willing to never marry for the rest of my life.

111
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,200
To help her fulfill her wish.

112
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,919
Fei Ying, what's wrong?

113
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,320
It's nothing.

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,479
My body just hasn't fully adjusted yet.

115
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,640
I just regained my memory.

116
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,359
Godfather has waited for us for seven years.

117
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,520
Let's hurry back.

118
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:51,880
Giddy up

119
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,320
Giddy up

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,520
Giddy up

121
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,119
Giddy up

122
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,559
Why is that person running so fast?

123
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,719
Maybe he got stung by a wasp.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,039
Fei Ying, you...

125
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
You seem different from before.

126
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,559
Even more...

127
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,799
You like to joke around even more now.

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
It's been seven years.

129
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,280
People change.

130
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,239
You have too.

131
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,440
You've become more attractive.

132
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,520
Giddy up

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,919
Giddy up

134
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,080
You've just started to recover.

135
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,039
Don't catch a chill.

136
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,159
Go back inside quickly.

137
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,320
You can't go in.

138
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
You can't go in. Move aside.

139
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,359
You can't barge in here. I'm here to find someone.

140
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,599
What's going on?

141
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,000
This is the person I'm looking for.

142
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,239
Who are you?

143
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm her uncle.

144
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Uncle.

145
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,119
Is he really my uncle?

146
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,840
Judging by how much he eats,

147
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,239
he really does seem like it.

148
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
May I ask,

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,840
how did you find me?

150
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,760
Thanks to these little ones.

151
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,320
How did the bees know where I was?

152
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,159
That's a long story.

153
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,760
It's normal for you to doubt my identity right now.

154
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,440
After all, we've never met.

155
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,200
And there's no keepsake to prove it.

156
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,239
It's hard to believe.

157
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,440
By the way,

158
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,039
your father,

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,960
he grinds his teeth when he sleeps.

160
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,679
I still remember

161
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,359
the year I first started working as a coroner at the yamen.

162
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,400
One night, in the middle of the night,

163
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,159
someone from the yamen suddenly came to call me for an autopsy.

164
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
I heard your father's teeth grinding.

165
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,440
I thought it was a corpse coming back to life in the coffin.

166
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,359
I was so scared I fainted on the spot.

167
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,840
So, looking at it this way,

168
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,440
he really is your uncle.

169
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,640
Before my father died, he said

170
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,840
as long as I arrived in Mist Town,

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,359
my uncle would come to find me.

172
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,159
Now that I've met you,

173
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,599
I've fulfilled my father's last wish.

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,359
No,

175
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,119
your father,

176
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,039
your father has died.

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,719
It was all done by the Tianluo people.

178
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,599
Darn it, Tianluo.

179
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,599
It's been twenty years,

180
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,320
and we still couldn't escape them.

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,799
I heard Linlang's uncle has arrived.

182
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,479
Hall of Wind and Thunder

183
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,760
Jiangbei Branch

184
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,799
Xu Wenyuan

185
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,599
Greetings, Third Hall Master

186
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,000
You are a former member of the Hall of Wind and Thunder

187
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,679
What is going on here?

188
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,320
Before your father passed away

189
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
He should have told you

190
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,159
Your biological parents

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,679
Should be someone else

192
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,559
That's right

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,239
My father said so

194
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,760
As long as I acknowledge you

195
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,159
You will tell me everything

196
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,520
Back then,

197
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,640
Master Luofeng

198
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,119
did not care about one's background

199
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,119
and recruited talented people from all over the world.

200
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,960
My brother and I

201
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,239
were also fortunate to be recruited into the Jiangbei branch.

202
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,000
Master Luofeng, in order to spread medical knowledge,

203
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,919
invited heroes from all over the land.

204
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,479
Even my brother and I,

205
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
who were just nobodies,

206
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
were invited to join.

207
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
It was a great honor.

208
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,239
Kill!

209
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,039
Who would have thought that the second hall master, Li Chu,

210
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,799
would collude with Tianluo

211
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,440
and attack Fenglei Hall,

212
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,200
leaving it in a bloody massacre.

213
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,080
Luolang

214
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,599
Luolang! Madam!

215
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,559
Hurry, go!

216
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,559
My brother and I

217
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,559
had only just joined Fenglei Hall,

218
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,919
and our faces were still unfamiliar.

219
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,719
Li Chu did not recognize us.

220
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,039
Thanks to Madam's trust,

221
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,520
she entrusted the newborn baby girl

222
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,320
to the care of my brother and me.

223
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,520
This baby girl

224
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,479
was Linlang.

225
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,119
But just like Master Luo,

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
she was born with a unique fragrance.

227
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,799
It was very easy for others to notice.

228
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,440
To cover our escape,

229
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Madam actually...

230
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,719
Alright, come over and have a drink.

231
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,679
In order not to let down the trust of the master and madam,

232
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,159
each of us...

233
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,000
Kept Linlang hidden in the coffin shop

234
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,000
Used medicine to suppress her natural scent

235
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,960
And masked it further with the smell of corpses

236
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,919
Take a break before playing again

237
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,400
The other one

238
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,559
Traveled everywhere

239
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,359
To gather information about Li Chu

240
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,599
To guard against any mishaps

241
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,200
And relied on Fenglei Hall

242
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,000
And their specially raised bees

243
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,239
To sense Linlang's unique scent

244
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,880
And share information

245
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,719
I am actually the daughter of Master Luo

246
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,359
I got it

247
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
Linlang's hairpin

248
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,559
It really matches the earrings Madam gave me

249
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,200
For many years

250
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,239
To protect Linlang's safety

251
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,039
We didn't dare to acknowledge each other

252
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,719
Just a few months ago

253
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,359
We noticed the bees were unusually agitated

254
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,359
And knew something had happened

255
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,320
Linlang's scent could no longer be suppressed

256
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,359
Li Chu would soon discover her

257
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,159
So

258
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,760
I traveled day and night

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
Guided by the bees

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,760
I arrived here

261
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,280
Xu Xiang, Third Master of Fenglei Hall

262
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,679
Respectfully invites the Young Master

263
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,200
To restore Fenglei Hall

264
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Respectfully invites the Young Master

265
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,520
To restore Fenglei Hall

266
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
But I don't know how to do anything

267
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,239
You are just like Master Luo

268
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,400
With a heart to help the world

269
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,960
This is the foundation of Fenglei Hall

270
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,000
Master Luo and his wife, in the afterlife

271
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,479
Would surely want to see you

272
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Complete their unfinished work

273
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,559
Revive Fengleitang

274
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,960
Luofeng's child is not dead

275
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,400
And it's the girl who stays by Feiying's side

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,239
It's been twenty years

277
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,440
I've been investigating all this time

278
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,200
The secret of the treasure Luofeng hid before his death

279
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,520
Unfortunately, my efforts were wasted in the wrong direction

280
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,919
You actually missed such an important clue

281
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,039
You useless fool

282
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm a fool?

283
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,080
Then what are you?

284
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,919
You sent one son to Tianluo as a hostage

285
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,880
And the other

286
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,960
You used as a stepping stone for your ambitions in the martial world

287
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,880
This morning's tea

288
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,159
Wasn't bad, was it?

289
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,320
Ungrateful child

290
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,719
How dare you

291
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,919
I intended to keep you

292
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,520
To restrain Feiying

293
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,239
But now the most crucial clue

294
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,039
Is actually with Xu Linlang

295
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Then you are of no use anymore

296
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,200
In the face of wealth that rivals a nation

297
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,359
Family ties are not worth mentioning at all

298
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,359
This is what you taught Feiying back then

299
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,960
My father

300
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:05,880
Father

301
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,719
I have brought Feiying back, father

302
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,280
Good

303
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,839
I have told you before

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,520
Success depends on human effort

305
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,079
You will surely achieve what you wish for

306
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,839
Feiying has returned late

307
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,160
Please punish me, foster father

308
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,239
It's fine

309
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,959
Get up and speak

310
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,160
Seven years ago

311
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,119
You found the location of the Wuxiang treasure

312
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,359
That was a great achievement

313
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
Father

314
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,119
Fei Ying was injured by a magical artifact in the Tianchi cemetery.

315
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,680
Although most of his memories have already returned,

316
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
he still hasn't recalled anything about the Wuxiang Treasure.

317
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,920
He has yet to remember.

318
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,079
Foster father

319
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,280
You have three pieces of the Wuxiang Treasure map.

320
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,680
The last piece

321
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,439
should be in the hands of the remaining members of Fenglei Hall.

322
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,640
Fei Ying

323
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,319
is willing to retrieve it for you, foster father.

324
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,880
Since you are so filial,

325
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,359
do not disappoint me.

326
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,760
Yes.

327
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,160
Sima Kong

328
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,920
You really are a master strategist.

329
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,959
If it weren't for you,

330
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,760
I would have been riddled with holes by now.

331
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,439
Even though I've lost all my martial arts skills,

332
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,359
being by your side

333
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,479
still means I'm not completely useless, right?

334
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm impressed, truly.

335
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,760
No wonder you're the top strategist of Fenglei Hall.

336
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,239
But

337
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,520
how did you know that person's tactics?

338
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,959
He's from the Tang Clan.

339
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,280
Someone from the Tang Clan?

340
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,839
Thank you, Young Master, for sparing my life.

341
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,439
With this injury,

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,079
I can finally return and report back.

343
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,199
You made sure his wound wasn't fatal,

344
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,520
and he can still go back to complete his mission.

345
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,520
Just like I said earlier,

346
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,560
you're truly a master strategist.

347
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,079
Even when you go easy on someone, you do it so skillfully.

348
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,079
Old Yan is no different.

349
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,920
What do you mean?

350
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,880
He has worked with me for over ten years,

351
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,520
and we both trained in the Tang Clan.

352
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,640
How could he not anticipate my traps?

353
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,680
You always seemed so cold and distant before,

354
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,880
but no one values loyalty more than you.

355
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,319
Look,

356
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,920
you look so nice when you smile.

357
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,520
Are they also from the Tang Clan?

358
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,839
No.

359
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,880
But his moves

360
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,239
seem strangely familiar.

361
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,040
As the mantis stalks the cicada, the oriole waits behind.

362
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,520
With just you all,

363
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,479
Lu Jiu

364
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,920
I'm not Lu Jiu.

365
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,560
Lu Jiu

366
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,280
I trust you won't hurt me.

367
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,439
Stop pretending you understand me.

368
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,079
Why don't we give it a try?

369
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:54,920
Lu Jiu

370
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:55,839
No.

371
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:56,719
Fei Ying

372
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:57,959
Let her go.

373
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,839
I'll do anything you want.

374
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,319
What a pity.

375
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,359
You're someone whose martial arts were crippled by Tangmen.

376
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,560
Trying to negotiate with me.

377
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,079
Are you even qualified?

378
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,239
Lu Jiu

379
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,560
It's not too late for you to come over to the right side now.

380
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,680
Even if you've forgotten everything from the past,

381
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,319
you still can't help the wicked do evil.

382
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,719
I advise you to be honest.

383
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,640
Xiao Jiu

384
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,359
It's you.

385
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,239
Xiao Jiu

386
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,359
It's me.

387
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
Your eldest brother who cares for you the most.

388
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,280
As far as I know,

389
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,079
back in Luoyang County,

390
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,719
you planned an elaborate escape.

391
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,719
You wanted to put me in mortal danger.

392
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,839
Xiao Jiu

393
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,680
Your big brother had his own difficulties.

394
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,119
I don't know martial arts.

395
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,880
My schemes can't compare to yours.

396
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,079
Long ago, I already

397
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,880
became the one Father abandoned.

398
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,479
When I ran away back then,

399
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
it was only

400
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,400
to escape death.

401
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
Today, I came here

402
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,760
just to remind you

403
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,119
to be careful of Father.

404
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:09,920
Lu Jiu

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,199
Don't let him deceive you.

406
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
With Li Chu's cunning,

407
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,359
how could he possibly have time to warn anyone?

408
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,000
Xiao Jiu

409
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,920
I don't have much time left.

410
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,040
I've heard that the Wuxiang Treasure

411
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,800
contains medical texts that can cure all diseases.

412
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,719
I came here today

413
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,959
hoping that

414
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,199
for the sake of our brotherhood,

415
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,359
if you find the treasure one day,

416
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
you could

417
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,640
find a cure for me.

418
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,719
Big Brother

419
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,319
Xiao Jiu

420
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,119
In the past,

421
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
you deceived Lu Jiu like this, didn't you?

422
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
Weren't you supposed to not know martial arts?

423
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,560
So why

424
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,920
did you get exposed so quickly?

425
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:08,959
Fei Ying

426
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,520
Do you think that regaining your memory

427
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,959
and returning to Tianluo

428
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,119
will make Dugu trust you?

429
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,719
You're too naive.

430
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,400
He just

431
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
wants to get from you

432
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,439
the key clues about the Wuxiang Treasure.

433
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,439
Other than that,

434
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,040
you're worthless.

435
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,439
Is that so?

436
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,680
One day,

437
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,719
I'll make you pay.

438
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,280
Let's go.

439
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,119
Fei Ying reporting back.

440
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,359
Good.

441
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,199
You truly are my good disciple.

442
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,800
You scoundrel.

443
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,079
His Majesty established Tianluo to secure the nation.

444
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,920
But you raise assassins for your own gain.

445
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,119
You even slaughtered Fenglei Hall to seize the treasure.

446
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,479
You will face divine retribution sooner or later.

447
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,040
Divine retribution?

448
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,319
I

449
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,359
am the heavens.

450
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,959
Luo Feng.

451
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,400
Do you think that by refusing to confess,

452
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:34,000
I won't be able to find the treasure's location?

453
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,000
Look,

454
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,359
your daughter is in my hands right now.

455
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,959
Do you think I’ll have trouble finding the treasure?

456
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,119
Do you think that regaining your memory

457
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,560
and returning to Tianluo

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
will make Dugu trust you?

459
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,479
You’re too naive.

460
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,599
He only

461
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,880
wants to get from you

462
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,560
the key clues about the Wuxiang treasure.

463
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,199
Other than that,

464
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,760
you’re worthless.

465
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,439
I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.

466
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,680
I’ve never met my birth parents.

467
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,680
Nor have I ever heard of any treasure.

468
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,319
In fact,

469
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,000
I should thank you all.

470
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,479
If you hadn’t been hunting me all this time,

471
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
I would never have learned about my own origins.

472
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,520
Refusing a toast only to be forced to drink.

473
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,239
Guards!

474
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:24,119
Interrogate her thoroughly for me.

475
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,359
Yes.

476
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,280
Foster father.

477
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,599
I was the one who captured her.

478
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,160
Let me handle the interrogation.

479
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,400
I will definitely make her reveal

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,760
the clues to the treasure.

481
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,880
No need.

482
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
You just regained your memory.

483
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,280
You still suffer from frequent headaches.

484
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
I specially invited several renowned doctors

485
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,319
to treat your illness.

486
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,079
But

487
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,719
your marriage with Yemei

488
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,560
has been delayed for so many years.

489
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,560
It's time to start preparing for it.

490
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,119
These trivial matters

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,800
can be left to the subordinates.

492
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,000
Then, Feiying,

493
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,560
I will take my leave first.

494
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,599
Alright.

495
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,479
Feiying.

496
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,520
You're back.

497
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,319
Didn't Senior Sister

498
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,520
come back with me from the forest?

499
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,560
How could you not know when I returned?

500
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,400
Feiying.

501
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,839
I didn't mean to...

502
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,680
I understand.

503
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,079
You are the foster father's daughter.

504
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,560
You have to follow his orders.

505
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,479
Lord Geng

506
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,959
You currently hold no official position.

507
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,599
So I should call you

508
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,119
Brother Geng, right?

509
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,800
His Majesty has long had doubts about the Fenglei Hall case.

510
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,920
He has been suspicious.

511
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,800
That's why he sent me to investigate.

512
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,839
But now he doesn't trust me at all.

513
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:23,920
I suppose

514
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,599
Tianluo and Tang Clan

515
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,280
have put a lot of effort into this.

516
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,359
I really can't tell if you're clever or foolish.

517
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,280
Whoever obtains the Wuxiang treasure will rule the world.

518
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,199
That's why His Majesty fears Fenglei Hall so much.

519
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,239
And you

520
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,079
are siding with the remnants of Fenglei Hall.

521
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,479
You're clearly seeking your own doom.

522
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,400
Aren't you doing the same?

523
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
The Tang Clan values their craftsmanship.

524
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,760
They covet the Wuxiang treasure.

525
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm afraid it's not for gold or silver.

526
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,680
But for what's inside—

527
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,560
the weapon blueprints from the previous dynasty.

528
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,079
But have you ever considered

529
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,400
Dugu Wumo holds immense power over the court

530
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,359
and still seeks the Wuxiang treasure

531
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,479
Could it be that he harbors ambitions to usurp the throne?

532
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
Our Tang Sect

533
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,319
only does business

534
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,239
As for court affairs

535
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,880
we are not concerned

536
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,400
The legendary

537
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,959
blueprints of the previous dynasty's weapons

538
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,160
were enough to cause the destruction of Fenglei Hall

539
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:19,959
If

540
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,079
Dugu Wumo's plot succeeds

541
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,359
and he ascends the throne

542
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,359
would he allow it to remain in this world?

543
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,520
Geng Zhao

544
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,000
do not try to sow discord between Tang Sect and Tianluo

545
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,880
It is because I value your talent

546
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,199
that I came to visit

547
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,199
Do not be stubborn and refuse to listen

548
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,079
or you will harm yourself

549
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,760
and drag others down with you

550
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
You will harm others

551
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,560
Why are you here?

552
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,319
What virtue or ability do you possess, Geng Zhao

553
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,880
to make the princess

554
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,479
in the Golden Throne Hall

555
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
take all the blame

556
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,280
for the rebellion at Gushan by herself?

557
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,319
Though she is a princess

558
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,599
in the Department of Investigation

559
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
she is merely my subordinate

560
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,319
How could she have accomplished all this alone?

561
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,680
His Majesty does not care about this matter

562
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,880
If you fall

563
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,000
Who will restrain Tianluo?

564
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,520
It's just a pity.

565
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,560
Her Highness the Princess has been wronged.

566
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:24,640
Lord Geng.

567
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,520
Please leave.

568
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,560
This cell is to be vacated for Her Highness the Princess.

569
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,680
This concerns the grave crime of treason.

570
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,439
Even Her Highness the Princess

571
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,359
cannot escape the death penalty.

572
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,719
Let them talk a little longer.

573
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,319
On the road to the afterlife,

574
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,000
they can rest in peace.

575
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,959
Don't overthink it.

576
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,000
I just pity the wronged souls of Fenglei Hall.

577
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,119
It's not for you.

578
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,560
Back at Gushan,

579
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,040
I already anticipated

580
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
that defying the imperial decree

581
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,199
would lead to a dangerous path ahead.

582
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,199
I didn't want to implicate you.

583
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,839
I never expected

584
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,520
that in the end, I still harmed you.

585
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,239
Are you saying

586
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,439
that you were so cold to me before

587
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,119
because you didn't want to drag me down?

588
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,319
I, Geng Zhao, have investigated cases for half my life.

589
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,000
I've lived every day on the edge, risking my life.

590
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,959
I never dared to think of burdening someone dear.

591
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,479
Until

592
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,920
I met you.

593
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,400
I knew then

594
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,439
I knew you cared about me.

595
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,920
I should have told you long ago.

596
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,119
Hearing you say that,

597
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,880
I could die without regrets.

598
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,239
Don't worry.

599
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,319
I will definitely get you out of here.

600
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,199
This secret room

601
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,800
was carefully designed just for you.

602
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,000
Even if you can hear sounds from outside,

603
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,520
they won't be able to find any trace of you.

604
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,479
What exactly do you want?

605
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,680
I've already told you, I don't know where the treasure is.

606
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
Do you think that if you refuse to talk,

607
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,920
they'll let you go?

608
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,079
No.

609
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,520
If you have no value to them anymore,

610
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,079
you'll only die faster.

611
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,400
Maybe

612
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,239
they'll even have Fei Ying finish you off himself.

613
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,760
You're just like Dugu.

614
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,319
You only treat him as a killing tool.

615
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,719
You've never really thought about him.

616
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,719
Shut up.

617
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,079
Fei Ying is the most important person to me.

618
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,319
No one understands him better than I do.

619
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,280
No one cares about him more than I do.

620
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,640
You were only with him when he lost his memory

621
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,079
and spent a few days with him.

622
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:58,400
You could never shake my place in his heart.

623
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,880
Why are you getting so worked up?

624
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,520
I guess

625
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,040
Dugu and Feiying

626
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,160
have no idea you came to see me.

627
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,560
That's none of your business.

628
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,920
I'm the one who's winning now.

629
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,920
Feiying was always mine to begin with.

630
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,280
To be honest,

631
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,959
when I first learned you were engaged to Lu Jiu,

632
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,319
I was really heartbroken for a while.

633
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,479
But later, I came to understand something.

634
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,479
The things we've been through,

635
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,920
the people in our hearts,

636
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,000
will only hide in a corner of our hearts,

637
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,719
but they'll never just disappear.

638
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,280
If you can wait for Feiying to come back,

639
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,119
then I can wait for Lu Jiu to return.
