1
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,708
In 1955,

2
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,666
an American game show aired on CBS

3
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,333
called The $64,000 Question.

4
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,208
Audiences could place bets on the answers.

5
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,958
Due to the limited
technological advancements at the time,

6
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,416
live broadcasting across the country
experienced certain delays.

7
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
This delay created
a window for individuals

8
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,541
to manipulate the betting odds
using inside information

9
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,708
gained from the time lag.

10
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,208
The Kelly Bet Size was discovered

11
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,583
by the esteemed
mathematician John L. Kelly,

12
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,958
to maximize the profit from the bets.

13
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,291
People often confuse
the antagonist with the banker.

14
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,708
In fact, the true opponents are

15
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,708
Dirichlet, Bernoulli,

16
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,541
Gauss, Nash,

17
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,041
and Kelly, these masters in mathematics.

18
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,625
Nevertheless, there is
still someone who remains

19
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,416
overly confident about his intelligence.

20
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,375
Meet Pan Sheng,
master's degree in Computer Engineering

21
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
from Hua-Jing University
of Science and Technology.

22
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,375
An expert in Internet
and Information Safety.

23
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,125
He discovered a bug and hacked
into the fintech system of Dian-shi Fund.

24
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,375
Using batch programming,

25
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,833
he inserted a code
that triggered deposits of a penny into

26
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,208
over 80,000 bank accounts.

27
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,500
He accomplished this feat
when he was just turning 20.

28
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,625
TRANSFER 0.01 RMB

29
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,375
Even a brilliant programmer like him

30
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,625
can fall victim to scams,

31
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,125
even selling his life to
a foreign scam syndicate.

32
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,083
RESIDENTIAL AREAS

33
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,333
Now, I'm about to disclose to you

34
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,666
the serious inside story.

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,333
2018

36
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,625
Before online tutoring gained popularity,

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,291
the score was the sole measure
used to evaluate education.

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,291
Online tutoring…

39
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,250
Good day, "Director" Pan.

40
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,000
Stop! Just Pan, okay?

41
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,250
You look great in a suit.

42
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,000
Congrats on the promotion!

43
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,375
Hold it until the official announcement.

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,083
If I really get promoted to K7,

45
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,625
I'll treat you all to a meal and drinks.

46
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,041
Now, I give you our new CTO,

47
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
Kevin.

48
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,291
Do you know who his father is?

49
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't. And I don't care.

50
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,958
It's just a job.

51
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,291
It happens.

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,791
I am leaving.

53
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,750
Quitting?

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,250
Do you have another offer? Come on!

55
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,750
Firefly, a Singaporean game company.

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,041
Look,

57
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,666
the office,

58
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,583
the condo.

59
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,083
All of a sudden?
Without giving it a second thought?

60
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,875
…tried new technologies and architectures.

61
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,000
SYSTEM LOGIN

62
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,083
LOG IN

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,125
In the online education industry,

64
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,041
our customers generally…

65
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,208
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?

66
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,875
The new recruits joining Firefly,
show me where you are, please.

67
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Hello, fellas!
Allow me to introduce myself.

68
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,000
My name is An Jun Cai, Singaporean.

69
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:04,916
I was already in the company…

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,541
Are you not from Hunan?

71
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,333
Yes, I was born in Zhuzhou,

72
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,416
but my family relocated
to Singapore when I was six.

73
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,833
I am from Changsha,
I thought we came from the same place.

74
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,875
How do you know so much about me?

75
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,333
I can read your mind.

76
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,916
Hey, try me!

77
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,875
Your name is Ma Rong. Taurus.

78
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,500
Wang Xiaochuan.

79
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,791
Zhu Liyun.

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,083
Lu Xing.

81
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,708
Did you… hack into
the website of the airline?

82
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,083
No, just your mobile will do.

83
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,958
Genius! Soon we will land in Vanae,

84
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,291
the layover is about ten hours.

85
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,291
Stay close,
just hanging around the airport.

86
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,291
How do we kill time?

87
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,041
I have a plan.

88
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,541
How about this "special" show?

89
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,250
-Do you wanna go?
-Sure!

90
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's do it, as teambuilding.

91
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,208
RSVP me before we land!

92
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,041
Listen to me, they are all crooks.

93
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,458
Just ignore them. Keep moving. Follow me.

94
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,916
Pass your passport over. I'll go check-in.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,291
-There you go.
-Thanks.

96
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,666
Thanks.

97
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,250
Gun!

98
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,791
They have guns!

99
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,458
-Don't take photos. They are on duty.
-It's not a big deal.

100
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,750
-This is our shuttle bus.
-Thanks!

101
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,125
Hop on…
Just leave your belongings to the driver.

102
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,083
I am not in the frame.

103
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,916
Keep up!

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,750
…so fat…

105
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,750
Are we not going to the show?

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,958
Mom.

107
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
I am hanging out with my new colleagues.

108
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry…
International calls cost a lot.

109
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,666
What's going on?

110
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,958
We are tourists.

111
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,708
Run…

112
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,791
Run!

113
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,125
Stop!

114
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,625
Don't move.

115
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,458
Help…

116
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,291
Help!

117
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,833
Help…

118
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,458
Stop. Don't move.

119
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,125
Were you not looking?
Are you blind or what?

120
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,833
I have two mobile phones.

121
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,375
Don't play smart with me.

122
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,916
Tie him up!

123
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,708
You beat them, didn't you?

124
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,791
They are useless without brains.
Can you do their jobs?

125
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,791
Excuse us. I apologize for him.

126
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,500
I am Lu, and I'm in charge.

127
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,208
From now on, you work for me.

128
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,541
Looking forward to your great work.

129
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,791
Stop dreaming!

130
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,500
I wanna go home…

131
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,041
I wanna go home…

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,250
Give them a hand. We are a team.

133
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,083
What you are striving for
will not happen out there

134
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,500
even if you work incredibly hard.

135
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,375
Here, it is not only possible

136
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,750
but will soon become achievable.

137
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,916
Come. Let me show you around.

138
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,250
Go back to work!

139
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,333
We have a diverse range of
business operations, including

140
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,583
investment in stocks,
Bitcoin mining, online gaming,

141
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,416
electronic commerce, and online gambling.

142
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,875

143
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,166
Positioner, hustlers,
enticers, assisting evaders,

144
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,875
informants, enforcer,
mediators, rumormongers.

145
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,458
Have you heard of these?

146
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,791
The "Notorious Eight,"
recognized by venerable masters.

147
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,083
-Good day, Sir!
-Fine.

148
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
These are the hustlers,
also called "doggy-push."

149
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,166
Their job is chatting,
to find the target customers.

150
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Salary is guaranteed at 8,000 RMB.

151
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,750
An additional 0.5%
when the sales reach 30,000 RMB.

152
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,333
The more you do, the more you earn.

153
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,250
Positioner.

154
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,166
They do computer programming,
website development and maintenance.

155
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,166
In this row, they are assisting evaders,

156
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,708
in charge of internet safety.

157
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,458
The salary is 30,000 RMB guaranteed

158
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,458

159
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,208
Mobile devices are prohibited here.

160
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
No external communication is allowed.

161
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,791
Computers are offline and inaccessible.

162
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,625
The authorized individuals with
Internet access are under surveillance.

163
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,125
What's that?

164
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,458
A ginger mountain. Go upstairs.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,083
Who is he?

166
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,958
The guy who escaped yesterday,
and got caught.

167
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,416
Dare to run again?

168
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,583
Speak up!

169
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,750
Here comes the spotlight,

170
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,083

who host online games.

catering to everyone's desires.

175
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,833
Yes, including nude chat.

176
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,333
What do you think? Will you join us?

177
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,000
What do we actually sign up for? Scamming?

178
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,916
Don't say that!

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,666
It's called "SINGBET."

180
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,708
"SINGBET"?

181
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,958
No, I am not interested. Let me leave.

182
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,583
Personally speaking,
I'm bullish on you guys.

183
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,041
How about starting with customer service?

184
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,291
I'll send you back if you can't fit in.

185
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,208
Cai.

186
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,125
Eating is everything.

187
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,291
You will get used to it.

188
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041
I've been here for over six months.

189
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,208
My family will have called the police,
if they haven't hear from me.

190
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,166
Our heads were covered
when we were brought here.

191
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,583
No traces were left for rescue.

192
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,458
Anyway, I will still try to escape.

193
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,125
Send your family a message
saying you're safe.

194
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,625
Give it back to me.

195
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,791
Text your mom.

196
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,625
Tell her something nice.

197
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,750
The scenery here is amazing.

198
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,666
I am having
a good time with my colleagues.

199
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,916
I promise. I won't try to leave again.

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,125
Give me a break.

201
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,375
Be paranoid if you want success.

202
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,458
Disregard everything but money.

203
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,125
Fight once, wealth can
pass three generations.

204
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,541
Fight hard, so failure is not yours.

205
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,708
Today you sleep on the ground.

206
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,666
Tomorrow you will be the boss.

207
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,041
Fighting!

208
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,458
Let's kick off.

209
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Hey, are you alright?

210
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,166
I get my salary.

211
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,916
My wife is pregnant. I'm short on cash.

212
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,125
Mr. Lu told me, he would get my wife
the best hospital to deliver the baby.

213
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,041
Just earning to live.

214
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,666
Do it for money.

215
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,958
Money doesn't matter. I must report it.

216
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,541
Perish the thought.

217
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,375
The server is located
in the Philippines and Cambodia.

218
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,333
They have troops.

219
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,041
Armed.

220
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,916
Can you do web scraping?

221
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,666
-Can you do that?
-No, I can't.

222
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,583
I am asking you a simple question.

223
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,166
Answer me! Yes or no?

224
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,333
Yes or no?

225
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,166
Yes or no?

226
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,583
Can you do that?

227
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,625
No.

228
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,708
Stop it!

229
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,750
Go back to work…

230
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,916
Come on! The show is over.

231
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,625
He will do it if he wants to.

232
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,916
Even if you threaten him
or beat him to death,

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,583
you can't obtain his commitment.

234
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,791
Try again, be nice and polite.

235
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
Sorry, Mr. Pan. My apologies.

236
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,125
Please extract all the information

237
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,666
from the Fansub Groups on the list

238
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
and put me in the loop of all emails.

239
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,166
Can you do that?

240
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,000
All good?

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,583
I appreciate it so much.

242
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,583
HOW DO I WITHDRAW CASH?
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

243
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,625
PLEASE POST THE AD
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO…

244
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,916
SEND

245
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,916
You will die being a whistleblower.

246
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,916
Have they kidnapped you too?

247
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
No.

248
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,125
Didn't you know what they did
before you were recruited?

249
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,166
They told me it was a game company.

250
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,791
After we arrived,
they took my mobile and passport away.

251
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,333
They took mine too.

252
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,208
I can only take it back
after I achieve the sales goal.

253
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,500
How much is the goal?

254
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,041
Five million.

255
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,625
Well.

256
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,125
Can you go out and call for help

257
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,583
if I help you to reach your goal?

258
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,583
Liang Anna is absent from
duty without permission. 2,000 RMB fine.

259
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,541
Why did you lock the door?

260
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,500
Open the door!

261
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,750
Come out! I didn't grant you leave.

262
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,208
You better come out now.
The customer is still waiting.

263
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,208
Will you?

264
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,083
-Good day, Anna.
-Morning!

265
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,625
-Dear K.
-Hey.

266
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,791
Shuang Shuang.

267
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,333
-It's been a while since I saw you.
-It's been a while since I saw you.

268
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,500
-You are back.
-Yes, I am back.

269
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,333
Anna, come with me, please.

270
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,625
Excuse me for a minute.

271
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,166
SINCERE LOVE ONLY

272
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't tell me you are innocent.

273
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,833
The photo is me.

274
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,083
But it was someone using
my photo without permission.

275
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,833
I didn't do this.

276
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,333
Anyway, I inform you
officially on behalf of the company,

277
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,333
your contract is terminated.

278
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,875
-How can you do that?
-Article 7, Section 9:

279
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
If the artist damages the company's image,

280
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,125
the contract will be terminated.

281
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,125
But I am the victim.

282
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,791
That crime has nothing to do with me.

283
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,125
Mr. Ge.

284
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,333
I've known Anna for years.

285
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:09,041
I can vouch for her.
She is not that kind of girl.

286
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,625
Maybe you can give her a second chance?

287
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,166
Don't you understand the quandary?

288
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,333
The cards are spread

289
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,333
throughout the city streets.

290
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,083
Now, we have to replace

291
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,291
all the catalogs with her on the cover.

292
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,000
What about my final payment?

293
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,583
The remaining balance?

294
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,583
Are you kidding me?

295
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,000
I didn't ask for your indemnification,
so you should be grateful.

296
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,291
How can you do that?

297
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,500
Making a fuss about nothing.
What did I do wrong?

298
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,125
You think it is trivial,
but it's a huge loss to us.

299
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,833
You don't see the big picture here.

300
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,916
Come… Anna, come here… I can explain.

301
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,333
Don't you understand?

302
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,041
Excuse us, Mr. Ge.

303
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,791
I got a call from our boss this morning
to suspend your work for six months.

304
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:49,791
Lie low until the furor blows over.

305
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,458
Bastard! What did I do wrong…?

306
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,625
He pays all the bills.

307
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,708
Is Miss Liang single?

308
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,833
Yes.

309
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,625
How can a pretty girl like you
not have a boyfriend?

310
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,666
I haven't found the right one.

311
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,333
How about I introduce you to a husband

312
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,791
instead of finding you a job?

313
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,375
Thanks.

314
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,958
But my mom educated me to be independent.

315
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,833
Men are unreliable.

316
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,625
You better rethink before it is too late.

317
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,750
Women's value depreciates.

318
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,125
Don't be shy. Come over.

319
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,916
Look here.

320
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,458
Welcome! The brand ambassador,

321
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,666
a famous model, Liang Anna.

322
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,333
Cheer for her!

323
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,083
Pretty girl.

324
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,125
Go get changed.

325
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,458
How do I handle this if you drop out?

326
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,750
You told me it was a commercial.

327
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,375
Commercial? Would you earn this
much from shooting a commercial?

328
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,625
Come on. Let's go back.

329
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,875
-Don't touch me.
-Come with me!

330
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,541
Lead the life of a whore
and expect a monument to your chastity.

331
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,791
Are you made of gold or diamonds?

332
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,000
Watch your language.

333
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,416
Hands off.

334
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,833
-What are you doing?
-Hands off.

335
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,625
Excuse us…

336
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,958
-We are fine.
-We know each other.

337
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,666
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

338
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,875
Yes, fine.

339
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,375
Dude.

340
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,333
Is there anything I can do?

341
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:48,916
I booked the room
and scheduled the photographer.

342
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,166
She should pay for that.

343
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,291
I'll need compensation for that.

344
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,541
How much? I'll pay you.

345
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,750
30,000 RMB.

346
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,958
Take the money and get lost!

347
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,333
Leave my friend alone.

348
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,916
Go home and wait for further notice
if you have no other questions.

349
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,541
Thank you, Cai.

350
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,708
You are welcome.

351
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,666
Thank you.

352
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,375
-Are you done watching?
-Yes.

353
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,958
Is this legal?

354
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,541
We run a local business with a license.

355
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,041
It is just an online gaming company.
How bad it could possibly be?

356
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,333
How much can I get?

357
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,250
100-150K RMB per month,

358
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,291
and a bonus,
a percentage from the sold revenue.

359
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,500
-Pretty much like that.
-That much?

360
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,250
In a regular casino,
how many players are in a deck of cards?

361
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,583
Five?

362
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,125
Ten?

363
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,958
There, hundreds of thousands of people

364
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,416
top up and chip in at the same time.

365
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,333
That's how money comes.

366
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,833
Is it hard?

367
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,041
Deal the cards and chat.

368
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,125
Simple as that.

369
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,708
Hey. Don't tease her.

370
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,208
The company is abroad in Canan.

371
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,875
It's not that far. No.

372
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,166
So, you can come
back if you don't like the job.

373
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,750
How will she consider working abroad?

374
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,625
Have you already signed up those girls?

375
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,166
They ain't beautiful like she is.

376
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,958
Hey…

377
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,208
She is my bestie.

378
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,875
-Don't mess with her.
-Sorry.

379
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,291
Let's go.

380
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,041
I'll drive you home.

381
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,125
Thank you.

382
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,833
-You rent it?
-I bought it.

383
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,291
You look stunning.

384
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,291
Do you wanna come along?

385
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,041
No, I better go home.

386
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,708
Okay, suit yourself.

387
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,458
I am not good at English. Is that alright?

388
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,708
They only hire Chinese people.

389
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,375
You don't need to speak English.

390
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,625
I am just a bit scared.

391
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,583
I am one of the shareholders.

392
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,958
Cai is my guy.

393
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,041
He will look after you.

394
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,958
You needn't be subservient on the job.

395
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,791
Everything depends on oneself.

396
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,208
What is most important for women?
Independence.

397
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,208
-Shuang Shuang.
-What's up?

398
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,416
I want to give it a try.

399
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,666
Sure, why not?

400
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,375
I will recommend you
for the recruitment next year.

401
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,041
Next year?

402
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,458
There are no vacancies left this year.

403
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,500
But am I not better than them?

404
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,333
Take me this time, please.

405
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,875
I really need to earn a living.

406
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,791
You should've told me earlier.

407
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,833
For the record,
I can't be sure to get you in.

408
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,791
I bet you can.

409
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,458
I'll wait for your good news!

410
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,583
Okay.

411
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,625
Text me when you get home safe.

412
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,041
-Take care of yourself too.
-Okay.

413
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,166
What's up? Yes or no?

414
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,500
Absolutely yes. She is gorgeous.

415
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,166
Hai. Good work.

416
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,333
Nice working with you.

417
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,916
Anna. Have you been waiting long?

418
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,125
No, not at all.

419
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,208
Take all your belongings with you.
We will walk from here.

420
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,041
How far is it?

421
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,125
It's nearby. No worries.

422
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,208
-Hey, Cai!
-Don't call my name.

423
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,500
Open the goddamn door.

424
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,125
I have to do it myself every time.

425
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,541
You never do a damn thing right.

426
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,083
Squeeze through.

427
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,291
Are you serious, Cai?
We all have passports.

428
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,875
The tourist visa only lasts for two weeks.

429
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,583
Frequent trips may result in blacklisting.

430
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,791
Do you understand?

431
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,083
Hundreds of people make
their way in through it every day.

432
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,291
No one is special.

433
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,375
Go through it, or go home on your own.

434
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,333
-Hurry up!
-Shut the fuck up!

435
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,583
-What are we looking at?
-New girls.

436
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,958
I can see
who you're chatting with on your phones.

437
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,250
No photography or videos are allowed.

438
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,125
No Wi-Fi connection.

439
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,666
Swipe your access card
to enter the dormitory.

440
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,541
Dual authentication is
required for entry and exit.

441
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,375
Passports will be temporarily held

442
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,666
until you reach your sales goal.

443
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,791
What is the goal?

444
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,500
Five million per person.

445
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:30,041
We operate a 24-hour business
with six-hour shifts,

446
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,000
two dealers per group,
and each of you working two shifts a day.

447
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,458
Cai. Get her some water and fruit.

448
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,583
You will do
six hours of recording in a row.

449
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,791
That could be helpful
when you get thirsty.

450
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,541
-No livestreaming?
-We use the recording for the new members.

451
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,750
Let them win on smaller bids.
Then offer some inside dope.

452
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,500
Our team of positioners
can create a webpage in ten minutes.

453
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,041
So everything they see on the game website

454
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,458
is tailored specifically for them.

455
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,083
He will win if we allow it.

456
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,041
He will lose if we make him.

COLOR: WHITE PLATE AND BLACK POINTERS

463
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:18,541
I have a stomachache.

464
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,750
Hang on.

465
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,625
Hey!

466
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,750
Hey!

467
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,958
Liang Anna is absent from duty
without permission. 2,000 RMB fine.

468
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,083
Come out! I didn't grant you leave.

469
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,541
Are you coming out or not?
The customer is still waiting.

470
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,291
I am on my period.

471
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,583
Hide yourself.

472
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:43,833
Sorry, Cai.

473
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,208
I have already paid the fine for you.

474
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,708
Give me a heads-up
if you have the same issue next time.

475
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,666
I can arrange your shifts.

476
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,458
CCTV is on your back.
I was doing a show to cover you up.

477
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,166
Does it hurt?

478
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,791
Open your mouth.

479
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,416
What are you doing here?

480
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,500
Cai.

481
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,333
A big fish is online!

482
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,333
TIAN

483
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,625
You guys are gaming again?

484
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,875
Let's raise the stakes. Bet 1,000 RMB.

485
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,708
Pass the ball, would you?

486
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,916
You don't bet on others winning.
We are a team.

487
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,625
There are still six episodes
to be translated. Hurry up!

Come here.

490
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,250
She is Mai's type, isn't she?

491
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,500
What is this?

492
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:22,541
Oh, nothing.

493
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,666
We just received this in our mailbox.

494
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,541
Their request is to have it displayed
for five seconds at the beginning,

495
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,125
and only three appearances in the middle.

496
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,416
We can earn 3,000 RMB in advertising fees.

497
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,083
So tawdry.

498
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,458
On the other hand,
we occupied Tian's condo

499
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,833
without paying rent.

500
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,583
We will all graduate soon,
and we do need money.

501
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,791
Tian,

502
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,416
you make the call.

503
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,375
Well, I think
we don't do something unidentified.

504
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,333
Let's not get into trouble.

505
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,958
Alright. Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

506
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,458

Banker eight. Player two.

514
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,208
Banker wins.

515
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,833
Banker seven. Player eight.

516
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,000

Martingale Betting System.

520
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,625
No matter how much we lose,
bet double on the next.

521
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,708
Lose two dollars. Bet four dollars.

522
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,666
Lose again, bet eight dollars.

523
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,500
As long as you win that once,
you can leave the game with a reward.

524
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,041
So, the bet is up to 1,024
after ten games.

525
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,625
The probability of
losing ten times in a row

526
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,875
is only one in a thousand.

527
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,083
Can't be that unlucky.

528
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,000
What are you guys doing?
Come out for a group photo!

529
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,750

530
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,083
Hurry up!

531
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,416
Banker nine. Player seven. Banker wins!

532
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,333
He is cleaned out, losing his last stakes.

541
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,583

00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,125

543
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,916

I can't take it.

549
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,166
No, it's not that much.

550
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,416
Take it as a gesture from me,
you can't turn me down.

I'll open them if we can make a deal.

You have no money to pay it back, do you?

618
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,500
-Don't hurt my family.
-Well, you can do something good.

We will begin the blood draw now.

627
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,583
Okay, let's go to the next station!

628
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,333
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing to him?

629
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,500
Don't worry, Yu. Just go home.

630
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,041
He must donate three
times to waive the interest.

631
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,291
-Yu.
-Tian.

632
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,041
-Go back.
-You can't do that anymore.

633
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,916
-You will die from loss of blood.
-Go! Stay out of my business!

634
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,166
Tian. Stop doing this.

635
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,291
Just give up on me, would you? Go away!

636
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:16,791

00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,208
Hello? Uncle and auntie.

638
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:26,708
We better prepare the money.

639
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,458
It's not doing something good.

640
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,583
-They are killing him.
-Don't do this.

641
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,541
There you go.

642
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,375
Can you not harass us anymore?

643
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,958
Your dad got you this old phone

644
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,541
with a new number.

645
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,583
Transfer the loan of 300,000 to him.

646
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,083
Take his Ford Mustang as collateral.

647
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,875
If you can't repay us by next Tuesday.

648
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,625
I'll sell the car.

649
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,708
What are you doing here?

650
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,291
Spying on me?

651
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,083
I promised your parents.

652
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,583
Do me a favor.

653
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:47,625
What?

654
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,541

Place a bet for me.

655
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,000

657
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,458
Write to her.

658
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,833
Bet on South Korea 2:0.

659
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,625

00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,083
South Korea to win 200,000 RMB.

661
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,958
Just to be sure,
buy Germany to win 50,000 RMB.

662
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,833
South Korea to score
the first goal, 30,000 RMB.

663
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,541
Sun Xingmin to score, 10,000 RMB.

665
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,166
Alright. Look.

666
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,708
The game is on!

667
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:23,375
Good evening.
Welcome to the FIFA World Cup.

668
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,958
Hey! Sir, the signal is bad.

669
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:30,916
The live feed is frozen.

670
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:33,250
Fix it, come on!

671
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,666
His feet are showing off their power.

672
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,250
I won!

673
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,333
I won!

674
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:58,875
I won!

675
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,166
You bring me luck.

676
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,958
I finally won.

677
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,583
Yay!

678
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:18,958
I can walk away with a fortune.

679
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,625
We won a lot of money!

680
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,250
I didn't place a bet.

681
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,458
No way. You are kidding me!

682
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,916
How could that possibly happen?

683
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:29,083
It's true. I was afraid of you losing more

684
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,041
so I canceled the bet
before the game was on.

685
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,166
No, you did not.

686
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,708
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CANCEL?

687
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
YES.

688
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,125
Tian.

689
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:19,041
Use the money to redeem the car.

690
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,000
That was your birthday gift from your dad.

691
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,291
Tian.

692
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,916
Did you get hurt? Are you okay?

693
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,500
Don't touch me.

694
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:43,208
Are you okay? Let me check!

695
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:45,500
Do you feel pain? Tell me!

696
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,375
I am sorry.

697
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,791
Forgive me. I was wrong. I am sorry.

698
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:51,750
My bad.

699
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,708
-I am so sorry.
-I am sorry.

700
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,166
Are you okay?

701
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,958
Eat some fruit.

702
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,541
I am good, granny.

703
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,791
I don't want anything.

704
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,375
It's up to you!

705
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,333
I am not being polite.

706
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,041
Look.

707
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,375
Who is this?

708
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,625
I can't see clearly,

709
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,666
I have eye floaters.

710
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,291
Bring it closer for me.

711
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,375
She is your granddaughter-in-law.

712
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,000
Her name is Xiao-Yu.

713
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,416
Xiao-Yu.

714
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
We plan to
get married right after graduation.

715
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:26,958
Yes, marry her.

716
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,666
Good boy.

717
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,250
I've prepared some money, but not much.

718
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,708
It's for you to host a banquet.

719
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,041
A banquet!

720
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,833
No, Granny, we are good.

721
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,208
I can't take it.

722
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,625
-Xiao-Yu?
-Granny.

723
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,208
Where is my dear Xiao-Yu? Xiao-Yu?

724
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,375
Come to me. Xiao-Yu?

725
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,666
Come over.

726
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,250
Granny.

727
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,708
I am not Xiao-Yu. I am Gui.

728
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,541
I am the person that takes care of you.

729
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:14,500
Take this card.

730
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,541
I deposited 150,000 RMB for you.

731
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,875
Is it enough?

732
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,041
I saved this for you on purpose.

733
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,541
The pin code is your birthday.

734
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:42,916
My grandson is the most handsome man.

735
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,083
I have enough for my living.
Don't overthink it.

736
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,833
I need to win.

737
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,333
I must win to cover the loss!

738
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,875
-Zhao.
-Yes?

739
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:57,875
What's the matter?

740
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,708
Her boyfriend was conned out of
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

741
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,416
-Did she file a case?
-Yes, she did.

742
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,916
Excuse me,
your case is under investigation.

743
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,416
We can't reveal the details at this stage.

744
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,750
I heard you are an anti-fraud expert.

745
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,708
Please help me to convince him.
He is not listening to me.

746
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:19,333
Kiddo, we are conducting
widespread anti-fraud campaigns.

747
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:21,250
Can't you see?

748
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,333
The advertisement is even printed on eggs.

749
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:26,250
Many of them
are still getting caught in scams.

750
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,541
Because people have two hearts,

751
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,166
one is greedy, the other is unsatisfied.

752
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,333
So, is he involved in gambling or a scam?

753
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:35,708
Did he mention

754
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,875
something like "inside dope"?

755
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,750
Yes, there is a customer service agent

756
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:40,708
saying things like "guaranteed win."

757
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,500
Okay, that's a 100% fraudulent scheme

758
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,125
using online gambling as bait.

759
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,000
They inserted a Trojan horse
into the gambling software

760
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,166
so they could
acquire and analyze his spending habits

761
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,333
and bank text messages.

762
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,166
They manipulate this data and information

763
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,666
to set up a scheme precisely,
assign the loan,

764
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,000
provide the so-called inside dope,

765
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,416
and control
the victims' feelings and mindset

766
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
by employing a pattern of
alternating wins and losses.

767
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,666
Regardless of age or academic achievement,

768
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,000
they are not afraid of you winning

769
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,000
but of you not playing.

770
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,500
Do you have the original email?

771
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,375
Yes, I do.

772
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:10,833
That's helpful. I hear you.

773
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,416
Go back and wait for the news.

774
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,625
That email was sent to 83 email addresses.

775
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,958
82 of them are sent to
"Subtitle Group" and "Resource Site."

776
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,541
Only one is not.

777
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,791
To whom is it sent?

778
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:23,791
The email address belongs to Mr. Gao,

779
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,166
who works at a firm called "Yun Zhi Wen,"

780
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,291
an online education company.

781
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,708
Tian.

782
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,291
You haven't eaten anything for days.

783
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:35,916
My boy,

784
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,125
eat some congee.

785
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:43,958
What are you doing?

786
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,083
Why did you lock me in?

787
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,791
Please stay home.

788
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,791
Where is my phone? I want my phone.

789
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,833
-I have better luck using my mobile.
-Be good.

790
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,125
-Stop it--
-I want my phone!

791
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,375
As long as you stop--

792
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,791
Give me back my phone!

793
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,791
Give me my phone!

794
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,541
My phone…

795
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,500
Do you hear me?

796
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,750
You are freaking me out.

797
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,333
Where do you keep my phone?

798
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,041
In the safe…

799
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,375
Don't do that, please!

800
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,208
What is the code?

801
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,208
Give it to me!

802
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,458
I can't tell you.

803
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,458
-Tell me or I kill myself now.
-What are you doing?

804
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,541
Don't hurt yourself!

805
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:24,625
Tell me or not? You force me to die.

806
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,583
Stop! I can't let you hurt yourself.

807
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,291
Please stop!

808
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,125
Stop crying!

809
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,500
How did it come to this?

810
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,083
He is back online,

811
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,125
asking if there is any inside dope.

812
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,458
Tell him.

813
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,375
It's too risky.
We are not doing that anymore.

814
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:37,708
Now we invest in Ethereum.

815
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,000
Do it.

816
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,041
You don't know how to spell?

817
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:48,750
IT'S TOO RISKY. WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
NOW WE INVEST IN ETHEREUM.

818
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,666
He asked if he could participate.

819
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,416
No. Tell him no.

820
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:55,041
Tease his appetite.

821
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,333
Tell him it's hard to get in.

822
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,416
Don't be greedy.

823
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,000
Play on something affordable.

824
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:01,666
What he has earned is not enough to quit.

825
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,416
WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER.
WHY DON'T WE INVEST TOGETHER?

826
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,416
He wants a seat at the table.

827
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,791
I own this property.

828
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,083
Look around
and take your time to consider.

829
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:14,416
Mai.

830
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,041
Stay with me, please.

831
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,166
According to the agreement,
if the payment is due,

832
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,958
we will take over the house
and proceed to auction it.

833
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,333
Do you need to
confirm again with your parents?

834
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,500
I HAVE MONEY, EIGHT MILLION,
PLEASE HELP ME TOP UP ALL OF IT.

835
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:35,916
TIAN

836
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,916
He is calling us now.

837
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:38,666
Get Liang Anna to answer.

838
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,583
She is on the stage.

839
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,166
Yu!

840
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,583
Have you seen Tian?

841
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,875
We can't reach him anymore.

842
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,166
Asking for me?

843
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,583
Pick up the call.

844
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,833
Tell him exactly what I told you.

845
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:18,958
Log in to my account.

846
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:21,166
The password is 255125.

847
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,958
I have eight million dollars ready.

848
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,291
Join me in investing with shared funds.

849
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,750
I will take
a 30% commission on your profit.

850
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:34,916
TOTAL ASSETS

851
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,833
We got him.

852
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,333
Keep him on the line,
saying the fund is yet to be received.

853
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,541
What are we waiting for?

854
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:43,791
Hurry up!

855
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,500
The bank is closed,
so the fund transfer is delayed.

856
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,875
Because of
the substantial amount being sent,

857
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,791
the fund will be
received by several accounts.

858
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,458
Call Q to check our receiving accounts.

859
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,041
Five minutes, countdown from now.

860
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,375
Let's go!

861
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,166
Time to work!

862
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:25,208
PAYEE

863
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,875
CONFIRM

864
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,625
The price is up.
The price is really going up.

865
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:34,791
See?

866
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:37,750
Over $8,000 USD last Friday.

867
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,541
And it reached more than $10,000 USD.

868
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,583
An 8-million-dollar
large-scale transfer is detected.

869
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,583
We have control over accounts
at both secondary and tertiary levels.

870
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,875
-Who is making this transfer?
-A mortgage company.

871
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:48,041
The recipient is not in Xianjiang.
It's in Jiangsu.

872
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,291
A cross-provincial case?

873
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,750
Did you find him?

874
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,250
No, he is not answering.

875
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,583
Hello. We are calling from
the Anti-Fraud Center of Xianjiang City.

876
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,833
The transaction that you just made is
highly possible to be a premeditated scam.

877
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:00,416
I am--

878
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,083
Withdraw it all in ten minutes.

879
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,541
Ten minutes. Hurry up!

880
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,041
Withdraw it all. Ten minutes.

881
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:10,333
Ten minutes. Hurry up!

882
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,000
Uncle. He is in the studio.

883
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,208
He is there.

884
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,791
We can chase to the tertiary levels,
but no further.

885
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,625
The accounts are too separated nationwide.

886
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,875
Notify everyone in the group
that the loss will be theirs

887
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,291
if the money
is frozen within five minutes.

888
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,291
Copy that.

889
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,583
Can you speed up?

890
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,416
IT'S ALMOST DONE. WAIT A MOMENT.

891
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:51,750
ARE YOU THERE?

892
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:55,333
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

893
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:56,250
What happened?

894
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,666
THE OTHER PARTY HAS BLOCKED YOU.

895
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,250
Anna has just blocked me.

896
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,833
You can't trust her anymore!
She is a fraudster, can't you see that?

897
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:06,333
We knew each other for a while.

898
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,458
She gave me those inside dopes.

899
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,791
-But she has deleted us anyway--
-Shut up!

900
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,791
Tian.

901
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,416
We can start over.

902
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,833
How do we do that?

903
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,250
You tell me how?

904
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,375
-I am totally fucked.
-Tian.

905
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:28,625
Song Yu is at the door,
and your parents too.

906
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,833
Tian. Open the door!

907
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,583
Tian… Open the door! Tian!

908
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,083
-Tian…
-I let them down.

909
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,625
Do you know what you have done?

910
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:37,083
Do you know how anxious
your parents are when you're hiding?

911
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,750
-I let her down.
-Tian!

912
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,000
Open the door, Binlang!

913
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,708
I let my granny down.

914
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:46,875
Tian. Open up, Tian…

915
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,458
Tian.

916
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,458
Are you alright?

917
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,875
I am begging you.
They are all coming for you.

918
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,250
Shall we open the door?

919
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,250
What are you doing, Tian?

920
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,833
Open the door! Binlang… Open the door!

921
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:01,583
Tian.

922
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:02,958
Do you know what you have done?

923
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:05,250
Do you know how anxious
your parents are when you're hiding?

924
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:06,791
Tian. Come back to us!

925
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,541
Tian!

926
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,375
Good work.

927
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:17,083
Be happy. Safe and sound.

928
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:24,208
-Spicy Stir-Fried Pork.
-Thank you, sir.

929
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,083
Have you called
your family to report your safety?

930
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:27,916
Aren't we not allowed to use our phones?

931
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,875
-Go and ask him for yours.
-Alright.

932
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,375
-Keep this as a secret between us.
-Okay.

933
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:35,041
But do remember to tell them that

934
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,541
it is not easy to work far from home.

935
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,666
You can't go back often.
Ask for their understanding.

936
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,791
Okay.

937
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:49,166
Next, let's welcome
today's key contributor.

938
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,291
Anna!

939
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:54,958
You can see that

940
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,916
their team performance
is outstanding with hard work.

941
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,083
This year's turnover has
already exceeded 60 million.

942
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,791
Today is also a special day

943
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,333
for Pan Sheng.

944
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:07,291
Come up to the stage.

945
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,375
Come on!

946
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,083
Today,

947
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,375
is Pan's

948
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,125
30th birthday.

949
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,791
So, let's all celebrate with him.

950
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,833
Happy Birthday!

951
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,291
Let's sing the song. Come on!

952
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,791
How do you know today is my birthday?

953
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,416
Of course I know.

954
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,250
I have your passport. I know everyone.

955
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,541
You can't remember everyone.

956
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,083
Of course I can't.

957
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,166
Too many to memorize.

958
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,583
I only remember yours
because you are the most special one.

959
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,000
Look.

960
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:04,166
We make money from those losers

961
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,291
and we provide it to our brothers

962
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,291
to support the families they have.

963
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,000
Their actions are driven by greed.

964
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,666
Can you blame us for their choices?

965
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,416
Come. Let's play a game.

966
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:21,500
Everyone.

967
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,750
Use your chopstick to pick up money

968
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,875
as much as you can,

969
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:30,041
but each of you has only one shot!

970
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,333
Let's get the party started.

971
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,958
Are you a dumbass?

972
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,416
Take a bite!

973
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,583
I don't even know what date it is

974
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:24,791
since arriving here.

975
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,916
Surprisingly, Lu remembers it.

976
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,750
He likes you, I can see that.

977
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,416
Don't leave. Let's stay together
and make some money.

978
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,291
Anna. Lu is looking for you.

979
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,541
Congratulations!

980
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,000
You can leave now after reaching the goal.

981
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:08,375
But you have a better option here.

982
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:10,750
What is that?

983
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:12,708
Marry me.

984
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:17,166
I am serious.

985
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,708
I have prepared our retreat.

986
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:32,166
You have to make 20 million more for me.

987
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,333
Why?

988
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:37,125
I thought we had a deal.

989
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,083
Kneel down.

990
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,750
Kneel down.

991
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,291
Be my good girl.

992
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:06,916
Come here.

993
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,083
Kneel down. I am not saying again.

994
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,833
Do it.

995
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,916
-Manager Lu?
-Who is there?

996
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,958
It's me. Pan Sheng.

997
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,000
We'll talk tomorrow!

998
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:20,166
I've had a change of heart.

999
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,500
Let's work together.

1000
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,875
I set up a dynamic password for you,

1001
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,666
turning your mobile into the only
terminal that can access the server.

1002
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,833
In case of three failed password attempts,

1003
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:43,666
the server will be
automatically formatted.

1004
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,291
I want to create an automated program that

1005
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,708
integrates all customer service functions
into the app.

1006
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,125
After scanning the QR code for newcomers,

1007
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,000
they will be redirected to a group

1008
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:58,000
where all leader accounts
are operated by AI.

1009
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,791
The app will also
include an embedded slider

1010
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,375
for matching these users
with their capital,

1011
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,625
resulting in higher efficiency.

1012
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,958
Manager Lu.

1013
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:17,708
The efficiency of
human staff is too sluggish,

1014
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,625
maintaining them is a waste.

1015
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:22,083
It's better to set them free.

1016
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:24,375
You can save
a significant amount of money.

1017
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,083
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

1018
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:30,041
May I have my laptop
and hard drive back, please?

1019
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,041
And my phone.

1020
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,083
I texted a few on WeChat.

1021
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,916
MAIN, PROMOTION

1022
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,208
GAO

1023
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,875
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

1024
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:56,833
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

1025
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,791
Why did you sleep here?

1026
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:22,041
It's my punishment.

1027
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:26,458
Put on a little of this.

1028
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,666
Thank you.

1029
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,458
Let me do your back.

1030
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,500
He is not letting me go.

1031
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,416
That's fine. I'll figure something out.

1032
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,583
See, how pretty she is.

1033
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,208
Pan Sheng is a prodigy.

1034
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,583
Say hi!

1035
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:00,458
Good day, sis.

1036
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,458
My daughter, Yueting.

1037
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:05,500
She just transferred here.
I am showing her around.

1038
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,041
You guys may continue.

1039
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,250
I'll leave you two.

1040
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:39,250
GLOBAL CONSULAR PROTECTION AND SERVICE
EMERGENCY CALL CENTER TELEPHONE NUMBER

1041
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,458
We are going to take photos
to let your family know you're safe.

1042
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:52,083
Don't talk to any strangers.

1043
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:53,166
Understood?

1044
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,541
Give that to me! They go easy on me.

1045
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,833
I'll try to spend it.

1046
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:00,208
-Can you do that?
-Yes.

1047
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,708
You guys haven't been photographed yet.

1048
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,291
Here we are. Smile. Give me a smile.

1049
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,875
Big one.

1050
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:18,375
Three, two, one.

1051
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,833
Okay. Very nice.

1052
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,000
Now, your turn.

1053
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:25,583
He is being blocked. Move aside…

1054
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,708
Take a group photo! A big smile!

1055
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,083
Quiet. It's time for class.

1056
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:57,791
-Thanks, Anna, for this treat.
-You're welcome.

1057
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:02,708
Sorry,

1058
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,958
we don't take US dollars,
only Canan dollars.

1059
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,625
Be careful.

1060
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,041
I'll get the bill.

1061
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:23,541
We are in hurry

1062
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,500
catching a flight.

1063
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,625
Go.

1064
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:34,875
Is this your money?

1065
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,250
Is it yours?

1066
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:43,750
We are together.

1067
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,833
Take the money out and bask in the sun,
otherwise, it will all get moldy.

1068
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:14,833
One more.

1069
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:17,291
Our new team leader of positioners,
Pan Sheng.

1070
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,541
Next, we invite Pan to say a few words.

1071
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,208
I worked for an online education company

1072
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:32,958
for six years.

1073
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,708
Three hundred and eighty hours per month.

1074
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:37,458
Almost always no days off.

1075
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:40,833
Dreaming every day of getting promoted

1076
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:42,083
and earning a raise.

1077
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,666
After I joined this company,

1078
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,333
with Lu's support,

1079
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:50,000
we have both

1080
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,625
money and respect.

1081
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,291
Isn't it great?

1082
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:55,583
Fight once.

1083
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:56,791
Wealth can pass three generations.

1084
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,875
Only through desperate
efforts can we avoid failure.

1085
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:00,791
Sleep on the floor today.

1086
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,833
Fuck your boss tomorrow.

1087
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,333
Who dares to fuck me!

1088
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:10,666
Alright, you got the boot.

1089
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,500
No need to come to work tomorrow.

1090
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,291
Seriously?

1091
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:19,000
Do you remember the rule?

1092
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:20,583
Yes, sir.

1093
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:22,458
What happens here, stays here.

1094
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:23,750
Okay. You are all dismissed.

1095
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,791
Let's go home!

1096
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,583
Thank you.

1097
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:44,416
I can finally go home
to look after my wife.

1098
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,208
Tai. He hit the jackpot!

1099
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:19,958
I sold all the hustlers out
at 30,000 RMB each.

1100
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,166
I thought they were released.

1101
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,375
Do you know how costly it was
to train them as hustlers?

1102
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:25,791
How can I just set them free like that?

1103
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:29,041
What's the time?

1104
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,250
Did you finish your homework?

1105
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,375
Cigarettes?

1106
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:44,500
I am out. There is a convenience store.

1107
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,083
I don't have cash with me.

1108
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,458
Do you?

1109
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:49,500
Sell them out and we will have some.

1110
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,833
Take off the hoods.

1111
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,625
Does anyone have cash?

1112
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,125
Do you?

1113
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,291
You better not.

1114
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,750
I will beat the shit
out of you if I found some.

1115
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,875
You?

1116
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,625
What a liar.

1117
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:08,791
You have cash here.

1118
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,666
Thanks.

1119
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,083
Two packs of Marlboro.

1120
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:26,083
Twenty for two packs,

1121
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:27,416
more than enough.

1122
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,750
The bank won't take this banknote

1123
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:41,666
with writing on it.

1124
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,291
Plus, three multiplied by two.

1125
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:56,416
Concentrate.

1126
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,791
What is three multiplied by two?

1127
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,458
Three multiplied by two…

1128
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,166
-Equals six, right?
-Yes.

1129
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,958
What about this one?
Five multiplied by two?

1130
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:08,958
Five multiplied by…

1131
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,708
Close the door…
We have something to figure out.

1132
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,166
Come over, this way.

1133
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,291
Move, quickly.

1134
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,416
I need all of your attention.

1135
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,000
Quiet.

1136
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,416
Hello. This is the 12308 hotline

1137
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,625
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'

1138
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,208
Global Consular Protection
and Service Emergency Call Center--

1139
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,666
Emergency number.

1140
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:37,208
Someone wrote
a distress call phone number on this bill.

1141
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,750
What does "505" mean?

1142
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:44,208
I offer you jobs.

1143
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,625
I give you money.

1144
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,291
Have I ever mistreated you?

1145
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:50,458
-No.
-Ask yourself?

1146
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:52,166
No.

1147
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,958
So, who is this whistleblower

1148
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,791
trying to destroy everything we have here?

1149
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,250
Is it you?

1150
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,666
Or you?

1151
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:15,833
-It's me.
-I wrote it.

1152
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:24,166
Who the fuck did this?

1153
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,166
The handwriting is mine.

1154
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,333
Leave her alone. I wrote it.

1155
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,708
I have always cared for
the company as if it were my home.

1156
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:45,500
Even though there are
certain requirements from the leadership,

1157
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:48,250
sometimes I do give some leeway.

1158
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:50,375
Cai. Open the door!

1159
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,416
Count to three.
You can leave now if you want to.

1160
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,708
Pan.

1161
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,083
Do you wanna go?

1162
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,541
I do.

1163
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:05,791
I want my freedom.

1164
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,541
Can you be free after leaving? Three.

1165
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,125
Go.

1166
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,333
Let's go.

1167
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,375
Weren't we all deceived to come here?

1168
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,583
-And now we're deceiving others.
-Two.

1169
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:21,416
Let's go!

1170
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,708
What's the point of scamming people here?

1171
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,041
One. The door is closed.

1172
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,541
Thank you all for staying together.

1173
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:33,208
However, each country has its own laws
and each family has its own rules.

1174
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,416
Mr. Lu…

1175
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,291
Let her go. I beg you. Mr. Lu. I did that.

1176
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:39,083
-Cai.
-Mr. Lu…

1177
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,416
Mr. Lu--

1178
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,708
The writing is mine.

1179
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:21,541
I'll take the punishment.

1180
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:24,250
Yes, I am punishing you, not her.

1181
01:24:33,291 --> 01:24:35,000
You came here together, didn't you?
He is your friend.

1182
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,750
We came here together.

1183
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:38,708
Break his leg.

1184
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,083
Harder.

1185
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:54,375
Sorry, mate. Bear with me.

1186
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:26,958
Start working now.

1187
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,791
Hurry up!

1188
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,583
Damn.

1189
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,541
Nobody move!

1190
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:19,833
Stay still.

1191
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:23,916
Where is she?

1192
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:01,750
Help!

1193
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:03,708
Some people were kidnapped.

1194
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:05,625
Someone has been shot and killed.

1195
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,291
Hold on.

1196
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,666
This is the police station.

1197
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,916
Come and pick up your girl.

1198
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,916
-Chong says thank you to you.
-Please don't say that.

1199
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,083
It's me expressing
gratitude for Mr. Chong's support.

1200
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,750
Put some stones in.

1201
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:39,791
INTERNET FRAUD

1202
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:49,333
Song?

1203
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:54,291
It's really you!

1204
01:30:57,416 --> 01:30:59,666
What are you doing here?
Do you study here?

1205
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,000
Yes.

1206
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,583
I am volunteering here.

1207
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,541
Where is your boyfriend?

1208
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,958
Have him come here
so I can personally educate him.

1209
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,583
He committed suicide.

1210
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:15,125
He mortgaged
his house to speculate on Ethereum,

1211
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:17,291
was swindled out of eight million,

1212
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,583
and jumped off a building.

1213
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:23,875
I am so sorry to hear that.

1214
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:25,916
Trust me.

1215
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,750
The investigation
of the case is in full swing.

1216
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,875
I hope for news every day,

1217
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,166
try to be useful and do something
at least. So, I serve as a volunteer,

1218
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:38,291
repeatedly telling others

1219
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:41,166
not to believe it, not to be greedy,

1220
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:43,083
and to think again before doing it.

1221
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,416
Zhao, let's take a group photo together.

1222
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:56,458
Be happy, and say cheese!

1223
01:31:56,541 --> 01:31:58,541
One, two, three!

1224
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,000
Zhao, could you please smile for a moment?

1225
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,625
We'll try it one more time. Alright.

1226
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,916
Look here, and smile.

1227
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,208
One, two…

1228
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:13,041
Excuse me.

1229
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:24,500
Give me a moment, please.

1230
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,416
Come to me when the event is over.

1231
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:44,625
Honestly, I feel sorry
and regretful all the time.

1232
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:47,708
Why?

1233
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:49,750
That day, he was
gambling on football matches.

1234
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,333
He asked me to place a bet for him,

1235
01:32:52,416 --> 01:32:54,250
but I secretly canceled it.

1236
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:57,666
He could have won several million.

1237
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,625
Winning would have
allowed him to get out of trouble.

1238
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:01,500
The betting is be locked for a few minutes

1239
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:03,375
before and after a crucial goal.

1240
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,791
The bookmakers
manipulate the odds behind the scenes.

1241
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:06,291
Even if he won,

1242
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,500
the gambling platform
wouldn't honor the payout.

1243
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:12,041
However, he has
successfully withdrawn funds before.

1244
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:14,541
The withdrawal only releases frozen funds.

1245
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:17,750
After 24 hours, it automatically
returns to its original path.

1246
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:21,625
Zhao. When can they be caught?

1247
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,291
If there is something
missing in your house,

1248
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:25,083
and you suspect the neighbor stole it.

1249
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,916
Can you just rush into
the neighbor's house to search?

1250
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,833
It's similar, that is to say,

1251
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:32,208
the Chinese police

1252
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,708
do not have jurisdiction overseas.

1253
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:39,291
So you can't do anything about it, right?

1254
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,958
No, we can handle it.

1255
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,125
We will definitely handle it.

1256
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:51,541
-Don't move.
-Stay still.

1257
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,250
Stay down.

1258
01:34:53,333 --> 01:34:54,458
Don't move.

1259
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:58,250
Don't move.

1260
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:14,291
LIANG ANNA

1261
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,125
Where is Anna?

1262
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,791
She's dead.

1263
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,791
"H"ERE, "E"VERYONE
"L"EARNS MANY WAYS TO "P"LAY.

1264
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,541
HELP ME

1265
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:07,708
HELP ME. I HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY FORCE.

1266
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,625
Mom.

1267
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:44,333
-Stop! We are police!
-They are not cops!

1268
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:46,125
Don't run!

1269
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:49,208
-Help!
-We are police.

1270
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,416
Help!

1271
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,291
They are not cops! They are fake cops!

1272
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:05,625
Stop, don't run.

1273
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:14,041
Stop, don't run. Crouch down…

1274
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:16,875
Help!

1275
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,416
Stop shouting! Don't shout.

1276
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,041
Are you Liang Anna? Are you?

1277
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,750
I am from
the Xianjiang City Public Security Bureau.

1278
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,250
We are here to help you.

1279
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,708
Look closely.

1280
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,625
You have mistaken me.

1281
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:35,083
I am not the person you are looking for.

1282
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:38,208
Li Shuang.

1283
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:39,875
Is she your friend?

1284
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:43,250
She has been
arrested on suspicion of fraud.

1285
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:02,083
There is a loophole in the software.
It got caught by the police.

1286
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:04,416
Can you rewrite it? Would you do that?

1287
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:21,208
Can you do that?

1288
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,375
My name is Zhao Dongran,

1289
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:09,833
from the Criminal Investigation Division
of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

1290
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:13,458
Where have you been for the past
few months? What have you been doing?

1291
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:15,041
I have been in Xianjiang.

1292
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,416
I didn't go anywhere.

1293
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:28,291
It's about to start. Listen carefully.

1294
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:34,541
Initially, I was just killing time.

1295
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,833
A few hours in the afternoon
would just pass quickly.

1296
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,083
I earned 20 RMB per order.

1297
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,875
more than 100 orders
can be handled in a day.

1298
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,250
I was earning more
than from my regular job.

1299
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:47,291
Then, I started placing bets
consecutively.

1300
01:39:47,375 --> 01:39:48,208
Where is the money?

1301
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:49,583
When the orders accumulated
over 100,000 RMB,

1302
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,500
the customer service agent
suddenly disconnected.

1303
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,125
At first I won,

1304
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:57,625
I thought of making
extra money for groceries.

1305
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:01,625
But I didn't win anything
for several months in a row.

1306
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,375
My mother-in-law
noticed my gambling addiction,

1307
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,625
and forced my husband to divorce me.

1308
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,958
I met that guy online.

1309
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,416
The first time I saw his photo,

1310
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,625
I thought he was really handsome.

1311
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,125
His posts on social media

1312
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,208
were filled with photos of red wine,

1313
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,791
vacations, first-class cabins,

1314
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,416
and luxury hotels.

1315
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,666
So, I couldn't help but ask him,

1316
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,000
what he did to earn so much?

1317
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:28,458
No matter how hard I work,

1318
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:30,500
I could never afford those things.

1319
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:31,958
That's why I wanted to make quick money.

1320
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:33,500
Money begets money.

1321
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:34,875
Listen to the advisors.

1322
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:37,000
Invest in US stocks,
Hong Kong stocks, even Thai stocks,

1323
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:38,291
and the SET.

1324
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:40,041
PAY 2,000 RMB NOW

1325
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,750
Smartphones make
it easy for us to hail rides,

1326
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:44,416
order deliveries, and get takeout.

1327
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,583
It's becoming increasingly convenient,

1328
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:49,250
but it also makes scams easier.

1329
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:51,083
The victims suffer from broken marriages,

1330
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:53,416
separated families, and countless cases
of complete devastation.

1331
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,833
Generations of savings

1332
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:57,125
are wiped out in an instant.

1333
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:13,916
We hope that those who have any clues

1334
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,500
can come forward

1335
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,500
and help us.

1336
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,791
Over 20 fractures,

1337
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:28,041
liver and spleen ruptured,

1338
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:30,000
rib bones just half a centimeter away

1339
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,583
from piercing into the heart.

1340
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:33,875
His life was saved,

1341
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:37,875
but he may never wake up again.

1342
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,500
You only knew each other
for two or three months,

1343
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:43,875
but I've known him for four years.

1344
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,458
I never imagined

1345
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:49,250
that he would trust you more than me.

1346
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:52,250
I don't know him.

1347
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,458
Alright,

1348
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:59,333
let me introduce him to you.

1349
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:02,958
His name is Gu Tianzhi,

1350
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:05,291
a graduate with a master's degree.

1351
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:07,333
He just found an internship position

1352
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:09,958
and was about to start
a new chapter in his life.

1353
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,291
He is currently in a deep coma,

1354
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:17,041
no different from
being in a vegetative state

1355
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:20,458
except for his breathing and heartbeat.

1356
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:23,083
I've mentioned breaking up,

1357
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,708
even hoped he would
actually die and put an end to it.

1358
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:33,583
Okay, let's take a rest for now. Let's go.

1359
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,583
Tian is indeed despicable,

1360
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,166
but I truly wish

1361
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:45,916
that the person lying half-dead
in there wasn't him,

1362
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,416
but you.

1363
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,791
Alright, let's go.

1364
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:54,916
Take a rest.

1365
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:00,125
Tian's parents are there.

1366
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,083
Do you want to apologize to them?

1367
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:14,625
I know you were deceived too.

1368
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:17,791
Many people need your help now.

1369
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,666
PAN SHENG

1370
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:23,875
Do you recognize him?

1371
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:33,083
The Central Committee of
the Party attaches great importance to

1372
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,416
the work of combating and controlling

1373
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,791
telecommunications
and online fraud crimes.

1374
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:39,458
It directly concerns
the vital interests of the people,

1375
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:42,666
the security and stability of society,

1376
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,333
and the image of
the Party and the country.

1377
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:47,583
We will target the masterminds,
dismantle the criminal networks,

1378
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,875
shut down the platforms,
and cut off their funding.

1379
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:53,666
Now, I announce that Operation Anti-fraud

1380
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:55,750
will officially commence.

1381
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:16,125
I am the President of the Vanae
Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce,

1382
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,208
Guan Yongchao.

1383
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:19,291
There are moles
within the local police force.

1384
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:21,083
We will directly cooperate
with the immigration department

1385
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:23,416
as they have enforcement powers.
The extradition process will be faster.

1386
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,583
The four of them
were on the same flight with Pan Sheng.

1387
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:30,125
His name is Cai.

1388
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,708
He always contacted me
to book the flights.

1389
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:33,958
He has disappeared.

1390
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:38,583
The weather is killing me. It's so hot!

1391
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:42,250
Is that your key?

1392
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:44,958
No, it's not. Mine is here.

1393
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:50,625
Pass him. Don't expose yourself.

1394
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:53,041
We have obtained
two photos of the suspects.

1395
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:55,750
We are confident
that they are in the suburbs

1396
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:58,625
hiding in
an abandoned firecracker factory.

1397
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:29,083
Your delivery has arrived.

1398
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:39,375
-Don't move!
-Squat down!

1399
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:43,083
Let go!

1400
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,583
Do you know? Renting out SIM cards
for others to boost their credit.

1401
01:45:50,666 --> 01:45:52,208
-That's an illegal criminal activity.
-No, I didn't know.

1402
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:54,791
Do you know how harmful fraud
and money laundering can be?

1403
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:57,291
-No, I don't know that either.
-You don't know anything.

1404
01:45:57,375 --> 01:45:58,333
I've traveled far
and wide to catch you all.

1405
01:45:58,416 --> 01:46:00,875
We have seized
a total of 3.74 million in funds

1406
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:02,208
and 52 mobile phones.

1407
01:46:02,875 --> 01:46:03,791
Move.

1408
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:05,458
Move fast!

1409
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:09,916
These companies may be located in Canan,

1410
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,416
but the crimes occurred overseas.

1411
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:21,291
Hello.

1412
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,458
This is Akun. He handles all my business.

1413
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:26,208
Please take good care of him.

1414
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:28,000
Just call me Akun.

1415
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:30,375
It's my pleasure to cooperate with you.

1416
01:46:32,166 --> 01:46:33,541
We are one step behind.

1417
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,625
Reverse the car.

1418
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:47,500
Leave our country!

1419
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,833
Leave our country!

1420
01:47:50,916 --> 01:47:52,125
Get the fire extinguisher.

1421
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:54,125
The fire extinguisher is in the trunk.

1422
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:57,916
The fire extinguisher is in the trunk.
Hurry!

1423
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,125
Leave our country!

1424
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:04,583
Don't move.

1425
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:06,458
Stay still and hands up!

1426
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,416
Don't move!

1427
01:48:48,625 --> 01:48:49,875
Don't move!

1428
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:54,041
Stop!

1429
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:57,166
Please stop.

1430
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:00,541
Please show me some respect, okay?

1431
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:04,708
These people are my friends.

1432
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:08,166
Step out of the car and leave. Move!

1433
01:49:09,916 --> 01:49:10,750
Move!

1434
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:14,666
I heard that the police were coming.

1435
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,333
All the companies are moving out.

1436
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:18,625
When the locals have no work to do,

1437
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:20,041
they will cause trouble.

1438
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,291
I am the president of
the Overseas Chinese Business Association

1439
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:25,333
and also the landlord, so they dare not
to act aggressively towards me.

1440
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,083
There are rules here.

1441
01:49:31,166 --> 01:49:33,541
Setting off firecrackers is
equivalent to earning a profit.

1442
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:34,875
Witnessing something spectacular,

1443
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:36,333
it means making a profit of billions.

1444
01:49:37,166 --> 01:49:38,125
They are really brazen.

1445
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:39,791
The risk is smaller than drug trafficking,

1446
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:41,750
but the profits are higher.

1447
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:44,250
Can they not be aggressive?

1448
01:49:51,541 --> 01:49:53,125
Book the return tickets. Let's go back.

1449
01:49:53,875 --> 01:49:54,833
Go back now?

1450
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,125
Why did we come here?
What we have done here is just in vain?

1451
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,500
They have already provided full assistance

1452
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:02,583
and don't want to invest
more manpower and resources.

1453
01:50:02,666 --> 01:50:04,750
Let's get our people
and conduct our own investigation.

1454
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:07,583
Do you have enforcement authority?

1455
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,125
If it's not possible officially,
let's do it secretly.

1456
01:50:10,833 --> 01:50:11,916
Liang Anna has already mentioned that

1457
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,375
the suspects are in the elementary school.

1458
01:50:14,458 --> 01:50:16,875
There are over
200 elementary schools in Vanae,

1459
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:18,791
but within a radius of
30 km from Yilong Factory,

1460
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:19,875
there are only 19.

1461
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:22,291
Without a search warrant,
you won't be able to enter.

1462
01:50:23,166 --> 01:50:25,125
Our visas are expiring soon.

1463
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,750
We'll be forced to leave the country.

1464
01:50:36,916 --> 01:50:39,250
Binary is the foundation of programming.

1465
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,541
In binary, 0 equals 0,

1466
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:43,833
1 equals 1, 2 equals 10,

1467
01:50:43,916 --> 01:50:46,291
and 3 equals 11.
We covered this in the previous class.

1468
01:50:46,375 --> 01:50:48,375
So, what does four equal?

1469
01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:49,875
100.

1470
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,416
That's right.

1471
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,833
Four equals 100.

1472
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:57,083
What does five equal?

1473
01:50:57,166 --> 01:50:59,333
-Who knows the answer?
-101.

1474
01:50:59,416 --> 01:51:01,416
Are you really so smart? Correct.

1475
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,833
Try this, what does six equal?

1476
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:06,208
You're not allowed to answer.

1477
01:51:07,666 --> 01:51:08,875
Who knows the answer?

1478
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,041
What does six equal?

1479
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:14,041
I know the answer!

1480
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,166
Six…

1481
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:22,416
DON'T WORRY. MY 666…

1482
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:33,208
I'M FINE. DON'T WORRY.
THE LEASE OF MY HOUSE 666 IS UP.

1483
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,458
-Hello?
-Hello, Officer Shi.

1484
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:50,916
I have received
a message from Pan Sheng before.

1485
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,458
It seems like he wants me
to help him report to the police.

1486
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:55,000
Gao just called me

1487
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:56,916
and said that six in binary is 110,

1488
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,250
which is also a hint
for making a phone call.

1489
01:51:58,333 --> 01:52:00,833
It is definitely a clue
that Pan Sheng tried to reach out.

1490
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,333
Wait a moment.

1491
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:10,416
Moniliton Elementary School,
666 Sutarodo Avenue.

1492
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,916
Can this be for the students
at the elementary school?

1493
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,541
There are 120 deliveries,

1494
01:52:33,625 --> 01:52:35,250
all to be sent to the gymnasium.

1495
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,333
They are holding
hundreds of children as hostages.

1496
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:39,500
How do we evacuate them?

1497
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:41,666
This area belongs to Chong.

1498
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,875
Even the president has
something fishy with him.

1499
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:46,291
Even if you have access cards,
they haven't recorded your fingerprints.

1500
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,625
Liang Anna…

1501
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:51,916
She has been recorded.

1502
01:52:59,625 --> 01:53:01,916
It takes a 4-minute walk
from the main gate to the gymnasium,

1503
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,166
or a 30-second drive.

1504
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,541
If we use her fingerprint
to enter the main gate

1505
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:05,750
and it's captured by surveillance,

1506
01:53:05,833 --> 01:53:07,291
the suspects will
definitely make some moves.

1507
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:09,708
We'll have to drive in
and surround the gymnasium.

1508
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:12,625
We need to evacuate the students safely,
avoiding any crossfire.

1509
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:29,166
120 portions of boxed lunches,
and three steamed buns.

1510
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,208
Is that person
who eats steamed buns still alive?

1511
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:34,666
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

1512
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,666
Bring the owner of
this restaurant to the station,

1513
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:40,375
have some tea and work it out.

1514
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:48,500
COFFEE

1515
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,625
Catch it, slow down.

1516
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,000
Catch it.

1517
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:54,375
Go outside, hurry up.

1518
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,750
Go to the equipment room and wait for me.

1519
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:31,375
It's on fire.

1520
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,708
Are you fucking insane?

1521
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:29,166
Go to the main control room.

1522
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,166
Delete the surveillance footage.

1523
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:34,625
If Chong sees it, he won't spare you.

1524
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:44,708
I don't blame you,

1525
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:46,791
but you have to do
one thing for me for the last time.

1526
01:56:57,291 --> 01:56:58,208
Hey.

1527
01:56:59,083 --> 01:56:59,958
Smash the computers.

1528
01:57:02,375 --> 01:57:04,166
The police are here. Smash them all.

1529
01:57:24,583 --> 01:57:25,625
Saw the door open.

1530
01:57:25,708 --> 01:57:27,958
Hurry, saw it open quickly.

1531
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:48,333
You win.

1532
01:57:49,083 --> 01:57:50,625
Do me a favor, okay?

1533
01:57:52,083 --> 01:57:54,000
Take Yueting to Xuanzhou

1534
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:55,250
to her mother.

1535
01:57:55,333 --> 01:57:56,500
You should seek help from the police.

1536
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:59,125
I don't trust any of them. I trust you.

1537
01:57:59,208 --> 01:58:01,083
You can claim credit for catching me.

1538
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:03,083
Among everyone,
you'll receive the lightest punishment.

1539
01:58:03,166 --> 01:58:04,750
I might end up dead here,

1540
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:06,583
but I want her to survive.

1541
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:08,333
Here, the address.

1542
01:58:11,541 --> 01:58:14,000
Why don't you let everyone go?

1543
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,000
I need to claim credit too.

1544
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:24,625
Don't shoot.
Go in and control the situation.

1545
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:30,375
Put on the handcuffs.

1546
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:32,000
Take them away.

1547
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:57,416
Password.

1548
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:02,875
-Stop.
-Don't move.

1549
01:59:02,958 --> 01:59:04,500
Let go of the child.

1550
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:05,750
The password is on his phone.

1551
01:59:06,416 --> 01:59:08,875
It's the only terminal
that can access the server.

1552
01:59:08,958 --> 01:59:10,750
I left a backdoor when I wrote it.

1553
01:59:10,833 --> 01:59:13,791
The list of victims is in there too.
Give me the phone.

1554
01:59:16,666 --> 01:59:17,958
If you refuse to hand it over,

1555
01:59:18,541 --> 01:59:20,500
I won't fulfill my promise to you either.

1556
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,166
Don't move.

1557
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,625
We have technicians.

1558
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:37,958
I am the technician.

1559
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:39,625
Three failed attempts
to forcefully crack the password

1560
01:59:39,708 --> 01:59:41,708
will trigger server formatting.

1561
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:43,000
He's just luring you in

1562
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:45,083
and helping him destroy the evidence.

1563
01:59:49,791 --> 01:59:51,500
Don't shoot.

1564
02:00:04,458 --> 02:00:07,708
They shoot! Run!

1565
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:49,583
Pan Sheng.

1566
02:02:51,791 --> 02:02:53,291
I hope you can cooperate with the police.

1567
02:02:53,375 --> 02:02:55,708
I can help you in return.

1568
02:02:57,208 --> 02:02:59,166
Can you do me a favor?

1569
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,208
ORDERING HOTLINE

1570
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:02,541
This is her mother's address.

1571
02:03:06,041 --> 02:03:07,416
I see. I will do.

1572
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,625
Let's go.

1573
02:03:18,416 --> 02:03:20,125
The courts sentenced Lu Bingkun to death

1574
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:21,541
for multiple charges including fraud,

1575
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,750
kidnapping, and intentional homicide.

1576
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,875
For voluntarily surrendering
and showing meritorious conduct,

1577
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:31,500
Liang Anna was
sentenced to two years of imprisonment

1578
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:33,083
with a two-year probation.

1579
02:03:33,166 --> 02:03:35,666
Pan Sheng proved that his actions

1580
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:37,333
were carried out under coercion

1581
02:03:37,416 --> 02:03:40,000
and provided a list of over 2,000 victims.

1582
02:03:40,583 --> 02:03:42,625
He was not held criminally responsible.

1583
02:04:02,416 --> 02:04:03,708
I suffered a shattered left knee

1584
02:04:03,791 --> 02:04:05,208
which is classified as
level eight disabled

1585
02:04:05,791 --> 02:04:07,166
and my hands also got burned.

1586
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:08,875
I can still code,

1587
02:04:08,958 --> 02:04:10,291
albeit at a slower pace.

1588
02:04:12,041 --> 02:04:14,000
Fortunately, I am currently

1589
02:04:15,458 --> 02:04:17,208
working as a technical advisor

1590
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:20,208
at the Anti-Fraud Center
under the leadership of Zhao.

1591
02:04:20,291 --> 02:04:21,625
Telecommunications and internet fraud

1592
02:04:21,708 --> 02:04:23,750
amount to trillions of dollars annually,

1593
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:25,166
affecting millions of people.

1594
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:28,041
I hope more victims can
come forward to share their stories

1595
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:29,333
and warn others.

1596
02:04:29,416 --> 02:04:31,916
I also hope that anyone with
relevant clues can provide them.

1597
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,250
Helping others helps oneself.

1598
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:35,958
I owe my survival

1599
02:04:36,041 --> 02:04:37,708
to a particular person.

1600
02:04:42,958 --> 02:04:44,416
It's been a while since we last met.

1601
02:04:56,833 --> 02:04:57,708
Hello, everyone!

1602
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:00,250
My name is Liang Anna.

1603
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:03,458
I hope through our story,

1604
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:06,791
everyone can see clearly
what truly deserves our trust.

1605
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:17,291
BY THE END OF 2022, THE PSB UNCOVERED 1156
MILLION TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FRAUD

1606
02:05:17,375 --> 02:05:19,833
CASES, ARRESTING 1.553 MILLION SUSPECTS,
AND FREEZING MORE THAN 916.5 BILLION RMB.

1607
02:05:19,916 --> 02:05:22,125
THEY DISSUADED 93.85 MILLION POTENTIAL
VICTIMS, SAVING OVER 286.1 BILLION RMB.

1608
02:05:22,208 --> 02:05:24,125
I was traveling there.

1609
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:26,625
It wasn't through an introduction,
it was kidnapping.

1610
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:28,500
I worked as a waiter
Actually, I was in the fraud business.

1611
02:05:28,583 --> 02:05:30,291
And I said,
"I don't want to do it anymore.

1612
02:05:30,375 --> 02:05:31,791
Let me go." He said, "You can't leave.

1613
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:33,625
You've been sold."

1614
02:05:33,708 --> 02:05:36,125
He tasered me with an electric baton.
Then they handcuffed me

1615
02:05:36,208 --> 02:05:37,541
and beat me for days.

1616
02:05:37,625 --> 02:05:40,000
They just tasered me a little,
and I fell to the ground

1617
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:43,125
shaking all over, unable to move.

1618
02:05:43,208 --> 02:05:45,166
They put a gun to my head
then gave me the phone

1619
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:47,208
and asked me to call my family for money.

1620
02:05:47,291 --> 02:05:49,416
Thirty thousand dollars a finger.
They took my wrist

1621
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,416
and slashed it with a knife.

1622
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,500
It's like a prison there

1623
02:05:51,583 --> 02:05:53,583
surrounded by barbed wire.

1624
02:05:53,666 --> 02:05:56,833
They're all armed with AK-47s,
for guarding the place.

1625
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:59,833
In a place like that,
if you're not careful,

1626
02:05:59,916 --> 02:06:01,666
you could be killed.

1627
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:02,875
The more shady companies

1628
02:06:02,958 --> 02:06:05,041
will sell you to another company

1629
02:06:05,125 --> 02:06:06,958
where you'll work again,
and the cycle goes on forever.

1630
02:06:07,041 --> 02:06:09,375
If you try to escape, the result
is simple: your legs will be broken

1631
02:06:09,458 --> 02:06:10,666
and you'll be worse off than dead.

1632
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:13,416
There's no point in calling the police
because they're all in cahoots with them.

1633
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,541
There were thousands
of cell phones in the office.

1634
02:06:15,625 --> 02:06:17,416
We said that
we were trading digital currency

1635
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:19,208
and showed him we were making money.

1636
02:06:19,291 --> 02:06:21,041
In the end, it's all
about taking them with us.

1637
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:22,791
Let him make money too.

1638
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:25,208
He couldn't cash out the money he put in.

1639
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:28,041
You've been told to keep investing
for all sorts of reasons.

1640
02:06:28,125 --> 02:06:30,000
Or your money would be frozen.

1641
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:32,166
After spending all your money,
you borrow from friends,

1642
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:33,750
take out online loans, and sell the house.

1643
02:06:33,833 --> 02:06:36,125
All sorts of ways to drain you dry.

1644
02:06:36,208 --> 02:06:38,541
There's only one picture

1645
02:06:38,625 --> 02:06:39,875
of me and my oldest son.

1646
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:42,708
I've seen so many children
die so horribly.

1647
02:06:42,791 --> 02:06:45,291
They'll go looking for a job.

1648
02:06:45,375 --> 02:06:48,208
-I hope they'll keep an extra eye out.
-Don't believe in high-paying jobs.

1649
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:50,083
Those outside of the country.

1650
02:06:50,166 --> 02:06:52,250
Go to work…

1651
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:54,875
and support your wife and kids.

1652
02:06:54,958 --> 02:06:57,291
It's reassuring to know
that I'm safely back in the country.

1653
02:06:57,375 --> 02:07:00,000
In our own country
at least this won't happen.

1654
02:07:00,083 --> 02:07:03,208
When I saw
the Chinese police dressed in blue

1655
02:07:03,291 --> 02:07:06,166
coming to pick us up. I was so touched.

1656
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:07,333
When I arrived in the country,

1657
02:07:07,416 --> 02:07:09,000
I saw a sign that said,

1658
02:07:09,083 --> 02:07:10,625
"China welcomes you."

1659
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:12,791
We really wanted to cry at that moment.

1660
02:07:12,875 --> 02:07:15,166
Even though I was arrested, I'm happy.

1661
02:07:15,250 --> 02:07:17,125
I would like to thank the Chinese police

1662
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:20,083
for bringing me home safely.
