12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,640
Here.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,000
Does it really help with love?

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,799
Of course, it does.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,400
This one...

16
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,600
If you're falling for someone,

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,240
they'll surely be charmed by you.

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,160
However, you need to recite

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,520
the incantation I told you.

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Tell him.

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
He will certainly help you.

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,720
I'll try it right away.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
And...

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,040
Do you have anything else
I can try?

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Win,

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
how was the funeral?

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
Namo told me that
a ghost attacked you.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,400
Mm.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
What happened?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,440
Apart from back when I was seven,

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,960
this would be
the first time in years

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,360
since I was locked away
in a temporal prison.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
A temporal prison?

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
A temporal prison

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
is the moment when time feels like

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
seconds in the realm of the dead,

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
but hours in the realm
of the living.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
But...

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
from what I can tell,

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,960
that old man ghost
shouldn't be that strong.

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,000
The stuff about
your karmic creditor isn't over?

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
However,

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,440
there are two types of ghosts
with such an ability.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,360
The first one is a ghost
evoked by dark magic.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,400
The second one is a karmic creditor
with deep grudges.

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,080
Still...

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,440
A karmic creditor
shouldn't have that much power.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,000
Why would your karmic creditor

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,200
simply torment you?

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,160
Why wouldn't it
just kill you outright?

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
You're right.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
Perhaps it wants

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,960
to possess me
and kill my loved ones.

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,800
This is getting way worse.

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,840
Right now,

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
it'd be best if we stayed
far away from each other.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080
It should be safer this way.

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
It might be
a tough pill to swallow,

59
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
but it's the truth.

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
The truth?

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
What are you talking about?

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Tong is using dark magic.

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Nuts!

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,760
It's impossible.

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
He's my friend.

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,320
He's polite and gentle.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
He would never do such things.

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,760
That's why I told you

69
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
it's a tough pill to swallow.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
If you see
a suspicious-looking idol,

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,320
destroy it.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,720
How am I supposed to believe you?

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Gosh!

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Here.

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Keep this in case of an emergency.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Thank you.

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,000
Didn't see you at the funeral.

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,920
Why?

79
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,480
My leg got hurt quite a bit.

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
Are you on a break?

81
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Yes, I am.

82
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,320
What about the stuff
I told you to give to Win?

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,560
The stuff?

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
I totally forgot about it.

85
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Uh...

86
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't think now is the best time

87
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
to make a move on him.

88
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,920
Not the best time?

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Why?

90
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,120
He's currently going
through his bad luck year.

91
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Is that so?

92
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
Then why does he need
to be with Phloeng?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
Uh...

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
I don't know why, actually.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
This is bad.

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
The card revealed
doesn't look good.

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,720
It's going to be a tough climb
to be in a relationship.

98
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,120
Destiny aligns souls
who share equal merit, wisdom,

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
and spiritual power.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,520
Depending on who you are,

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,400
destiny will align you
with a soul of the same personality.

102
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
We don't truly get
to choose, do we?

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
It's hard to explain.

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,880
Free will is a concept
widely believed in the West.

105
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
Here in Thailand,
we believe in reincarnation.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
And what do you believe in?

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,280
I don't know.

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Whatever...
Let's go home.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's call it here.

110
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,520
Right. See you.

111
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
- I'll meet you later.
- It's so fcking hot here.

112
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
- Okay. See you.
- Why are we sitting here?

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Hey!

114
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
Take it easy.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
If you jump,

116
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,920
you'll be reborn and die again
until your time is up.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
How about this?

118
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
I'll do a card reading for you

119
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,320
so that you'll see what you can do.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
I believe that
you'll get through this.

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You may have had
bad experiences in the past,

122
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
but deep down,
you're a good person.

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,920
You can change
a lot of things for the better.

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,880
I told you that I'm new to this.

125
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
The reading even reveals that

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
you'll become famous
and well-known,

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,920
get to help others,

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,880
and own something big.

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
So...

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
Don't cut your life short.

131
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Right.

132
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,559
Hello, guys.

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,720
You're back with Win, the seer.

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,360
Tell me if you want to have me
do a reading about something.

135
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,159
It can be love,

136
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,879
education, finance, or work.

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
Feel free to submit your requests.

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Oh!

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,720
Hello, Tachang.

140
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Thank you for sticking around
since I started livestreaming.

141
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,360
Tell me if you want me
to do another reading.

142
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
(Tul: It's okay.
(Take it easy, Master)

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Well...

144
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll be seeing you.

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Tong.

146
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Hm?

147
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,360
I think I'm going to take
a step further with Win.

148
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
You're really going to date him?

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mm.

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,240
That's good.

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,400
Try hosting a show
outside the city.

152
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
Not only will you get
to hang out outdoors,

153
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
but you'll also get
to go on a date with him.

154
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Sounds good?

155
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Mm...

156
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
What kind of show?

157
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,640
A ghost-hunting show.

158
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,320
You sure it's a good idea?

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It is.

160
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,200
His sense is more powerful
than you think.

161
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
Tarot card reading

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,800
is nothing but his toy.

163
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,920
Really?

164
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm going to bring this up
in the board meeting.

165
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,400
What the hell?

166
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,160
May the Goddess of Earth,

167
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
the Goddess of Water,

168
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,560
all divine beings,
guardian spirits,

169
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,400
and sacred entities

170
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,160
protect all living creatures

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
and turn any misfortune
that comes my way

172
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
into good fortune.

173
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,560
Doing merit release again?

174
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,920
Oh, Phloeng?

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,080
We meet again.

176
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,399
Did you put a tracking device

177
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
on me or something?

178
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,360
You're speaking nonsense again.

179
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,319
Throughout life,

180
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,559
having bad luck in itself

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,880
is already horrible.

182
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,400
But when those with special senses

183
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
are having bad luck,

184
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
the degree of misfortune
is doubled.

185
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Venerable Father

186
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,240
is very serious
about my bad luck year.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Then what?

188
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
That's that.

189
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Lately, I've been seeing
weird things.

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,920
If you stare at me a bit longer,

191
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
I'll take it
as you having a crush on me.

192
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,880
That's not the case.

193
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Gosh.

194
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
What a shame.

195
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,880
I don't have
romantic feelings for you.

196
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,840
It's just that I feel safe
when you're around.

197
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Safe? How so?

198
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,160
In this world,

199
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,720
you're the only person

200
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,680
who can help me deal
with my bad luck year.

201
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Really?

202
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,600
See?

203
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,520
You don't believe me anyway.

204
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,599
Well...

205
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
It feels like
a love confession scene in a series.

206
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,200
Just admit that
you have a crush on me.

207
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
Lying in front of a Buddha image
is bad, you know?

208
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,600
It's whatever at this point.

209
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Hi, Master.

210
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Are you tired today?

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,520
A little bit.

212
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Are you still good?

213
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Yes.

214
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,920
Have you received the gift
I told Tong to give to you?

215
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
The gift?

216
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
What is it?

217
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
That's okay.

218
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm not going
to beat around the bush.

219
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Huh?

220
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,400
Well...

221
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,160
I want to get to know you better.

222
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,840
Get to know me?

223
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
We already know each other.

224
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Like dating.

225
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Master.

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's go home.

227
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Let's go.

228
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Wait...

229
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,680
I can go home by myself.

230
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
- Didn't you say I'm...
- Wait!

231
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,080
I'll go home with you, I guess.

232
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Have a good one, Tul.

233
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,520
This abandoned house
will be our filming location.

234
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,280
Is it really safe?

235
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Yes, it's 100% safe.

236
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,400
There aren't any ghosts, I think.

237
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
How would there be any?

238
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
Maybe there are. Who knows?

239
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
Would this type of show
be too similar to someone else's?

240
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,440
How would that be?

241
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,600
We've got Master Win
as the star of the show.

242
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,359
If he's on our show,

243
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,440
imagine what it'll be like.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,560
You guys still in the meeting?

245
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,720
It's done.

246
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,201
What's left is
tomorrow's run-through.

247
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,920
Go and rest up.

248
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,600
Okay, let's go, guys.

249
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Have you packed up your stuff?

250
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Packed up my stuff?

251
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
We're leaving the city tomorrow.

252
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh.

253
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,960
It won't take long.

254
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,560
I don't have many clothes.

255
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Right.

256
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,400
What did Tul say to you?

257
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,360
Uh...

258
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,960
Oh,

259
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,400
Namo and Tong are sharing
the bedroom with me tomorrow,

260
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,200
so I won't be bothering
you like last time.

261
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Right.

262
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Phloeng.

263
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
What is it?

264
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,680
If...

265
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,119
If something bad
were to happen to me

266
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
- on this trip...
- I don't believe it.

267
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Come on.

268
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,839
Can't you just go along?

269
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,320
It's just a hypothetical scenario.

270
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,279
I said that

271
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,200
because I won't let it happen.

272
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
It's getting late.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,920
Get some rest, Master.
You need to be up early.

274
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
If...

275
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,440
If I were to change my mind
and not go tomorrow,

276
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,800
would it look bad?

277
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Very much so.

278
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Well then...

279
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
Thank you very much
for driving me home.

280
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,799
Have a safe trip home,

281
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,440
and I'll see you tomorrow.

282
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Right.

283
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Here, Win.

284
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,639
Venerable Father
had me return this to you.

285
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
You dropped it back at the temple.

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Right.

287
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,200
Thank you so much.

288
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Mm.

289
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Good heavens...

290
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Hey...

291
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,919
Should we ask Venerable Father

292
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
if we can bring
a Buddha image with us?

293
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,520
The Tower...

294
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,280
It always spells disaster.

295
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Yeah.

296
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,800
You also drew the card
in your third year.

297
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Yeah.

298
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,560
That time, I fell over

299
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
and broke my arm.

300
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
I had to wear a cast for months.

301
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,400
Yeah, I remember that.

302
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
Recently, luck hasn't been
on my side either.

303
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,720
This time, it's not just The Tower.

304
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
It's accompanied by The Devil

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
and the Nine of Swords.

306
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
This means that my mental state

307
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,320
will be in jeopardy.

308
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,800
What should we do?

309
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,120
Should I call them
and cancel the project?

310
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,600
They're going
to be furious, though.

311
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
How about this?

312
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,280
Here!

313
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
The ultimate measure.

314
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,599
You'll be able
to get through this just fine,

315
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
right?

316
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Yeah.

317
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,240
I've exorcised all kinds of ghosts.

318
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
This is just a karmic creditor.

319
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,719
I'll be able
to deal with it, right?

320
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Yeah.

321
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You've got this.

322
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Tong,

323
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,360
has there been
anything strange happening?

324
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
No, there hasn't.

325
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,440
Everything seems normal.

326
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
By the way,

327
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,759
what is that?

328
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
It's on the table.

329
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
This box?

330
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,240
Tul sent this over to you.

331
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,680
What is it, Tong?

332
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I don't know.

333
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
A prop, I guess.

334
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,800
This is absolutely horrifying.

335
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,320
Are we talking about ghost stories
or performing a ritual?

336
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah, what the hell?

337
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
This is weird.

338
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,760
This is freaky.

339
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Maybe it's just a prop.

340
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Alright.

341
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,959
Tong, make some room.

342
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,640
- This can't fit.
- No, just jam it inside.

343
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,799
- It's going to fit.
- It's not.

344
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
- It's going to break.
- Gosh!

345
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,280
Can you stop focusing on stuffing
a sacred object into the bag?

346
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,640
You will never get it, will you?

347
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,920
I drew The Tower,
The Devil,

348
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:00,080
and the Nine of Swords.

349
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,199
But you said that

350
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,480
Phloeng has some kind of power
that can protect you.

351
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,720
This is just for good measure.

352
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,720
Get it? Good measure?

353
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,520
We don't know
what's going to happen.

354
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,560
Yeah.

355
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:15,801
On top of that, he and I
are staying in a different room.

356
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,880
What if a ghost
attacks me at night?

357
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Fine.

358
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,840
Should I ask them
to make changes to the bedrooms,

359
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,799
as you want to share
a bedroom with Phloeng?

360
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,280
Okay?

361
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,119
Hey, don't you dare ask them that.

362
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,840
Do it.

363
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,879
- So you'll be safe from ghosts.
- Go for it.

364
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll ask them, okay?

365
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,960
No, don't.

366
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
Are they here?

367
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Right?

368
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,120
- Maybe that's them.
- Right?

369
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,880
This way.

370
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Thank you.

371
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Okay.

372
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,680
Master, come with me.

373
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
No, come with me.

374
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,680
Win.

375
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,320
On this trip, you're done for.

376
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
Fcking hell!

377
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,880
No wonder you can't see ghosts.

378
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,160
Why are you rubbing it in?

379
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Win,

380
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,160
are you sharing the van with Tul?

381
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,960
Uh...

382
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Come and join me.

383
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,280
If anything happens,
my radiant thingy will protect you.

384
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,319
How about this?

385
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,400
Let me sort it out for you.

386
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,320
Tong is going to be
in the same van as Tul.

387
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,800
As for Win,
you're going with Phloeng.

388
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,120
As for me, I'm coming with...

389
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,960
you, Tong.

390
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Let's go, Win.

391
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Welcome, everybody.

392
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm Pong,

393
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,240
the manager of this pool villa.

394
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Since our housing project
is currently under construction,

395
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,799
only one unit is available,

396
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
and that being Nokphaeng's.

397
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,080
However, rest assured,

398
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
as for a few days,

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,160
I have put the construction on hold

400
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
to avoid any disturbances.

401
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,880
Also, the only guests here
are the 'Spooky Hellish Night' crew.

402
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,800
With that said,
feel free to go inside.

403
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,160
Thank you.
Let's go.

404
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Win.

405
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
Tomorrow is a Buddhist holy day.

406
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
Are you going to be fine?

407
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll be fine, Tong.

408
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Okay.

409
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Alright, let's pick our bedrooms.

410
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,520
How's your bedroom?

411
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,720
You scared me, Tul.

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,240
My apologies, Master.

413
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I've seen the stuff you sent me.

414
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Thank you.

415
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,320
Right.
And...

416
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,920
When do you want me to use it?

417
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,080
When to use it?

418
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
What do you mean by that?

419
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Well,

420
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm talking about the stuff
you sent me for a ritual.

421
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,280
Huh?

422
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,640
That wasn't what I sent you.

423
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Oh...

424
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
But...

425
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,560
I also want to talk
to you about something.

426
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
It's the topic that got cut short.

427
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Right.

428
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,440
Do I still have a chance?

429
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,840
Please don't, Tul.

430
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,200
Currently, my close ones

431
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,000
are dying.

432
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,680
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

433
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Right.

434
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,920
Is it because of Phloeng?

435
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
No, it's not.

436
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I mean it.

437
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,920
There's still so much more
you don't know.

438
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,440
Can you help me
get the full picture?

439
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,440
You're making me
feel uncomfortable.

440
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,680
I don't know it either,

441
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,200
but I need to clear
something up with my friend.

442
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,240
Master,

443
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,599
we're shooting
the first EP tonight.

444
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,920
Let's discuss the schedule.

445
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Sure.

446
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
This way.

447
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Job?

448
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Are you good?

449
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Mm.

450
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I'm good.

451
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,840
Just a little headache.

452
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,399
You should rest up first.

453
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,600
When it's time for the meeting,
I'll come and get you.

454
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Let's go.

455
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Rest well.

456
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Everyone's here, right?

457
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
One, two, three, four,

458
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,600
five, six, seven...

459
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,080
What about Job?

460
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,920
He was the first
to come downstairs, though.

461
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,640
Well, where is he?
Call him.

462
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,560
He's not answering the phone.

463
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,280
That's fine.

464
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,616
We'll start the meeting
without him.

465
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,200
He can manage
the schedule on his own.

466
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
There as well.

467
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Guys...

468
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,560
How's everything, Ple?

469
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I can't find him.

470
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,400
Pong said nobody had wandered off
toward the main office.

471
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,399
Moreover, the guests staying here

472
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,960
are just our team, right?

473
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,240
If one of us were
to wander outside,

474
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,560
either the workers or the staff
should be able to spot them.

475
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,280
Where the hell is he?

476
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
Then we'll wait for another hour.

477
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,920
Then we'll look for him
if he doesn't return.

478
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Hey,

479
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
is Job dead?

480
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Dmn it, Namo!

481
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Why the hell did you say that?

482
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,520
I was kidding.

483
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,440
Maybe he went
to a convenience store

484
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,880
and got stuck there
due to the rain.

485
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,080
You're the only one here
who sees it that way.

486
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,760
Is that a compliment or a jab?

487
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Be clear about it.

488
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Hey!

489
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,400
He sent me a message.

490
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,120
Let me see it.
What does it say?

491
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,360
This is the message he sent:

492
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
"Help me."

493
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Help me?

494
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,680
What does he mean by that?

495
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,520
Hey...

496
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,040
Let me check where he sent it.

497
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,440
Do it as quickly as you can.

498
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,799
Sht...

499
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
Why is that the location?

500
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,440
Try checking it again.

501
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
No, listen.

502
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,440
It always ends up here.

503
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,440
Pong, is this location
in the woods?

504
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,840
It is.

505
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:40,121
It's in the middle of the woods.

506
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,320
Perhaps,

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,640
he was sleepwalking.

508
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,439
He said he wanted a quick nap.

509
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,799
I then went out
to shoot some footage outside.

510
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,520
I remember that he tends
to sleepwalk a lot at night.

511
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
He sleepwalked into the woods?

512
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
My head hurts.

513
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,520
What should we do, Nokphaeng?

514
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,680
We probably need to look for him.

515
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,360
Do you have any flashlights?

516
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
We do.

517
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
- Can you please fetch them for us?
- No problem.

518
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,360
Check the location one more time.

519
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,480
What should the question be?

520
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
"Will Job make it out alive?"

521
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,440
That's such a terrible question.

522
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,200
Uh...

523
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,560
I've changed my mind...

524
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,080
"Will we be able to find Job?"

525
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
What do they mean?

526
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,320
I don't know.

527
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
What?

528
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,120
Try to focus.

529
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,440
Well then...

530
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,439
Look at the cards one at a time.

531
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,120
The first one is The Devil.

532
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,920
What does it mean?

533
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,160
In this context,

534
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,360
it symbolizes fixation.

535
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,280
See the card illustration?

536
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,920
There are two people

537
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,720
being chained.

538
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,600
Then there's the devil
between them.

539
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,800
What about the Three of Pentacles?

540
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,680
The Three of Pentacles?

541
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,240
A Pentacle symbolizes work.

542
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,576
The Three of Pentacles symbolizes

543
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,920
a negotiation between three people.

544
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,720
It also means trust.

545
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,920
What about the Seven of Cups?

546
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
The illustration is

547
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,640
a man looking at floating cups.

548
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,120
The positive meanings
are having plans,

549
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
a bright future,

550
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
and dreams.

551
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,080
As for the negatives...

552
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
They're daydreaming,

553
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
being unrealistic,

554
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
and procrastinating.

555
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Combine these meanings
with the question

556
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,800
of how he's doing...

557
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
Use your sense.

558
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
It's raining.

559
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,520
My sensing power
is useless right now.

560
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,760
What about Toh?

561
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,840
I can't see him.

562
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,400
Maybe he's not here with us.

563
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
Is Job being abducted by a ghost?

564
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,280
Watch what you're saying, Namo!

565
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
Come on, Win!

566
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,960
We're in the middle of nowhere.

567
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,200
Also, Job sleepwalks a lot.

568
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,200
It's just like a scenario
in a horror film.

569
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,680
If you're not stopping,

570
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,360
I'm going to send you flying.

571
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
What?

572
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What I said was true.

573
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,680
Tul, are you alright?

574
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,560
Of course, I'm not.

575
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,360
A crew member has gone missing.

576
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,680
Is it because of that

577
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,800
or because of Win?

578
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,200
Why are you stirring the pot?

579
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,440
Am I? Huh?

580
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,640
I told you that
he doesn't want to date you.

581
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Why?

582
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,640
You want to cut me off from Win?

583
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
What are you saying?

584
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,680
You know it well.

585
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,160
Gosh...

586
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,280
What's wrong?

587
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Nothing.

588
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,680
I can't sense anything.

589
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Oh?

590
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,760
Nokphaeng is calling!

591
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Really?!

592
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,960
How is it going?

593
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,160
Job entered an abandoned house.

594
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Huh?!

595
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
An abandoned house?

596
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,120
When Nokphaeng and the crew
entered the house,

597
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,040
they saw him sitting in a daze.

598
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,360
He's remained unresponsive.

599
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,560
Can you go there and check him out?

600
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Why aren't they taking him out?

601
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,960
Getting him hospitalized
should be easier.

602
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,240
What?!

603
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,880
Suddenly, Job is screaming, Master!

604
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,080
Nobody can overpower him.

605
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
When they tried to pick him up,
he became as heavy as a rock.

606
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,800
Is Phloeng there in the house?

607
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,960
Phloeng and his crew
are picking up doctors.

608
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,040
They're probably
joining them later.

609
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Tell Phloeng to go there
as quickly as possible.

610
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Where's the abandoned house?

611
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,960
Here it is.

612
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,120
What's going on, you guys?

613
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,200
Are there ghosts on this property?

614
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Hurry.

615
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Namo,

616
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,680
can you stop looking
excited for a second?

617
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,920
Come on! Win, my friend!

618
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,920
This is my first time
seeing someone get possessed!

619
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I've never seen one in my life.

620
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,679
Are you insane?

621
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
What?

622
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Tong...

623
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,880
Be honest.

624
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
What are you trying to do?

625
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
Do what?

626
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
About Tul.

627
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm not trying to do anything.

628
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,520
Even though I can't sense it,
I know it.

629
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
We're here.

630
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,920
Where's Job?

631
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,920
He's on the second floor.

632
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
He's with Nokphaeng and the crew.

633
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Right.

634
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,080
What is it, Win?

635
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,960
A murder occurred in this house.

636
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,600
Is there a presence of dark magic?

637
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm not sure.

638
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,840
Should we head back?

639
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
This is doable.

640
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,320
We've got people here.

641
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,680
When there are a lot of people,
the supernatural won't dare harm us.

642
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Namo,

643
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
where's the necklace?

644
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,040
It's ready to go.

645
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,240
I have to put it on Job, right?

646
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Mm.

647
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Let's go.

648
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
- Let's go.
- To the second floor.

649
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Namo...

650
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,480
This is spooky.

651
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
I'm getting the chills, too.

652
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,080
Tong, are you with us?

653
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,920
Yes, I am.

654
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,200
Look at the picture.

655
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,880
It's creeping me out.

656
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Is it this room?

657
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
Try opening the door.

658
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,400
It's not budging.

659
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,720
Maybe it's this room?

660
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm seeing nobody.

661
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Yeah.

662
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,160
Can you ask Ple?

663
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Right, right.

664
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm seeing nobody in any room.

665
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,560
What?

666
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,720
Ple hasn't been following us, Win.

667
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Right?

668
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,320
Where did he go?

669
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
What?

670
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Huh?!

671
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,720
Namo!

672
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Tong!

673
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Hey!

674
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Hey!

675
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,000
Tong, open the door!

676
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Tong!

677
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,080
Unlock the door!

678
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,840
Namo!

679
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,880
Depression,

680
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
anger,

681
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,800
sorrow, and anguish...

682
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,360
Hey!

683
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:05,400
Let me out!

684
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,120
Let me the fck out!

685
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,680
Or else I'll curse you!

686
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Namo!

687
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,120
Do you believe in ghosts?

688
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,440
You tricked both Win

689
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,400
and me.

690
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,560
Just what do you want?

691
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,360
No matter what I say,

692
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,760
you still won't love me.

693
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,320
Are you ready?

694
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,520
I'm fcking ready!

695
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,280
Hey! What is Win doing?!

696
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Master!

697
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,040
Let go!

698
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,240
It wants to take Win's life.

699
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,840
A person or not,

700
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,440
its power is immense.

701
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,640
Someone is behind this?

702
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,480
If I were to die tomorrow...

703
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,400
I've never kissed anyone before.

704
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,880
Is it the work
of destiny or fate?

705
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,200
I have no choice but to accept it

706
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,960
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

707
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,720
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

708
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,120
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

709
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
