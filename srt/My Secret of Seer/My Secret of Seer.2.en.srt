20

I'm Phloengnathitorn.

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
We're joined by Jaab,
the person behind this EP's story.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,856
To make it even more special,

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,360
this EP's also featuring
the White Knight Seer,

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,040
a clairvoyance expert.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Hello, Master.
Hello, Jaab.

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,960
Why is this room full of the scent of summer?

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,080
My senses are completely clouded...

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
Jaab,

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,200
I heard you've had an experience with a curse.
Is that correct?

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,360
That's right. I was cursed,

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
and I think that I still am.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
And...

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,320
What's the story?

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,600
Do you mind sharing it with us?

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Well, I'm superstitious.

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,200
It all started
when I broke up with my boyfriend.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,160
I wanted him to come back to me,

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
so I turned to the paranormal.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,480
This generation
is into such things, aren't they?

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
So where did you go for that?

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Horrorscope.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Sorry?

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,880
It's the name of the place.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,600
It's a shop offering good luck wallpapers.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,760
Are you alright, Master?

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
No, it was nothing.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,080
So, what is it with Horrorscope?

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,720
They let me choose
aspects of my luck to enhance.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,600
There's career, finance, and love.

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,160
So I chose love,

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
since I'd like him to come back to me.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,840
- I really love him.
- Right.

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,080
Why Horrorscope?

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,240
I mean, there are several of
these shops out there on social media.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,120
Is there a specific reason
you chose this place?

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,680
I love the slogan:

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,040
"Visit Horrorscope

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,280
and your life will be horrible no more."

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Master?

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
It's nothing.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
Does this mean their fortune reading
is very accurate?

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,280
It's 99%, Phloeng!

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,840
The reading is 99% accurate?

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,320
99% comes from my own actions,

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,480
and 1% from the wallpaper.

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Master?

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,360
You don't look so well.

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,480
Is it because of Jaab?

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Oh, it's not.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Please continue.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
So, two months ago,

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,040
my boyfriend started acting strange.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,600
He came home late,

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
always dodged my questions,

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
and always stayed in the bedroom.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,080
He would wake up
in the middle of every night

78
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,160
and stare at the window.

79
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Babe?

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Are you alright?

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,480
Still, he wasn't the same.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,000
On some nights, he'd get on top of me,

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
and just stay still!

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
It was so terrifying.

85
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,040
It was as if he were cursed.

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,240
Huh? Babe?

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
What are you doing?!

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Babe!

89
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,800
A new scent?

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
What does this mean?

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Do you think
his boyfriend has also been cursed?

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,480
Maybe that wallpaper works
the same way as a philter.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
It's possible.

94
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
From my own experiences

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,720
with those charmed by a spell,

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
they all look unwell, just like him.

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,840
Now, it's your turn, Master.

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Yes?

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Oh.

100
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Then...
Please select three cards from the deck

101
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
with your non-dominant hand.

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
Regarding your question...

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,800
The Major Arcana I picked is
accompanied by two Minor Arcana,

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,760
Five of Pentacles and Two of Pentacles.

105
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
The Major Arcana is the Devil.

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Usually, the Pentacles cards resemble wealth.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,160
It can also be interpreted as prosperity

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
and physical well-being.

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
When the Pentacles cards
appear with the Devil...

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,520
What does it mean, Master?

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes, what does it mean?

112
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
What's Jaab's fortune like?

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
I cannot interpret them...

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
What?

115
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
So...

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,680
Has your boyfriend given you
any suspicious drinks lately?

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,800
For one, he's brewed me tea.

118
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,040
He said he got it from India.

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
Master, don't tell me that...

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,640
Do you go to bed before him

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,320
or after him?

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
I always sleep before him.

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
And...

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640
How's your finance?

125
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
Any irregularities with your finances?

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes, I've been spending a lot of money.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,320
I've been getting all the supplies
for our room myself.

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
He used to help me with this,

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,480
but not anymore.

130
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,880
Moreover, I feel like
I'm constantly bleeding money.

131
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
I don't know why that's the case either.

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
I don't know...

133
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
What the hell?

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,560
How do I get back?

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,640
You can't.

136
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
Who are you?

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm the one in your vision, honey.

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,560
Win...

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Wongsawat!

140
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,360
Master!

141
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,520
Are you alright?

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Is it a ghost?

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
Phloeng?

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
What just happened?

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,720
Please give me a moment.

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Jaab,

147
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,440
do you have any valuable possessions,

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
like a family ring,

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,400
passed down from your grandfather?

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
I do. My mother gave me something.

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,720
However, I don't wear it.

152
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
I'd keep it in my pocket instead.

153
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
It's a family heirloom that belonged to
my great-great-grandmother.

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,400
It must be a priceless item, then.

155
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,480
Do you mind if I have a look?

156
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
It's actually worth
a few hundred thousand baht.

157
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
I must've forgotten to bring it with me today.

158
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,000
If possible,

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
please hurry and find it.

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Why?

161
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,400
Is his bracelet the key to easing his troubles?

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
It's not related to a curse at all.

163
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Huh?

164
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,480
Jaab,

165
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,120
can you please check your bank account?

166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Why, Master?

167
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Please do it.

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
What?!

169
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
What's the problem?

170
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Is it a ghost?

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,640
There's nothing left in my bank account!

172
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Huh?

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,440
It's empty!

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,840
Pull yourself together, Jaab.

175
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
Think carefully,

176
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,480
if you've spent it on something

177
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,720
or transferred the money
to any other bank accounts.

178
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
No, I never use this account ever!

179
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never taken any money out of it.

180
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
It's my hands-off bank account.

181
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
And...

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,120
Can anybody else access this bank account?

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
No.

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,840
I've never used this bank account,

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,896
and I've never once
transferred the money from it.

186
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,320
It's completely inaccessible!

187
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
And...

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,800
Is there anyone else
you think can access this account?

189
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
Aside from me,

190
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
it's probably my boyfriend.

191
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,160
Okay, then it's clear.

192
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
You weren't cursed.

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,160
But scammed.

194
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,320
Let's go, Yok.

195
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,760
Follow me.

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,280
You're still here?

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
What's this?

198
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,640
The Radiance of the Seven Gems?

199
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,480
It's the light of a highly virtuous person.

200
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,000
That would explain

201
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,400
why no ghosts could enter the building.

202
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Master?

203
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,600
Are you staring at my chest?

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
A highly virtuous soul...

205
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
You're that dazzled by my chest?

206
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
No, I wasn't staring.

207
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,120
I've brought Yok over to you.

208
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
He said he was looking for his father.

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
It's also getting late,

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,160
so I thought it'd be best
to bring him back to you.

211
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Yok?

212
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Yes, Yok.

213
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
What?

214
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Where did he go?

215
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,440
He mustn't have gone far.

216
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm going to look for him.

217
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
I don't have a child, though.

218
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
So...

219
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,520
Is there anybody else here named Phloeng?

220
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
Yok said 'Phloeng'
was the name of his father.

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm the only Phloeng here.

222
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Then, does anybody else here
have a son named Yok?

223
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,000
He's about 5 years old

224
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
and is this tall.

225
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm a ghost radio host,

226
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
not a registrar.

227
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
I was being polite with my question.

228
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
So was I with my answer.

229
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,880
With your answer?

230
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
You were messing with me.

231
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,040
It's already late.

232
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Go home and rest

233
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
so that you grow up.

234
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Phloeng.

235
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
How dare you call me short?

236
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,640
I didn't say that.

237
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,320
You told me to grow up.

238
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm already 26.

239
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,560
And this is as tall as I can get.

240
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Sure.

241
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
"Sure?"

242
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm definitely leaving.

243
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,040
Just remember this.
A child ghost is following you.

244
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,560
He looks exactly like you.

245
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,520
And said he was looking for his father.

246
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,640
That could be your past karma.
You'd better be careful.

247
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I'm a fortune teller.

248
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,800
I can be scared, too, can't I?

249
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Right.

250
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,720
Thanks for worrying about me.

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
Unfortunately, I don't believe in ghosts.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,720
You don't believe in ghosts,

253
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
but you're a ghost show host?

254
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Yes, so what?

255
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,960
Wouldn't you need to
have a passion for ghosts?

256
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
It's nonsense.

257
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
Ghosts aren't real.

258
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,960
I just love listening to
the yapping nonsense from people like you.

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
It's entertaining. Don't you think?

260
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,640
Yapping nonsense?

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
You can't see what I see in my world.

262
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
What would you know?

263
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
Well...

264
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
Next time, show me what it looks like.

265
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,720
Who the hell do you think you are?

266
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
Dare to take a guess?

267
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
What's wrong?

268
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,840
How long was I out for?

269
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
- 5 minutes.
- Only 5 minutes?

270
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,720
You've seriously been this restless?

271
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,640
Look at this. Is this a ghost show
or a comedy show?

272
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Hey.

273
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,960
I think Phloeng must've gotten
a girl pregnant.

274
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
The boy named Yok you told us about...

275
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,800
What did he look like?

276
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,400
Did he look... complete?

277
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,440
He did.

278
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,240
He looked just like a normal boy.

279
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,280
No wounds, no distorted parts.

280
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,920
Ghosts these days are weird.

281
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
But the only thing is that...

282
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,760
The boy's father is insufferable.

283
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,360
Maybe he needs your help.

284
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
This again.

285
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,240
A divine duty I didn't ask for.

286
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,520
How about this?

287
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
Go and talk to his father.

288
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,800
Tell him that he's got a son.

289
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
Even though he's dead,

290
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,600
he wants his father to acknowledge
his past existence.

291
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,200
I also believe that
the boy's mother had an abortion.

292
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,000
That's why her son
has been going after his father, for justice.

293
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,000
You're going wild with your theory,

294
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,440
while I simply met Yok's ghost.

295
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,760
Come on, Win!

296
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,160
What would you know?

297
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,280
Phloengnathitorn is a massive player.

298
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,040
See, despite his damn poor fashion taste,

299
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,520
he's goddamn handsome!

300
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,000
Imagine him dressing up properly.

301
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,600
I bet girls would be all over him.

302
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
So what?

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,840
It'd be nothing strange
if he's gotten a girl pregnant, though,

304
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,880
especially since you said that
Yok looked just like him.

305
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Whatever it is,

306
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm done doing business with the guy.

307
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,080
Right, right.

308
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,880
Then... I'm off to my divine duty.

309
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,800
Wait. Where are you going?

310
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,080
The cat will stay in the bag.

311
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
See you.

312
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,680
- Bye-bye.
- You...

313
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
Right. See you.

314
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Catch you later.

315
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,480
Oh, by the way,

316
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,440
we're out of stock.

317
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,696
Could you fetch the items
from the Venerable Father?

318
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,880
I'll text him you're going.

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you.

320
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
No problem.

321
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
What the heck?

322
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,400
Hold on, Win.

323
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Should we come later?

324
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,600
This place looks scary.

325
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,880
Then why are you following me here?

326
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
It gets too lonely!

327
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,960
I don't have anybody else to talk to.

328
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,800
Just be careful, Toh.

329
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
You're gonna get bullied by the local spirits.

330
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,520
One of them could be
that speed demon relative of yours.

331
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
You're right...

332
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
Damn it.

333
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm dead, and I'm still getting bullied?

334
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,320
Give me a break!

335
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Hey, Tohmorn Rabbit?

336
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,240
What if you take off your mask

337
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
and scare the ghosts yourself?

338
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
No. It doesn't sound badass.

339
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Win, please take care of yourself.

340
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,440
I can sense my rival gang in there.

341
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
I'll... be seeing you!

342
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,920
Good to see you, Venerable Father.

343
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Oh, Win!

344
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,120
Who else did you bring here?

345
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,960
They're following you like an entourage.

346
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
Huh?

347
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
Please don't tease me like that.

348
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,920
Has the business been doing well?

349
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,640
It's been decent.

350
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
If I had posted content on TikTok,

351
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
it would've been way better.

352
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,520
But I'm not a great speaker.

353
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,320
I'm lucky
I've got Namo and Tong with me.

354
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,600
Tell me. How old are you this year?

355
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I...

356
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,920
I just turned 26 last month.

357
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,480
Do you know
it's your critical year of life transition?

358
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,880
But... I've looked it up on the Internet,

359
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,160
and it says that it happens at 25.

360
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,760
That means I've made it, haven't I?

361
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,640
It's different for everyone.

362
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,880
For you, it's this year, at the age of 26.

363
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,800
You need to seek help
from a highly virtuous individual.

364
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,800
- A highly virtuous individual?
- Yes.

365
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,280
Is the year gonna be fatal for me, then?

366
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,920
This time, it certainly is.

367
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,040
Father...

368
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,840
Please don't scare me like that.

369
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,720
You told me that
you had recurring, bizarre dreams.

370
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Has that gone away?

371
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,440
No, it hasn't.

372
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,200
What should I do?

373
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
I don't want to die.

374
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,520
Should I get ordained again?

375
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
I'll do it for a year this time.

376
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Mm...

377
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
That might help.

378
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
But not enough.

379
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,200
This time, you're in grave danger.

380
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,560
What am I supposed to do, Father?

381
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,360
Are you seriously going to let me die?

382
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,840
Keep yourself accompanied
by a highly virtuous individual.

383
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,960
You may have already found one, I believe.

384
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,480
You are watching Spooky Hellish Night,

385
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,880
a fiery night haunted
by horrors of the unknown.

386
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm Phloengnathitorn.

387
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,440
We're joined by Jaab,
the person behind the story of this EP.

388
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,456
To make this an even more special one,

389
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,800
this EP's also featuring
the White Knight Seer,

390
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
a clairvoyance expert.

391
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,280
Hello, Master.
Hello, Jaab.

392
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Hello.

393
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,920
Jaab,

394
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,376
I heard you've had an experience with a curse.
Is that correct?

395
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,040
- You enjoy ghost content?
- That's right.

396
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,680
I was cursed,

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,080
and I think that I still am.

398
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
And...

399
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Are you scared?

400
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm not.

401
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
If it's alright with you,

402
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,720
can we be FWBs?

403
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,240
How about we finish
what we've started first?

404
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,000
These are from the new batch.

405
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Feel free to take them.

406
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Okay.

407
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Whoa.

408
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,520
At this rate, even the guardian spirits
can't come in.

409
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,880
Yeah, let's give this a try.

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,200
Good luck coming in.

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,040
Win!

412
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,400
No wonder it burns!

413
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,920
Who put those talismans on the door?

414
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,920
It won't be long, Toh.

415
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,120
Gosh...

416
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm almost done putting them on.

417
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Whoa!

418
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,720
Why aren't you wearing pants?

419
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,680
Put them on ASAP.

420
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,120
Or I'll make it burn even more.

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,080
Okay. Fine.

422
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm putting them on.

423
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
Hold on...

424
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,520
Was that Toh's ghost?

425
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,800
Yeah.

426
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,880
I offered him pants,
but he wouldn't put them on.

427
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
Now he's walking around with it all out.

428
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
He still refuses to stop flirting with you?

429
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
He's got over it.

430
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,120
But, about my karmic creditor,

431
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
what should I do?

432
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
You don't even know who they are?

433
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,760
I have no idea.

434
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,520
Have you tried tarot reading?

435
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,960
Perhaps the cards can show you
what they want.

436
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,200
Tarot cards,

437
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,640
can you reveal to me

438
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,080
who is my karmic creditor,
that the Venerable Father told me about?

439
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
What the heck?

440
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
What happened?

441
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,840
It's confusing.

442
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,520
Don't these cards say that
your karmic creditor is

443
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,080
a wealthy lady who died because of you?

444
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,800
That's not how you read the cards...

445
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,760
I have no clue.

446
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,800
Are you ready?!

447
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,200
Are you ready?!

448
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
Win!

449
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,400
Win!

450
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
Here, Win!

451
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,000
Here!

452
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,960
Are you alright?

453
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm fine.

454
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,200
You suddenly tried to choke yourself.

455
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,400
It was just like...

456
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
what happened at the studio.

457
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,880
Is your karmic creditor this powerful?

458
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,720
Maybe.

459
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,200
Or...

460
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,320
Am I actually going to die, Tong?

461
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,560
Don't say that.

462
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,440
You'll make it.

463
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,280
You told me you want to help those in need.

464
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
You're right.

465
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,520
Why don't you fight
your karmic creditor instead?

466
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
You're right...

467
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,760
Maybe you don't need to know who they are.

468
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
How about you try to find out

469
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,720
why they want you to suffer this much?

470
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh, fuck!

471
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,960
Hey! Tong!

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
No, stop!

473
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,296
Is that a ghost at the door?

474
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,920
- No!
- Oh!

475
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,560
Don't tell me that...

476
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,720
Win! God, damn!

477
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,120
Shit just hit the fan!

478
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,760
Come on, Namo!

479
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,800
Were you trying to break in?

480
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,920
What's the problem?

481
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
What do you mean by that?

482
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
It's worse than just a problem!

483
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
Go to the Spooky Hellish Night
YouTube channel, now!

484
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,680
You're watching Spooky Hellish Night...

485
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
A million views!?

486
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,240
- A fiery night haunted by...
- It's got a million views?!

487
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,960
Yeah.

488
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,880
- I'm Phloengnathitorn.
- Shit.

489
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,560
- We're joined by Jaab...
- But I only rambled nonsense that day!

490
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,256
- To make this an even more special one,
- I even...

491
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,536
- today we're joined by...
- I even messed up the tarot reading!

492
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,720
That's the least of your concern right now.

493
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,560
They've reached out
and want you to be on another EP.

494
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,320
Plus, our agreement said
if this reached a million views,

495
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,479
they'd pay an extra 70,000 baht.

496
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
And they just did that!

497
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,160
- Check your bank account.
- I was cursed,

498
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,960
and I think that I still am.

499
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,480
- What's the story?
- Damn...

500
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
You're famous now!

501
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,176
You no longer have to
skip meals just to get by

502
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,240
and do fortune readings
for those pesky complainers.

503
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,080
And can now enjoy
as much salmon as you like!

504
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,360
I want him to come back to me,

505
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
so I turned to the paranormal.

506
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,560
This generation
is into such things, aren't they?

507
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,600
So where did you go for that?

508
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,800
Hold on...

509
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,440
If I need to record another EP...

510
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,120
Sorry?

511
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,880
This means I'll meet
Phloengnathitorn once again.

512
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,520
It offers good luck wallpapers.

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,040
Or is it him...

514
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,760
the foretold highly virtuous person?

515
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm safe now!

516
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,840
- They let me choose
- What did you say?

517
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,776
- Aspects of my luck to enhance.
- You're safe from what?

518
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,520
- There's career, finance, and love.
- Just know that I'm safe.

519
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,360
I chose love,

520
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,640
since I'd like him to come back to me.

521
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
Sadhu.

522
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
How will this turn out?

523
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Another EP?
But I just had an argument with the host...

524
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,880
I can't concentrate at all.

525
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What are you doing?

526
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Hey!

527
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,520
You scared me, Toh.

528
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,280
This is to protect myself
from the ghost in my dreams.

529
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,880
Lately, I've had nightmares.

530
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,400
Keep an eye on me
so I don't get disturbed, okay?

531
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,840
If that's the case,

532
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,840
then I shall keep you safe!

533
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,520
Come on...

534
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,240
You're being silly again.

535
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,000
Just go already. I'm going to bed.

536
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,600
Fine. I'll go.

537
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,400
Good night, Win.

538
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Enough.

539
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Go, go!

540
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,280
See you.

541
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
Am I already in my dream?

542
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,240
So this is how you want to do it?

543
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,320
You want a piece of me?!

544
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
What?!

545
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Phloeng?

546
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,160
Having nightmares again?

547
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Win...

548
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,920
You're safe now, Win.

549
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,000
Happy one-month-belated birthday,
my dear brother!

550
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,720
She sent you a package, too.

551
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,320
Win, my dearest brother,

552
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,760
your sister is still alive and kicking.

553
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,480
I embedded myself deep
in a village in the northeast.

554
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,160
I used the word 'embed'

555
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,680
because there are various things
worthy of learning here.

556
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,440
Deep in the valleys,
through the rapid streams,

557
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,200
I had to hop on a villager's tractor
to get to my destination.

558
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,640
When I'm back, I'll tell you everything.

559
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,440
Please enjoy your 26th year
as much as you can.

560
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,880
Much love and kisses,

561
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,520
Waew Wongsawat.

562
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,080
This really feels powerful.

563
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,320
What are you doing?

564
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,360
Waew sent me this.

565
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Doesn't it ever occur to you that
she could be a witch?

566
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
A witch?

567
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Think about it,

568
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,840
she's obsessed with mythical rocks,

569
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
and her room is engulfed in aromatic herbs.

570
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
She's even got a black cat as a companion,

571
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,560
going places together.

572
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,200
They say witches keep black cats!

573
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
The cat's name is Batman, though.

574
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,680
Whatever its name is,

575
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,840
I think she's definitely a witch.

576
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
A witch?

577
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,360
A broke witch, then.

578
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,040
She's been working nonstop,

579
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,200
supporting her brother to graduation.

580
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,200
It's a good thing that
she's no longer a witch.

581
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,280
Your sense is such a wasted potential.

582
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,120
Hey.

583
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,800
Nokphaeng sent us the text.

584
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,480
"Meet tomorrow at 10, like last time."

585
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,320
10 A.M. again?

586
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,040
And wait until the cameras roll
at 10 P.M. like last time?

587
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
I made a stipulation.

588
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,920
They'll have to pay
1,000 baht per delayed hour.

589
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,400
This time, we're making millions, Wongsawat!

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
Whoa!

591
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,320
Are they cool with that?

592
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,360
If it's the White Knight Seer,

593
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,080
the rising Twitter star,

594
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
they'd even pay 5,000 baht an hour
to get their hands on you.

595
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Hey, boys.

596
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
What are you doing here?

597
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,960
And what's with the upset faces?

598
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm here for a shoot.

599
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,560
The three of you?

600
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Check in with the staff inside
for the cards, okay?

601
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,520
What did he mean by "three?"

602
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,400
Tong hasn't arrived.

603
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
Or is it Toh?

604
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Wait...

605
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,480
Or is it the karmic creditor
the Venerable Father mentioned?

606
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
Namo, you fool!

607
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm already scared to death of them!

608
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,960
Come on! You'll be fine.

609
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,320
Countless people made it past
their bad luck year.

610
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,600
You might be one of them!

611
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,040
Is that how you cheer someone up?

612
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,840
Are you really entering like that?

613
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,760
Halt!

614
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Hey!

615
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Who's he talking to?

616
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,760
I have no idea.

617
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,920
Don't think your virtuous soul could ever help.

618
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,840
You won't end up dead,

619
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,080
but I'll go after everyone around you.

620
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Win.

621
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,160
Don't be afraid, dude. You have me.

622
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Poverty is way scarier than ghosts.

623
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,680
Let's go.

624
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah, let's get inside already.

625
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,640
Come on! Go, go, go!

626
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,920
- Yeah, let's go.
- Are you ready for the shoot?

627
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,120
Here are your snacks.

628
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Thank you.

629
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,296
- Please enjoy.
- That's so generous of you.

630
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,760
It's okay, Master.

631
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,320
You, the White Knight Seer,

632
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,840
are quite the talk of the town.

633
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
Please make yourself at home.

634
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,040
Feel free to tell me
whatever you want or need.

635
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
I'll get it for you.

636
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,760
No need to worry about my workload.

637
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,680
The bonus pay from this is worth dying for.

638
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,656
It's so much that
I can make a down payment on a car!

639
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,080
I absolutely love this.

640
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,600
I've also got a very generous boss.

641
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,880
If you get to meet him,

642
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm sure you're gonna like him.

643
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
Please enjoy.

644
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Thank you.

645
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
There you are, the renowned Seer.

646
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,360
Hello, Tul.

647
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,600
- Hello.
- Greetings.

648
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm Tul Tulatorn.

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,280
Right. I'm Win Wongsawat.

650
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,400
You're the White Knight Seer?

651
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,680
You can call me that, too.

652
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
You probably haven't met him before.

653
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,280
This is Tul, the owner of the company.

654
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
Oh, you're the owner?

655
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Huh?!

656
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,000
He's the owner, as in...

657
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,920
The owner of the entire Siam Nithrarom?

658
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
That's right.

659
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,176
- Nice to meet you.
- It's good to see you.

660
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
No need for such formalities.

661
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,400
Please make yourselves at home.

662
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,240
I just wanted to welcome you.

663
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,040
Also, I watched that EP
of Spooky Hellish Night.

664
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,920
You were very natural.

665
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
I appreciate that.

666
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
And you...

667
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,560
Are you Namo, the manager?

668
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,440
That's correct.

669
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,880
It's nice to meet you.

670
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,920
Please have my business card.

671
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Here you go.

672
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Oh, Job?

673
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,600
Did you tell the Master about the show?

674
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,320
What show?

675
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Job.

676
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,440
Here's the deal.

677
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,400
We're planning on making
a fortune-telling show,

678
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,320
and we'd love to have you as its host.

679
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Huh?

680
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,040
Me?

681
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,600
If it's not you,
then there's nobody else who could.

682
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Well...

683
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,800
I've never done anything like this.

684
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm not a great speaker.

685
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
I've only done behind-the-scenes stuff.

686
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
I'm afraid that...

687
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,880
Don't worry, Master.

688
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,440
Here at Siam Nithrarom,
we've got experts in everything

689
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,760
from creative and marketing

690
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,080
to video editing.

691
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,120
If you need any assistance,

692
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,400
please tell us.

693
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,480
We're ready to support you 24/7.

694
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,160
You don't have to make a decision right now,

695
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
but kindly consider the offer.

696
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Right.

697
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,760
I'll think about it.

698
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,160
As for the payment,

699
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,280
it will be worth your while.

700
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Right.

701
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,680
How's the contract?

702
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,360
Let me read all of the details first.

703
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,320
For today's EP, Nokphaeng wants it to be
as natural as it can be.

704
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,640
You could've at least
told me the topic of this EP,

705
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,520
or given my team some hints.

706
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,240
Oh, Master.

707
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,000
I have no clue about that either.

708
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
I'm just the project coordinator.

709
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,096
Well, if there's anything you'd like to know,

710
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,760
you may want to ask Phloeng himself.

711
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
He's in that room.

712
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,216
That might not be a good idea.

713
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
It will be.

714
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,440
He told me not to let anyone in

715
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,040
but the White Knight Seer.

716
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,040
Huh? Why is that?

717
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,520
I'm not sure about that, but...

718
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
I have to go now.

719
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,320
I've got work to do.

720
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,360
Right.

721
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,040
(Tong: On my way! I got lost again)

722
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,720
(Win: Hurry up, Namo abandoned me...)

723
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Yok?

724
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,000
What brings you here?

725
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,240
I miss my dad.

726
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,800
So Phloeng must've gotten a woman pregnant

727
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
and made her get an abortion.

728
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,200
You'd like to see your father?

729
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,840
If you get to meet him,

730
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,720
you'd finally cross over, right?

731
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,400
Cross over what?

732
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,080
Oh, you innocent soul.

733
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,520
I feel so sorry for you.

734
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,640
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

735
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Phloeng?

736
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,960
Phloeng.

737
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,120
If you don't mind, I'm going in.

738
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Phloeng.

739
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Phloeng?

740
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Phloeng.

741
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,360
No, you're still alive.

742
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,640
Of course, if you act normally for once,

743
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,560
you'd become too perfect, wouldn't you?

744
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,440
I'd like to talk to the Master,

745
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,680
now that he's here.

746
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,120
You can talk here.

747
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
What are you looking at?

748
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Nothing.

749
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,040
If you want to stare at my chest,

750
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,280
just ask.

751
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
Hey, look out!

752
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Master, watch out!

753
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,600
Are you ready?

754
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,120
Are you ready?!
