(Directed by: Siwasit Phondongnok)

12
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,000
Well...

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
If I say it was a ghost,

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
would you believe me?

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,400
It turned into Namo
and tried to trick me.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Of course.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,520
So you believe me?

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,760
Of course, I don't.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
What, Phloeng?!

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
I just drove past Namo
on the way home.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,040
His motorbike is also really loud.

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,800
If he came here,

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,560
you'd hear
his motorbike first, correct?

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,960
With a motorcycle that loud,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
the dogs would've barked.

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,240
How would you explain
what I just experienced?

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
Mm...

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,480
Too much sleeping
causes you to see things?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
Fish oil helps, you know?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
I think...

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,240
I thought I was done for.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Are you sure you're not just looking
for an excuse to hug me?

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,320
And... Are you the real one?

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
When did you return home?

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Why didn't I see your car?

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
I arrived here a while ago.

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,480
You assumed that I'm a ghost?

38
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,840
Whoa, so sweet.

39
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,880
I'd better tell this to Grandpa.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
Stop it, Petch.

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
You may enter.

42
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,040
So...

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,400
What did you want
to tell me a while ago?

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Come here.

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,920
Perhaps what you're dealing with

46
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,560
may not simply be ghosts
or a karmic creditor.

47
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,200
What do you mean?

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,120
If it's actually
your karmic creditor,

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
think about what they want

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,640
after what they've done
throughout your life.

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
They didn't kill me
when they could.

52
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
Are they tormenting me just for fun?

53
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,080
The ability to possess someone...

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,080
No ordinary ghost has that power.

55
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,320
What do you mean, Wayu?

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
If it's not dark magic,

57
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,280
then it's something far worse.

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Ultimately, incantations
are just tools.

59
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,760
The power comes from your will.

60
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
The chant
doesn't have to be perfect,

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
as long as you have
strong willpower.

62
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Study them in case you need them.

63
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,080
So difficult.

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
I can't even understand
some of them

65
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,840
or what they're for.

66
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Hello, what is it?

67
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,840
Hello, Namo.

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,360
Can you find me a book?

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, sure.

70
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
Which one?

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,200
The purple one.

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
It's on the shelf.

73
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
Take photos of it
and send them to me.

74
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,120
Sure. Sit tight, okay?

75
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
Is that it?

76
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Mm.

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm preparing
for the winter solstice.

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Right. Good luck, okay?

79
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,200
I hope it's over soon,
so we can go back to making money.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,760
Mm.

81
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
See you.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
Win, are you ready?

83
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,096
What kind of prank
is this, Grandpa?

84
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,920
We're going to catch pneumonia.

85
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,280
Watch your mouth, Phloeng.

86
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm performing
a ritual to save Win.

87
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
This is not a funny prank.

88
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,080
Whatever the case,

89
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
I've got a show
to work on at 2 A.M.

90
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Make it quick.

91
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
Are you crazy?

92
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,800
I told you to take a leave
on the day of the ritual.

93
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
You need to stay with Win
until the ritual is complete.

94
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll stay until it's done,

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
but make sure
it's complete before that hour.

96
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,760
Oh, once this ridiculous ritual
is over,

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm taking Win back to the city.

98
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm done with this crazy town.

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
You, of all people...

100
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
How did you end up
as a highly virtuous soul?

101
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,360
You're such a contrarian.

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Hungry?

103
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
A little bit.

104
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
But I can manage.

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,240
Grandpa,

106
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
why do we have to fast?

107
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,080
This is a cleansing ritual,
not a CT scan.

108
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Wayu.

109
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,160
Give him a word of warning

110
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
that if he doesn't stop talking,

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll drown him.

112
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,960
Grandpa, stop arguing with him.

113
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
You're about to turn 100,

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
but here you are
still arguing with him.

115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm way less than 100 years old.

116
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,880
If you want to quit, just tell me.

117
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,360
You're going to take me home?

118
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,560
If something happens
to your grandpa or Wayu,

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,680
what will you do?

120
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
Win...

121
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,520
This is Elder Master Phupha's house.

122
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,600
Wayu is also
an Elder Master's medium.

123
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,600
The one sitting behind you
was born on an auspicious day.

124
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
If someone were to trouble you,

125
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,000
we'll kick their butts
before they could move an inch.

126
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Just you wait.

127
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Just do as Grandpa says

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
so that this stupid ritual is over.

129
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
I heard that.

130
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,360
Win, meditate.

131
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,000
No matter what happens,

132
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
do not get out of the tub
or leave the sacred ground.

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,760
No matter what you hear

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
or what you see,

135
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,160
remain still.

136
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,280
Repeat the chant after me
until the ritual is complete.

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Win!

138
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Win, can you hear me?

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Help me.

140
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Right, here they come!

141
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Win!

142
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,520
Save me!

143
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
What the hell is this?

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Do not get out
of this sacred ground.

145
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
And...

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Where do we go
from here, Elder Master?

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,960
Concentrate.

148
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
We'll track down
the source of this evil.

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Focus.

150
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Find

151
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
the way.

152
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm back in this nightmare realm.

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,520
Sh*t!

154
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
Where the hell am I?

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hey.

156
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Who are you?

157
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
What the hell?!

158
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Let go!

159
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,160
Dreams are random.

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,520
They might jump
back and forth and confuse you.

161
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
However, concentrate your mind.

162
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Don't let them trick you
into getting trapped in a labyrinth.

163
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
The fact that you made it this far

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,000
means I've lost.

165
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
It's my karmic creditor.

166
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Lost?

167
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,320
What do you mean?

168
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,800
That's because you've found me.

169
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,120
That's my condition.

170
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Your condition?

171
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
When did you make it?

172
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
When did we make a contract?

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
The condition is

174
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,320
once you find me,

175
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,720
the ritual of spirit transfer
shall end.

176
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,560
The ritual of spirit transfer?

177
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Yes, you fool.

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,320
I don't get
what you mean by the ritual.

179
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,400
What is the ritual
of spirit transfer?

180
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
And who are you?

181
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,920
You're not my karmic creditor?

182
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
It's funny

183
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,440
that you still think this is all
due to your bad luck year.

184
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,800
Karmic creditor?

185
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,040
It's so you.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
You're sorrowful.

187
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
F*ck off!

188
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,840
What is this place?

189
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,520
It's my property.

190
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Are we in Thailand?

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Yes, you doorknob.

192
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Have you heard of the Maitreya Era?

193
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,120
Maitreya...

194
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
I haven't.

195
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Idiot.

196
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
Why did you claim others' lives?

197
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,240
I didn't do it.

198
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,920
Your friend used
dark magic on them.

199
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Tong?

200
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Tong.

201
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,760
Tong, your best friend.

202
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
You used him as a puppet?

203
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
You could say that.

204
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,880
But at the end of the day,
I've lost to you, doorknob.

205
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,120
You summoned me here,
so can you at least explain

206
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
what the hell is going on?

207
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,560
I didn't summon you.

208
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,960
I didn't even wish to see you.

209
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,520
It was because of
those pesky twins and that old man.

210
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
They broke the condition

211
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,720
and completely ruined my ritual.

212
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,680
You mean Phloeng and his family?

213
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,160
Whatever the hell you call them...

214
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,120
You've won anyway.

215
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
Are you done?

216
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Old man, can you hear me?

217
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
You've won.

218
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
In the year 5000,

219
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,320
the era of the Buddha
you know will end.

220
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The universe will witness
the birth of the next Buddha.

221
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,960
After 5000 B.E.,

222
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,200
that's what the Maitreya Era is.

223
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,920
It's supposed to be
a very prosperous era, isn't it?

224
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,400
You're both stupid and clueless.

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
I can sense despair.

226
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't tell me that...

227
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,960
Before the next Buddha descends
to enlighten the beings,

228
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,200
humanity has to go
through its lowest point first.

229
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,160
People will compete
their way to the top.

230
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,560
Governments will be corrupted,
driving nations to the ground.

231
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,240
If one despises another,

232
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,760
they'll be able to simply shoot

233
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,840
or stab others to death.

234
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
Empathy will disappear
from humanity.

235
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,440
The youth that you know

236
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,600
will have families prematurely.

237
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,520
The human lifespan
will be less than 20 years.

238
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,720
Is it that bad?

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,680
Of course, you idiot.

240
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,879
This transition from the era
of the old Buddha

241
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,160
to the new one is called

242
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
the Dark Age,

243
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,920
the age when humanity causes chaos
and brings about total annihilation.

244
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
Now, do you understand
what I'm saying?

245
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Even though I'm at the top,

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,160
I'll never be able to flee
from the Dark Age.

247
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,160
You're saying that

248
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,160
this is what the future looks like?

249
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
I don't know.

250
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
Then what do you mean?

251
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,880
Anything is possible.

252
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,160
I get it now.

253
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,120
You simply want to transfer
your spirit into my body.

254
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,800
You have no intentions
of hurting me.

255
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,560
Who would want to die in this era?

256
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,080
While my spirit was wandering,

257
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,000
I simply stumbled upon
you as an option.

258
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,680
I wasn't even sure
if you're from the past, the future,

259
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
an alternate universe,

260
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,080
or a different dimension,

261
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,600
but simply being able
to possess you is enough.

262
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,360
Why can you possess others?

263
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
Are you a shaman?

264
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,080
Answer me. Who are you?

265
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
Win, the seer.

266
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,280
You are...

267
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,640
You're me?

268
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes, I'm Win, the seer.

269
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,160
No matter which lifetime
or era we're born into,

270
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
we are reborn as Win, the seer.

271
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
What's happening?

272
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,680
It's the Dark Age.

273
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,200
It's reaching its climax.

274
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
I need to get the hell out of here.

275
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,920
There must be another way out.

276
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,360
There isn't.

277
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,680
You need to leave.

278
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
You can't be here.

279
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
If that's the case,

280
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,120
will you sacrifice yourself,
so I can possess you?

281
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,200
I lost.

282
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,280
Well played, Win.

283
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
No!

284
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Don't turn around!

285
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
What the hell?

286
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
What's wrong with him?

287
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
He's fighting.

288
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Keep chanting. Hurry.

289
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,240
You just want
to stay alive, don't you?

290
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
So do I.

291
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,960
What we both want
is to stay alive, correct?

292
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
No.

293
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
I can't do it again.

294
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
You can.

295
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,520
Use the same incantation,

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,960
the one that led you to me.

297
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
It's impossible!

298
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,200
You need to leave, Win.

299
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
No!

300
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
You have to come with me!

301
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,720
Leave, you fool!

302
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,080
Enjoy your life for me, will you?

303
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Win!

304
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,680
Win, wake up!

305
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
Welcome back.

306
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,960
Phloeng?

307
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,480
D*mn!

308
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,800
Your life is perfect
for 'The Story of My Life.'

309
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
Num Kanchai had better
get ahold of you.

310
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,480
He's the host
of 'Hone-Krasae, ' you idiot.

311
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Whatever.

312
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
But what you told me was phenomenal.

313
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,720
Not only were you scared by ghosts,

314
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,960
but you also learned more
about Buddhism.

315
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,240
That's wild!

316
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Let me have a look.

317
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,920
So your karmic creditor is yourself?

318
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,280
It's hard to explain,

319
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
but, technically, it is.

320
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,600
He came here
from 2,000 years in the future?

321
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Maybe.

322
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,880
"Maybe"?

323
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,080
You wrote that
he came from 5000 B.E.

324
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,600
Enough! I don't want you
to read it anymore.

325
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
What?!

326
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Is the underwear yours or Phloeng's?

327
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,160
It's mine!

328
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Fold it and put it in my luggage.

329
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,760
The White Knight Seer...

330
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,720
No matter how many times I'm reborn,

331
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll always become a fortune teller.

332
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,960
It's just like legendary musicians.

333
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,200
No matter
how many times they're reborn,

334
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,480
they'll end up as musicians.

335
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,360
You said that your karmic creditor
was a bit of a cult leader.

336
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
You mentioned that
he had followers, too,

337
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,400
like an abbot
from that infamous temple?

338
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,200
I felt like that hit me, too,
for some reason.

339
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,240
No, no.

340
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,880
That abbot isn't just
an average fortune teller like you.

341
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,840
He claims that
he can travel across realms,

342
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,720
like Wanda Maximoff
and her Dreamwalking ability.

343
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
But why did he want to kill you?

344
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
To fully possess someone,

345
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
the body must not have
its soul attached to it,

346
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,480
like an empty container.

347
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,440
There's only one way to make
one's soul leave their body...

348
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,040
The host must die first!

349
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
What, Elder Master?

350
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,840
If the body is but an empty husk,
how would it work?

351
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,920
By displacing
the host's spirit with theirs.

352
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,360
(Buddha Phutthasothon)

353
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Tong?

354
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,840
Since that day,

355
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,800
I decided it would be best
to become a monk's assistant.

356
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,800
It wasn't your fault, Tong.

357
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,960
You were used.

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,040
Maybe it had to do with the ill will
I had toward others.

359
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
I forgive you.

360
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,040
Tell me when you're coming back.

361
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,200
Without you,

362
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,360
I wouldn't have become
Master Win that everybody knows.

363
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,760
What was it like back there?

364
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,080
It was like
I was in a different world,

365
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,080
the world that was
on the brink of destruction.

366
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Really?

367
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,560
Why did your karmic creditor
want your body?

368
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,600
He just wanted to stay alive

369
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
in his crumbling world.

370
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,000
You didn't do
anything weird there, did you?

371
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,440
I only tried doing something.

372
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,000
I didn't know if it was possible.

373
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,320
Had I had the knowledge,

374
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,880
I would've been able to save him.

375
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Win.

376
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,280
We simply can't save everyone.

377
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,360
But if there's anything
you'd like to know,

378
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
just tell me.

379
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,520
What are you talking about?

380
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
A secret.

381
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,400
Win, tell me!

382
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
Win!

383
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,040
Come on, if you want to stay
at my house for a bit longer,

384
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,240
I have no problems with that, dear.

385
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,840
I've caused you
and Wayu trouble for days now,

386
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,520
so please let me go home.

387
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,840
What do you mean?

388
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,640
You're part
of our family at this point.

389
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Soon enough,
you'll also be my son-in-law.

390
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,480
How upsetting!

391
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,160
I also want
a love story like theirs.

392
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,760
I want to get possessed, too,
if you know what I mean.

393
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
What the hell?

394
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
You're being too flirty.

395
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,240
- What the hell?
- Right...

396
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Let's just say this is where
we part ways for now, Grandpa.

397
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Bye-bye.

398
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
I'll bring Win
to your place again soon.

399
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
We'll be going now.

400
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Are you tired?

401
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,240
No, I'm not.

402
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,280
What about you? Are you tired?

403
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Not at all.

404
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,600
It's been a fun day.

405
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
It feels like a dream.

406
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,560
Thank you.

407
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,480
For what exactly?

408
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
Well...

409
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,560
For waking me up.

410
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Your face looked like someone
who needed to poop.

411
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,560
So I tried waking you up.

412
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,440
You always ruin the mood, don't you?

413
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,040
And...

414
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,720
Did you get
to record the show in time?

415
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
You said that it was at 2 A.M.,

416
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,240
but...

417
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,080
it was almost morning
when I woke up.

418
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
I didn't.

419
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
What?

420
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,560
Did the crew wait for you?

421
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,440
Was it because of me?

422
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
I'm so sorry.

423
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,880
You owe me once already.

424
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,480
How should I repay you, then?

425
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
What are you looking at?

426
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Well...

427
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,000
It's your son.

428
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
You mean Yok?

429
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
Wait, you know?

430
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Of course, I do.

431
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,480
Grandpa has been
talking about him for ages.

432
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,640
You mean that
you're always aware of Yok.

433
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,040
But you don't
believe in ghosts, do you?

434
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,680
I don't.

435
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Huh?

436
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
I haven't seen one,
so I don't believe they exist.

437
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,040
That could break Yok's heart
if he heard that.

438
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,840
He was born to safeguard you.

439
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,040
On top of that,
he also calls you Dad.

440
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,560
He calls me Dad?

441
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,040
So that makes you

442
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
his mom?

443
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,440
It's not like that.

444
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,320
Is this our final encounter?

445
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,280
Thank you so much, Phloeng.

446
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,960
Without you, I'd be screwed.

447
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Of course, you would.

448
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,960
From now on, there's nothing left
for you to rely on me for.

449
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Right.

450
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Regardless,

451
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,880
I still want you
to keep falling back on me.

452
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,800
The scent of summer...

453
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,520
It's getting so much stronger!

454
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,216
Even if you aren't scared of ghosts,

455
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,440
feel free to stay at my place.

456
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,600
I can't stand sleeping alone now.

457
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,280
Toh.

458
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm back.

459
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,720
What's wrong, Toh?

460
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,560
You never stay by my side, Win.

461
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,440
I already prayed for you, though.

462
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,680
Yet...

463
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Why are you still making that face?

464
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,560
Are you heartbroken or something?

465
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,520
Can a ghost
and a person love each other?

466
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,120
They can't, Toh.

467
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,360
I only see us as brothers, really.

468
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,200
Also, I've got...

469
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,560
I'm not referring to you.

470
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
It's someone else.

471
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,880
Who is it, Toh?

472
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Huh?!

473
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,480
Don't tell me that you...

474
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,560
With a ghost
after you broke up with your ex?

475
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Correct.

476
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,160
Is there a way to make him appear?

477
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,600
I don't want to summon spirits
as suggested online.

478
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,720
What does this ghost look like?

479
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Like...

480
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
F*ck!

481
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,120
How dare you leave me?!

482
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
You can see me?

483
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Of course.

484
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,760
I'm heartbroken.

485
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,040
I want to feel better.

486
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,880
I guess he's handsome,

487
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
muscular,

488
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,800
and big.

489
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,120
Don't tell me that...

490
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
Spill it out, Toh.

491
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,560
Well...

492
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,840
It's just like what he says.

493
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,760
Good heavens.

494
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,360
No wonder you were out of merit.

495
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
That's why.

496
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
I think...

497
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
There is a way.

498
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
Was it you?

499
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Take off your mask.

500
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,160
I hope everything's intact.

501
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
I'm scared.

502
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,600
I've heard that
you're no longer working with Win.

503
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm taking a rest.

504
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,880
I'll return when I'm ready.

505
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,200
I didn't expect to see you here.

506
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,200
But yeah...

507
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,320
After all the things that happened,

508
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,960
I want to change
myself for the better.

509
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,400
Visiting temples isn't that bad.

510
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,320
I think I'm going to visit
the temple every evening.

511
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,520
It's a good thing, really.

512
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,960
It keeps our minds calm and sharp.

513
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
You're right.

514
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,120
Oh, about Win's show...

515
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,720
It might start next week.

516
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,160
If you're still interested,

517
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,560
feel free to work with us.

518
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,080
Thank you for inviting me.

519
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Right.

520
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,840
I guess I'll see you around.

521
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,800
Without Tong by my side,

522
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,840
I have to do everything myself.

523
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Win.

524
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Phloeng?

525
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
I'll help.

526
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,120
Is there a problem?

527
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,440
I don't want to sleep alone.

528
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Are you alright?

529
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Let's have a sleepover.

530
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,080
My under-eyes are so dark from
all the EPs I've been recording.

531
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
I can't sleep well.

532
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400
You're now afraid of ghosts?

533
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,160
Whether I'm staying here or not,

534
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,040
you still can't sleep.

535
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,600
Next time, I'm not coming.

536
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,480
Phloeng.

537
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
You want my heart to burst or what?

538
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,480
What do you mean?

539
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,600
Do you want to go on a weekend trip?

540
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Sure thing.

541
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,080
Please wait
until the weekdays are over, okay?

542
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,120
Gosh, please no.

543
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,560
I'm done talking.

544
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,960
I don't want to go to work.

545
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Phloeng.

546
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,360
You're looking cute.

547
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
I can sense your charm
from way up above.

548
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,080
Gosh, stop teasing me already.

549
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,840
Should I get my hair dyed, too?

550
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,720
So you won't feel lonely.

551
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,600
Should I dye it red?

552
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,720
Cut it out.

553
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,480
This jacket looks familiar.

554
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,440
You still don't want to go home?

555
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
If I do,

556
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,400
I won't have any excuse
to stay here with someone.

557
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,560
But usually,

558
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,960
you're great at making excuses.

559
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,920
Your cheeks are so chubby!

560
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,560
Do you want to go home already?

561
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I don't.

562
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Well...

563
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,760
I performed a cleansing ritual
for a tycoon's offspring today.

564
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,840
Their scent became
so different, though.

565
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,120
Is it a good or a bad thing?

566
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,880
I don't know.

567
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,560
But I think
the client was possessed.

568
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,640
However, from the looks of it,

569
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
the person wasn't sick

570
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,040
but was wearing a leg cast

571
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,280
due to a recent car accident.

572
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,400
Usually, a person's scent
never changes.

573
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,040
You can remember everybody's scent?

574
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,960
If I know them, then I can.

575
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,480
How cute.

576
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
You complimented me
like I'm a dog, you know?

577
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,360
This means that

578
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,680
you also remember my scent?

579
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Of course.

580
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,800
Your scent

581
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,800
is like that of summer.

582
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Summer?

583
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,480
I've never told this to you, have I?

584
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
How exactly?

585
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,600
What if summer
isn't my personal scent...

586
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,840
but my emotional scent?

587
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
Emotional scent?

588
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
A strong emotional scent

589
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
that overpowers other emotions.

590
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,360
Phloeng...

591
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,080
Now you know that

592
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,840
it isn't my unique scent.

593
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,280
It's the scent of love.

594
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,320
It has always been that way.

595
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,560
Phloeng...

596
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,720
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

597
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,600
What's your answer?

598
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
I do.

599
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,800
I thought
you'd never ask me the question.

600
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,240
I thought I'd ask you next week,

601
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,360
but I saw you on the dating app,

602
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,000
so I changed my mind.

603
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
I don't want anyone else
to fall for my pink-haired boy.

604
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,040
Namo forced me to use the app.

605
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,520
He claimed that
good things would happen.

606
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,080
And...

607
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Is Elder Master's prophecy true?

608
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Well...

609
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,120
I tried to prove him wrong

610
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,280
because he's such a tease.

611
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,520
However, I couldn't resist.

612
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,320
Resist what?

613
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Well...

614
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,240
You're too cute.

615
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,280
I want to make you mine.

616
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Try me, then.
