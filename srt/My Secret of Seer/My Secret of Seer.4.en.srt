Is it urgent?

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I'll send you the files tonight.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,936
Okay. I'll make sure
I send them to you tonight.

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Hey.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,920
Are you aware that
bad luck is coming your way?

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,400
Sorry, I'll get back to you.

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
What do you mean by that?

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,400
Someone in your family
will suffer serious misfortune.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Is there a way out of this,
fortune teller?

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
What do you mean?

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
You can't look after my dad for me?

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,560
I already have,

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,960
but I have my own work to do, too.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
I get that,

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,960
but do you know what time it is?

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Why don't you

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,560
hire an actual caretaker
for your dad?

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
I'm your boyfriend, remember?

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
I only stopped by a shrine
for a minute or two.

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm heading home soon.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
What nonsense
are you talking about?

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Stop believing in
those ridiculous ideas.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,600
Job.
Yes?

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,800
Have you prepared
for the shooting location yet?

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
Yes, I have.

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,840
Mm.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Get to work, then.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Understood.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Win.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Nokphaeng absolutely enjoyed
your last night's livestream.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,280
He says you have
a naive, sweet personality,

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,760
and that Phloeng knows
how to get people engaged, too.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,359
Our show's rating
is going to shoot up

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,920
to the moon at this rate.

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,400
It's "their" show.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,680
What do you mean it's ours?

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Right. It's whatever,

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
but we're both getting paid

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,640
and growing a fan base.

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,200
We'll then have passive income.

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
See that, Win?

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
I think our luck
is at an all-time high.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Every card you see
will be a Pentacle,

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
guaranteed by yours truly.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,840
You're saying that
in my bad luck year,

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,640
when a potted plant
almost killed me on the spot?

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
Hey, guys!

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,920
Someone bought our whole stock.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,560
We have to celebrate
the success, right?

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
Later.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
When is my last client?

64
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Hold on.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,920
It's May next year.

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm going to pass out.

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,040
Come on.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
Just stick to your goals.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,880
You should also inform your clients.

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440
I think they'll get it.

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Just stick to ten clients per day,
for funsies.

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,800
(Tul: Schedule Win a meeting for me.
(It's about the show)

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,200
By the way, Namo,

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
when is the next show's recording?

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
This Friday.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Okay, a two-day rest
is better than nothing.

77
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Oh, right...

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
I've got to go now.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
What?

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Where are you going?

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
A secret.

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,000
See you.

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
Judging from how you dress,
it must be a date.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm wearing all black.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm attending a funeral, damn it.

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
Be seeing you.

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,400
Oh, I almost forgot.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm coming home a bit late tonight.

89
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Bye.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, Win...

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,240
I forgot to tell you something.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
You have a meeting with Tul today.

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,520
Thank you.

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,680
Hello, Tul.

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Hello, Master.

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Please take a seat.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
Uh...

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Why do you call me
for a meeting today?

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,960
Is it about the livestream?

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
That's right.

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,120
I've done a live show
as you told me.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
How was it?

103
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,920
The reception was amazing.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
You looked so natural.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Is it a good thing?

106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
It is.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
That's lovely.

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
What are you saying, Tul?

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,800
I was just doing my work.

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,280
Doing so much reading in one go

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
is very exhausting, though.

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
Is it, Master?

113
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm really sorry.
I never knew that.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
Oh, it's totally fine.

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

116
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,520
- Enjoy, Master.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Is that

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,240
an injury from that day?

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh...

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
It is.

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,080
No need to worry, though.

122
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
It's nothing serious.

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Just a second.

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes?

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,440
Here.

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Let me change it up.

127
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Sure.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Thank you.

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,880
It's me who has to thank you

130
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,400
for saving me on that day.

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Look at you.

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,360
You got hurt because of me.

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,800
It's totally fine.

134
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Uh...

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,560
I think we should dig in.

136
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
- Right.
- Enjoy.

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,880
How is it? Is it good?

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,960
It is.

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,680
- This way.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,160
Thank you very much, Tul,

141
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
for treating me to this meal.

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Don't mention it.

143
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
It's me who has to thank you.

144
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,240
You helped make my show go viral.

145
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Right.

146
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
If that's everything,

147
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,920
I'm bidding you farewell.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Should I drive you home?

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
Well...

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,360
It's okay.

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
Don't let me stop you
from your work.

152
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Sure.

153
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Well then...

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,920
Let's do this again sometime.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sure.

156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
- I'll be seeing you soon.
- Right.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
Aww...

158
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,360
You're beaming, Win.

159
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
Who's beaming, Toh?

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
And where have you been?

161
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Been seeing a girl?

162
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,880
It's just the usual.

163
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,640
I've been wandering
around where I died.

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
You knew that

165
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,840
I rode my motorbike

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,560
and got cut to death by wires.

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
My skull was completely exposed.

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,520
The temple is as far as I can go.

169
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,440
I don't want to go there, however.

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,440
The ghosts there always torment me.

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,920
What are you doing here?
Are you lonely?

172
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm not.

173
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
You're free tomorrow.

174
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,280
Please make merit for me.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm hungry.

176
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,640
Sure, I'll do that just for you.

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm kind of wealthy now.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
You are?

179
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
If so...

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
Can you do me a favor?

181
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,920
I want to see

182
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,920
a stripper

183
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,920
with big breasts?

184
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
My reincarnation can wait.

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,360
I'm so thirsty for them right now.

186
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,776
- You're such a pervert, Toh.
- Ow!

187
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,720
I wasn't talking
about someone else's, you know?

188
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,720
- I'm talking about your breasts.
- Hey!

189
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Ouch!

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,360
How can someone be
this adorable talking to himself?

191
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
What?

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
You promised me
you'd take me there.

193
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
You're always like this.

194
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,640
Your excuse is work? Again?

195
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,360
Have you ever kept your promises?

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh, so you're saying
I'm in the wrong?

197
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
We're done talking, then.

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
Oh?

199
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Job!

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,480
Oh, Master.

201
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,360
What...

202
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
What brings you here?

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
Oh, I'm on my way to a market

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,840
to get an offering.

205
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Why, though?

206
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,560
My dad's sick.

207
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,160
My mom visited a fortune teller.

208
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
She was told
to get an offering for the shrine.

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,560
I've tried everything,

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,520
from doctors to superstitions,

211
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,880
just like Chai said.

212
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
My dad is still doing fine, though.

213
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,880
Would you like to come with me?

214
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Are you sure?

215
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,520
Why are we stopping here, Job?

216
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,240
We're in the middle of the woods.

217
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,480
To make an offering to the shrine.

218
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
There.

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
Shit...

220
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,440
It's situated
at a three-way junction.

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,400
Mm, that's right.

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,960
Let's get it done
before it gets dark.

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Sure.

224
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,000
I was told to place
the offering in front of the shrine

225
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,520
and put some incense on the food.

226
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
How many?

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
A single incense stick.

228
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,400
Shit...

229
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,776
These are for ghosts, I'm sure.

230
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Huh? What was that?

231
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Nothing.

232
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
She told me that once I was done,

233
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480
I should turn around
and leave immediately.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
Let's just get this done.

235
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Okay.

236
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,000
Can I ask you a question?

237
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
Why do we need to hurry?

238
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,600
Just do as I said.

239
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Okay.

240
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Master...

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is there a problem?

242
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
I think I might've left
my phone by the shrine.

243
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Damn it.

244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
And...

245
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,680
Is it that important?

246
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,040
Of course, it is, Master.

247
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,480
It's my phone.

248
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
You're right.

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Here's the plan.

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,400
I'll fetch it for you.

251
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Sure.

252
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,800
(Husband)

253
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
Go away!

254
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
Remember me?

255
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't know who you are!

256
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Job!

257
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Here's your phone.

258
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Master?

259
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,800
Are you coming back?

260
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
Why have you gone silent?

261
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you really think
you can do anything to me?

262
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,640
Don't think that
being with a highly virtuous soul

263
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,480
would protect you from me.

264
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,640
Fucking tell me who you are

265
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,920
and what you want!

266
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,440
I'll never tell you.

267
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,200
Master!

268
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Master Win!

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm right here.

270
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Phloeng?

271
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
That's Phloeng's voice.

272
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,360
Are you good, Master?

273
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,520
I hurt my knee.

274
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,040
What trouble
did you just get yourself into?

275
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,840
I forgot my phone at the shrine,

276
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,240
so I asked him to get it for me.

277
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Here.

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,600
Thank you very much.

279
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Can you walk?

280
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,360
No need to carry me, Phloeng.

281
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,520
Who says that I will?

282
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,360
You were about to do that.

283
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,920
Has all the card reading
made you lose your mind?

284
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Fine, I guess.

285
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,640
I'm not going to ask you to do that.

286
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
I'd better call Tul.

287
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Let me escort you to your condo.

288
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,360
I can go home by myself.

289
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Fine...

290
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
Get me home.

291
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Fuck...

292
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,560
I'm screwed.

293
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,640
I turned and looked at the shrine.

294
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,240
Goddammit.

295
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,880
No matter how many times,

296
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,640
you always end up getting hurt.

297
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,400
It's not like I want
to get hurt, you know.

298
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Next time I see you get hurt again,

299
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,400
I'll take it as a sign
you're hitting on me.

300
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,760
Nonsense.

301
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,280
You're actually quite heavy, Master.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
If that's the case,

303
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,560
you can just put me down.

304
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,720
I can walk.

305
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
How can I let you go?

306
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,440
I'm going to take your body.

307
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,560
I can't do anything to you for now,

308
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,960
but the ones around you

309
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
will all be dead.

310
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Are you alright?

311
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Yes.

312
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,360
Did we arrive a while ago?

313
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Yes.

314
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
You were sleeping,

315
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
so I didn't want to wake you.

316
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,200
You should see a doctor, Master.

317
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
Oh, it's fine.

318
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,680
I've got a medical kit in my room.

319
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Thank you for driving me home.

320
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,520
Would you like
to get a drink in my room first?

321
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
That'd be nice.

322
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
I can walk, actually.

323
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
I wouldn't get a drink

324
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
if I let you walk
on your own, would I?

325
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Win.

326
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes?

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,960
What happened to your leg?

328
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,440
Why is it in this state?

329
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,680
I fell over.

330
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,680
- Oh.
- So my colleague drove me here.

331
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,720
It's a relief that you're fine.

332
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,640
I've heard that
you're employed, aren't you?

333
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,200
You didn't tell me about that
when you came to my room.

334
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
- I'm so happy for you.
- Right.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
Thank you.

336
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,360
By the way,
my door's is locked again.

337
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
Can you help me with that?

338
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll look into that for you.

339
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,800
Please hang tight, okay?

340
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,320
Sure thing.

341
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,280
(Tul: Are you back in your room?)

342
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh?

343
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,320
Where did she go?

344
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Let me take care of
the door first, okay?

345
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Sure.

346
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
It hasn't broken down or anything.

347
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Hey!

348
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Chakart!

349
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,280
Chakart...

350
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Chakart!

351
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Hey!

352
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Phloeng...

353
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,440
What do we do?

354
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Calm down, Win.

355
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm going to call the police.

356
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Hello.

357
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,000
Someone's found dead

358
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
in a condo.

359
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,680
Please come here right now.

360
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Right.

361
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,960
Is it true, Win?

362
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
As soon as the water recedes,
I'll rush to you.

363
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
No need, Waew.

364
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,600
Don't cross the water.
It's dangerous.

365
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,400
Moreover, she's already passed.

366
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,960
You returning here
won't change anything.

367
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,320
I think we simply help her
in ways that we can.

368
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
How is it going on your end?

369
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,280
The police assume that

370
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,560
she had acute heart failure.

371
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,440
She passed away over six hours ago.

372
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,920
Still, it's very strange.

373
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
None of the security cameras
are working.

374
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,400
She must've met a peaceful end.

375
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Waew...

376
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,560
Once everything's over,

377
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
please rush back to me, okay?

378
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,600
I think something is not right.

379
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,520
Thank you for walking me to my car.

380
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,000
Please get some rest.

381
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Yes?

382
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,120
Phloeng, for this scene,
you need to sit in the tub.

383
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,400
It's a scene
where you'll be meditating.

384
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,880
I need to face
the camera B, correct?

385
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,120
Yes, sit...

386
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,656
- Sit on the right, the camera's right.
- Would you like a drink?

387
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Give us a moment.

388
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Okay.

389
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Want a drink?

390
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
You're scared of ghosts?

391
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,640
No, the smoke is hurting my eyes.

392
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,480
So, a drink or no?

393
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Yes, please.

394
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Get in the car.

395
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,600
And...

396
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,176
If you're afraid of ghosts tonight,

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
stay in my room, okay?

398
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,840
Has your leg gotten better now?

399
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,760
It's gotten way better now.

400
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Wait here, okay?

401
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,960
Cause no trouble, alright?

402
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,840
What are you doing, Phloeng?

403
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Stay still.

404
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,440
I can do it myself, you know?

405
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,560
Don't move.

406
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,320
I don't want to bother you.

407
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,360
Let me do it myself.

408
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
If you don't want to bother me,

409
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,480
be careful next time.

410
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
I tried, you see.

411
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,400
Then why did you fall over?

412
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,320
You won't get it.

413
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
And...

414
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
What don't I get?

415
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,720
If you don't believe in ghosts,

416
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
then why are you
making a living off of them?

417
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
Well, it makes me a ton of money.

418
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
I thought
I was going to do it just for fun,

419
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,800
but after a while, people started
enjoying the content,

420
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,560
which earned me a fortune.

421
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
We all love money, don't we?

422
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
I see.

423
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
But...

424
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

425
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,760
You're a host of a ghost show
who doesn't believe in ghosts,

426
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,920
and here you are,
making a career out of them.

427
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Well...

428
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I see it

429
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
as listening to horror fiction.

430
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,680
But what they told you

431
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
wasn't fictional, Phloeng.

432
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,800
How can you be sure

433
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
that it wasn't just fantasy?

434
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Ghosts are real.

435
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,480
If they are,

436
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
show them to me, Master.

437
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
Excuse me...

438
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
What are you looking at?

439
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,200
Do you want to make merit?

440
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,480
Are you asking me to go on a date?

441
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,560
Not that.

442
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I accept.

443
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
Just tell me the date, okay?

444
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,680
Excuse me...

445
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,640
Hey, Yok...

446
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,640
Uh...

447
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,720
I still can't bring myself
to tell your father about you.

448
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm afraid that he'd get mad.

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,680
He won't. He's a kind man.

450
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,680
How about this?

451
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm taking your father
to make merit.

452
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
He'll make merit for you.

453
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
I'll get to do it for you as well.

454
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,560
We'll make a lot of merit for you.

455
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,880
I'll also offer you dolls, toys,

456
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
and tasty treats.

457
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,000
This way, you'll receive
both merit and toys.

458
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,240
Is that okay?

459
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
I accept your offer!

460
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,720
(Tul: Master, are you okay?)

461
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,080
(Tul: You're probably busy, right?)

462
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,840
(Tul: Leaving me on read?
(Good night, then)

463
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,360
Hello, Master.

464
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,080
Do you feel better now?

465
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm alright.

466
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,120
You're still awake, Tul?

467
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,560
I am.

468
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,280
I'm actually at the office.

469
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,920
You should get some rest.

470
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,680
You go and get some rest, Master.

471
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Rest well, okay?

472
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,120
We've got a show
to work on tomorrow.

473
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Right.

474
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
How is he?

475
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
You...

476
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,920
Are you two still friends?

477
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Of course, we are.

478
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
Why did you ask me that?

479
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,680
You seem like
you don't care about him at all.

480
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,640
It's not that I don't.

481
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,920
He says that
he doesn't want to see anybody.

482
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,640
Also, you called me here.

483
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
I'm no longer interested in you.

484
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm going to claim Win as mine.

485
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,400
Good for you.

486
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,240
You're actually not that hot,
you know?

487
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,400
And you said
you're no longer interested in me.

488
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Come on in.

489
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,720
Whoa! Phloeng!

490
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,920
Why did you open the door
without pants on?

491
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,200
What?

492
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Who would've known?

493
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,600
I didn't know that
you were barely dressed.

494
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Is that so?

495
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,120
I thought you wanted
to look at my chest,

496
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,520
so I opened the door.

497
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,720
It's not like that.

498
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,360
You...

499
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,920
You actually looked?

500
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,560
I...

501
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,040
Go and wait downstairs.

502
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,640
I'll cook something for you.

503
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,600
I just want

504
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
a cup of instant noodles
and hot water.

505
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,680
Gosh...

506
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,680
I don't have junk food like that.

507
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Here you go.

508
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,000
You can go and rest.

509
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,600
I'll wash the dish myself.

510
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,440
Whoa.

511
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,200
You're dismissing me
after getting the food?

512
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm not.

513
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
It's almost two in the morning.

514
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,480
I've already caused you trouble
for the whole day.

515
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
It's fine.

516
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,280
I'll just play
video games while I wait.

517
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,920
Thank you

518
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,320
for letting me stay here.

519
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Right.

520
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,840
Do you think

521
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,720
it's because of my bad luck year?

522
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,600
If it's your bad luck year,

523
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,000
how come someone else died?

524
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
You've got a point.

525
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,880
People die every day.

526
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,360
As for your bad luck year...

527
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,360
It's just you turning 25.

528
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm 26 now.

529
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,080
Then why are you worried
about having a bad luck year?

530
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,960
Venerable Father said

531
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,400
my bad luck year started
when I turned 26.

532
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,600
It's not considered
a bad luck year, then.

533
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,200
We believe that
it happens at the age of 25.

534
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm done arguing with you.

535
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Done?

536
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,440
You're still awake?

537
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,720
I was waiting for you.

538
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Good night.

539
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Likewise.

540
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,000
With this strong energy,

541
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,640
how am I supposed to fall asleep?

542
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,200
Everything happens

543
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
because of you?

544
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,640
What do you want?

545
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
My life?

546
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Fine.

547
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,920
Gone quiet?

548
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,200
You'll die eventually.

549
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,000
If I have to die,

550
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,280
then you're coming with me!

551
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,360
Whoa, Yok!

552
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,376
Don't show up and sit
at the end of the bed like this.

553
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,240
You woke up late.

554
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,960
Your father's room
is extremely chilly.

555
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And...

556
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
Where is your father?

557
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,640
I don't understand the reading.

558
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,360
However, when The Tower
and The Ten of Swords appear together,

559
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,680
something bad is bound to happen.

560
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,320
(I'm off for work.

561
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,040
Simply reheat the breakfast
I've prepared for you.

562
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,320
See you.
(From Phloengnathitorn)

563
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Phloeng?

564
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,200
Dry your hair first,

565
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
or you'll catch a cold.

566
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I'll be fine.

567
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm in a hurry.

568
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,360
I'll be off soon.

569
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,640
Thank you very much

570
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,760
for allowing me
to spend a night here.

571
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,360
We'll leave together.

572
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,480
We've got a meeting together.

573
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,360
Right.

574
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,080
Go blow-dry your hair.

575
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
What's that noise?

576
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,040
Is it a ghost?

577
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Alright...

578
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,200
Luck hasn't been
on your side, has it?

579
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,360
Me?

580
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,440
About Win...

581
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,960
Should I confess my love to him?

582
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,056
This time,
we're shooting outside the city.

583
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,056
However, we don't know
what province we'll be going to.

584
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,200
This trip of yours...

585
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,360
You will not make it back.

586
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,600
Yesterday, it was Chakart.

587
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,840
Today, it's the housekeeper.

588
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,336
There's no place
to cremate bodies at this rate.

589
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,960
What the hell are you doing?

590
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,600
It's for dealing
with my karmic creditor.

591
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,480
Please let me be yours.

592
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,840
Hatred ceases
by smashing it to bits!

593
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,760
You have nothing left.

594
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,200
I think...

595
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,720
I've found my karmic creditor.

596
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Is it the work of destiny or fate?

597
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,920
I have no choice but to accept it

598
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,040
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

599
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,880
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

600
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,520
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

601
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,880
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
