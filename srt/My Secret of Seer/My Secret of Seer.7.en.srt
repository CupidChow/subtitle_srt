Ple hasn't been following us, Win.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Right?

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,120
Where did he go?

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh?

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
What?!

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
Namo!

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
What the hell?!

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,240
Tong, what the f*ck
is wrong with you?!

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,960
Hey! Win!

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
Wait! Win!

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Win!

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Win, are you alright?

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Win!

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
Tong, what the f*ck
has gotten into you?

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
If you see
a suspicious-looking idol,

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,160
destroy it.

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,640
Tong, what is wrong with you?

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,760
Hand it over!

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Tong!

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
What the f*ck?

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Win!

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
Win, are you alright?

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Hey, let me out!

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
Let me the f*ck out!

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
Or else I'll curse you!

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Namo!

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Do you believe in ghosts?

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I don't.

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Why?

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,800
I just want to try something.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Get up!

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,280
What are you doing?

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,160
Making both of us happy.

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Which page?

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Hold on.

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
This one.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Dark magic?

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,400
Copy the pattern.

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,120
Why are we doing this?

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,800
To make our wish come true.

53
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,800
What did you wish for?

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
For us to be together.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
Being together

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,880
without Dad?

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,080
You know that
if he finds out about us,

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
he'll separate us, don't you?

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
Come on. Let's finish this already.

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,640
Open the godd*mn door!

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,920
Come on!

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Hey!

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Please stop.

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,120
We're almost there.

65
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
One more time.

66
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,680
Nothing happened.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,720
What's wrong with Dad?

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I don't know.

69
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
His arrival is near.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
His arrival is near.

71
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,160
His arrival is near.

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,800
His arrival is near.

73
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
His arrival is near.

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Hey!

75
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,240
His arrival is near.

76
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Let go!

77
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,640
His arrival is near.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
His arrival is near.

79
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,760
His arrival is near.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
His arrival is near.

81
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
His arrival is near.

82
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
Hands off!

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,576
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

84
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,640
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near.

88
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Sh*t!

89
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Where's Master Win?

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,000
He's upstairs.

91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Win!

92
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Win!

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Where's Master?

94
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,480
He's inside.

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
It's locked shut.

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Win!

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Win.

98
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
Phloeng?!

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm scared.

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
It's okay.

101
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
You're fine now, Win.

102
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Win...

103
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,560
He fell asleep.

104
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,560
At any rate,
please check up on him, Namo.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
If he doesn't improve tomorrow,
we'll take him to the hospital.

106
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
What can we do?

107
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,480
If it's not urgent,
it's better for him to rest here.

108
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,080
Things could get worse.

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
What if he dies?

110
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm going to contact
the nearest hospital for now.

111
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,960
- Right. Thank you.
- No problem.

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm fine now, Namo.

113
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,240
Get well soon, Win.

114
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Am I dreaming?

115
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
Isn't this too much?

116
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,640
What will you do
if he goes into shock?

117
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Can you take responsibility?

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Come on, Phloeng.

119
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,800
You saw that we tried
to make everything safe, didn't you?

120
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Well, was it that safe?

121
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,160
You think it's safe?
He was crying and panicking!

122
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,000
We don't even know
what his mental state is right now.

123
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
So much for safety.

124
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
Who knew he'd be scared
of ghosts this much?

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
He's usually a funny guy.

126
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,640
I was going to make it
into a fun edit.

127
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,320
If it's supposed to be funny,

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,920
both sides have to enjoy it.

129
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,080
But it was only you guys
who found it funny.

130
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,800
You guys are being a**holes.

131
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
Why do you
have to be this upset, Phloeng?

132
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
Is it because I didn't tell you?

133
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
I just want his genuine reaction.

134
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,120
Who gives a sh*t
if you didn't tell me that?

135
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,720
What bugs me
is this scummy prank on him.

136
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Uh, let's just say...

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm sorry on everyone's behalf.

138
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
After this trip...

140
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Your bonus,

141
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
trip,

142
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
and any annual occasion

143
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
are revoked.

144
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,920
- What?!
- No!

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,600
- Tul...
- For real?

146
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,640
If you've got any problem,

147
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,040
feel free to talk to me in private.

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Phloeng,

149
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
nobody wanted this to happen.

150
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,520
Win told me that

151
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,760
when he was little,

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,040
Waew took him to see
his relatives outside the city.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,120
His parents had already passed away
at that time.

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,400
And he went through
something similar.

155
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
What happened?

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
His aunt's son

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,040
tricked him and locked him
inside a crematory.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,320
I never knew this.

159
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
It was horrible.

160
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,480
It was such a horrendous experience.

161
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,880
By the time Waew found him,

162
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,600
he was completely dazed.

163
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,320
So he had to visit
a psychiatrist at a very young age.

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
By the time he recovered,

165
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,360
he was already in high school.

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,880
Even though he claims
his mental state is back to normal,

167
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,720
a trauma is still a trauma.

168
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Even though he understood it,

169
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,000
forgave the person,

170
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720
and moved on,

171
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,760
the scar never went away.

172
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Yet, the one who did it didn't feel
any kind of remorse.

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm really sorry
on behalf of the crew.

174
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,360
Had we known this sooner...

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,240
What the hell happened?

176
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Win.

177
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
I didn't mean to do it.

178
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,200
What are you sorry for?

179
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
Everything,

180
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,160
including how we convinced him
to come on this trip.

181
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm also at fault.

182
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320
I begged him to be on this trip.

183
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Right.

184
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,400
Next, about how he was tricked
into going to the abandoned house.

185
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,520
You didn't know about that,

186
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
so it's not your fault.

187
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm sorry
because I had my suspicions.

188
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,360
Nokphaeng was going to do
something strange,

189
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,360
but I didn't stop him

190
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,520
since weird stuff keeps happening
at our company.

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
Is there anything else
you're sorry about?

192
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm sorry for getting there late.

193
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,680
If I were to arrive there sooner,

194
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
I might've been able to stop them.

195
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Right. I accept your apology.

196
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Try apologizing to him
after he wakes up.

197
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
What are you doing?

198
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Tul?

199
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
This box...

200
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
You didn't give it to Win,

201
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,520
yet you're going to burn it?

202
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
I'll get him what's inside the box.

203
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,520
You tricked both Win

204
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,080
and me.

205
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,480
Just what do you want?

206
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,280
What are you saying?

207
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Go back to bed already.

208
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,160
I'm tired.

209
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Wait.

210
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
If you leave,

211
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
I'll tell him that

212
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,920
you tricked him.

213
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,760
Tell him or not,

214
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,440
he already knows the truth.

215
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
I told you
I didn't know what I was doing.

216
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
You only think
I'm just tricking you and Win.

217
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,800
No matter what I say,
you still won't love me.

218
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Tong.

219
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,520
Phloeng, you don't believe
in ghosts, do you?

220
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,760
However, Win is different
from those who are afraid of ghosts.

221
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,280
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

222
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,280
You're saying that he saw ghosts

223
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
in that house?

224
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
I can't answer that for him.

225
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,760
But it wouldn't hurt
to believe a little.

226
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,520
Hey! What is Win doing?!

227
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,920
- Hey, Master!
- Sh*t!

228
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Please don't jump, Master!

229
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,400
- Master!
- Hey, Win!

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Master!

231
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Master!

232
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Master.

233
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Master.

234
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,120
- Sh*t! Win!
- Master!
- Master!
- Master!

235
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,136
- What are you doing?!
- What's wrong, Master?

236
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,960
What happened?

237
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,360
- I don't know!
- Win, let him go.

238
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,360
- Let him go!
- Let him go!

239
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:40,559
- Master!
- Stop!

240
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,080
- Master!
- Let go of him!

241
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
- Master!
- Master!

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Master.

243
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Win!

244
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Why are you like this, Master?!

245
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Let go!

246
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
What is wrong with you, Win?

247
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Let go...

248
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,160
I can't. He's choking him hard.

249
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,040
Where is his strength coming from?

250
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,240
I don't know!

251
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,840
Tong, what did you do to him?

252
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,400
- Let go.
- Master...

253
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,760
Are you ready?

254
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,240
Are you ready?!

255
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,440
Let me go!

256
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Master!

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,680
Hey, Tong!

258
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Get the Buddha image.

259
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
- Let go.
- Let him go.

260
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,616
- Phloeng, are you still good?
- Calm down, Master.

261
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Let him go, Master!

262
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
Win, pull yourself together!

263
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Master!

264
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
- Master!
- Let him go!

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,080
- Master!
- Let go, Master!

266
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Win!

267
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Hello?

268
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,920
Hello, Wayu.

269
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,440
Win...

270
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
It's happening to Win again!

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Is Phloeng with him?

272
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,320
He is.

273
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,680
An ambulance is going to take him
to the hospital soon.

274
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't take him there.

275
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
Bring Win to my house right now.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Your house?

277
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,800
Are you ready?

278
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,800
Are you ready?!

279
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah!

280
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm f*cking ready!

281
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
Sleep.

282
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,520
Go to sleep!

283
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,120
What the hell do you want?

284
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Who are you?

285
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
I already made merit for you.

286
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,920
Pretentious.

287
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,560
You only prayed for yourself.

288
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,560
I do not need such merit, either.

289
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,240
It's f*cking worthless!

290
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,200
Then what do you want?

291
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,160
I'll never tell you.

292
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,280
If I do,

293
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll be left in ruin.

294
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Fine.

295
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
What does this mean?

296
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,160
Sleep.

297
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
No!

298
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
Explain yourself.

299
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Win, you finally woke up?!

300
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Namo?

301
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
What is wrong with you?

302
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,520
You're acting as if someone died.

303
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,056
I thought you were f*cking dead!

304
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
Don't be so rude right now.

305
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
Am I dead?

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You're not!

307
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Let me see.

308
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
How are you doing?

309
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,640
Are you hurt?

310
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
And...

311
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,760
What is this place?

312
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
It's Elder Master Phupha's house.

313
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,840
Elder Master Phupha's house?

314
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Yeah.

315
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
Elder Master Phupha's house.

316
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
Is it, like,

317
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
a medium's house?

318
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Of course.

319
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
This place emits
very friendly and safe energy.

320
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
And...

321
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,040
Who is this Elder Master Phupha?

322
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,320
He's Phloeng's grandfather.

323
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
And...

324
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,640
Whose room is this?

325
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,480
Who changed my clothes?

326
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
This is Phloeng's room,

327
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
and he was the one
who changed your clothes.

328
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
He put on new clothes for me?

329
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Yes, he did.

330
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
Why...

331
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,560
Why can't I recall anything?

332
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,480
You were possessed.

333
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Possessed?

334
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,120
Don't tell me that back there...

335
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,680
I remember falling into a place.

336
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,840
My karmic creditor
also looked just like me.

337
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,680
After that,
I can't remember anything else.

338
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
You woke up
in the middle of the night,

339
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,560
trying to jump off the second floor
of the pool villa.

340
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,720
Was I trying to do that?

341
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
I can't remember that I was.

342
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
You were.

343
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
Fortunately,
Phloeng pulled you back,

344
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,320
or else you would've fallen
to your death.

345
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,320
You even made sure
you'd land headfirst.

346
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,200
That would've either killed
or broken you.

347
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
And...

348
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,120
What else?

349
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
Here.

350
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,600
See this?

351
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Sh*t...

352
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,000
I did that?

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Yes, d*mn it.

354
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
You didn't hold back.

355
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Your voice was also so deep
as if you were sick.

356
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,680
However, you screamed
as loudly as a ghost's screech.

357
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Sh*t...

358
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,080
How did you bring me to this house?

359
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Gosh.

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
You don't need to know how.

361
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,200
Just know that Phloeng hugged
you for the whole night.

362
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,080
Did he?!

363
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Yeah.

364
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,120
He was the only person
to watch over you the entire night.

365
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
I was there, too,
but in the distance.

366
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,400
I love you, but...

367
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,360
I also love my own life.

368
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,560
Still, I was the one
who called Wayu,

369
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,360
and he told me to get you
to the house to perform a ritual

370
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
immediately.

371
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,040
If it were more than 24 hours later,
you would've died.

372
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,440
Does Phloeng
believe in all of this?

373
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
F*ck no.

374
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,720
He's so d*mn stubborn,

375
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
claiming you caught
a disease in the woods,

376
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
like a fungus
that affects your brain.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,760
In the end, we brought you here

378
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,440
because you were acting out.

379
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,200
So it's you?!

380
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,320
Ow, Win?!

381
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,960
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

382
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
Let go!

383
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm going to kill him!

384
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,080
It was terrifying, d*mn it.

385
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Fortunately, we managed to bring
you to the house just in time.

386
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,960
Hands off!

387
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Then, he performed a ritual on you.

388
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,920
Also, did you know that

389
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,440
since the incident occurred,

390
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
Phloeng hasn't returned
to the company?

391
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
What?

392
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Seriously?

393
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Yeah.

394
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
Nokphaeng called me, begging me

395
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,600
to convince him to return.

396
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,560
He said the company is in shambles

397
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
because they have no host
for the show.

398
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
It's so confusing to me.

399
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm not that close to Phloeng.

400
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,960
If he wants you to do the job,
then that'd sound reasonable.

401
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,640
I feel so guilty right now.

402
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,040
Should I give him an offering set?

403
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,560
He's the one
who needs to offer it to you.

404
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,120
I've spoken to Wayu.

405
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,720
He said things
wouldn't have gone this badly

406
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,280
if the sh*tty crew

407
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,440
hadn't brought you
to the haunted house.

408
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,600
Moreover, you actually saw
ghosts there,

409
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
and Tong was also possessed.

410
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,440
It's a good thing
that I saved him in time.

411
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Tong?

412
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah.

413
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,720
I broke the idol
that he always carried with him.

414
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,400
I've also heard that
he's burned the stuff he was given.

415
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,400
Welcome back.

416
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Win,

417
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
eat well, dear.

418
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you.

419
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
Uh, Elder...

420
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,760
How long do I have to stay here?

421
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,240
Until the night
of the winter solstice.

422
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm going to perform
the cleansing ritual on you.

423
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
The winter solstice?

424
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,160
That's like weeks away, isn't it?

425
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,679
Elder Master, who is it

426
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,200
that is trying to claim Win's life?

427
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,320
I do not know, actually.

428
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,400
However, this person's power
is immense.

429
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,600
Someone is behind this?

430
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,240
I always thought it was a ghost.

431
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm still unable
to confirm on that.

432
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Whether it's a person or not,

433
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
it is certainly elusive.

434
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,760
However, we'll soon find out
who it is.

435
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,920
Right now,

436
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
do not leave the house, dear.

437
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,840
If someone calls you,

438
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,480
do not go out or answer the call.

439
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,680
You must not.

440
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,800
This is very important.

441
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
This includes

442
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,800
those I know, too?

443
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,040
Most certainly.

444
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Don't look so shocked.

445
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,920
Why do you have to be so scared?

446
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,680
You're with Wayu and me.

447
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,560
Phloeng is also here.

448
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,240
You know that each of my grandsons

449
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,960
is not just a nobody.

450
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,800
They can certainly help you, Win.

451
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,200
Eat up.

452
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Don't listen to his words too much.

453
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,560
You've never changed, Phloeng.

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
You're always a contrarian,

455
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,720
opposing everything.

456
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,200
Just eat up, Grandpa.

457
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
Right. Thanks.

458
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,120
Would you like the fish head?

459
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,440
Its bones
are going to choke me to death.

460
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Come on, now.

461
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
What?

462
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,520
Tell me.

463
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,440
How did you know Wayu?

464
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,720
I just know that
he's Phloeng's younger brother.

465
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Liar.

466
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,840
I can sense a liar.

467
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,120
Your sensing power is back,
all of a sudden?

468
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Whatever.

469
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,760
Just tell me

470
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
how you got to know him.

471
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,880
Yeah, we knew
each other well before.

472
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,600
We met at the same self-care course.

473
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,560
When was that?

474
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,840
A year ago, maybe.

475
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Whoa.

476
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
And...

477
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
And you chose to hide it from me?

478
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,760
Well, you didn't ask me anything.

479
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,520
You have a crush on him?

480
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm going to kick your a**.

481
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,880
He's a medium, alright?

482
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,000
He's the Elder Master's successor
who now possesses his powers.

483
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,600
If I were to date him,

484
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,480
wouldn't it be a bit weird?

485
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,840
When making love with him,

486
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,040
I wouldn't know
who I was really with:

487
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,920
Wayu or Elder Master's spirit.

488
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,000
Gosh, Namo.

489
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
I just asked you a question.

490
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
And you're taking it that far?

491
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,240
How does that question
do you any good?

492
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,960
Where is your luggage?

493
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,120
What luggage?

494
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
For your clothes.

495
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
I checked the closet,

496
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
but I didn't see any.

497
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,240
You're going to wear my clothes?

498
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,720
Who says that
I'm staying here with you?

499
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,920
What?

500
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,520
You were sleeping for three days.

501
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,960
Why should you be scared now?

502
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
Well...

503
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
I was unconscious
during those three days.

504
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Phloeng has been staying with you.

505
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Are you satisfied now?

506
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,480
Sh*t!

507
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Win...

508
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,640
Remember this.

509
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,160
No matter what happens,

510
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,080
always tell Phloeng
to wear a condom.

511
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Understood?

512
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,840
How dirty-minded.

513
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Safety first, you know?

514
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Is it awkward?

515
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
No, it isn't.

516
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
Why did you bring me here?

517
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,880
Doctors couldn't find a cure,

518
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,520
so it's time to turn to shamans.

519
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,400
This means...

520
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,120
Deep down,
you do believe ghosts exist?

521
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,160
I don't, actually.

522
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
And...

523
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,840
How would you explain
everything that happened?

524
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
A bug bite.

525
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Exotic diseases.

526
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,800
Struck by a poisonous plant.

527
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,896
Either those,
or it might be a mental illness,

528
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
caused by being left stranded
in an abandoned house.

529
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,560
If that's the case,
shouldn't I go see a doctor?

530
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,680
If they can't find a cure,

531
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,680
we have to rely on
the alternatives.

532
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,640
My grandpa
studied traditional Thai medicine

533
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
in case you didn't know.

534
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,600
Even though he can't perform surgery
or major procedures,

535
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,200
he can prescribe herbal medicine.

536
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,800
Rumors claim that he's a shaman,

537
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,400
but it's not true.

538
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,440
He simply

539
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,320
prescribes
herbal medicine accordingly.

540
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
On top of that,
he knows how to persuade people.

541
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,160
That's why he became a medium.

542
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,440
That's how there are rumors
claiming that he has powers.

543
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
But...

544
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Elder Master
told me himself that...

545
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,680
he is a medium,

546
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,280
and he has Wayu as his successor.

547
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,760
Have you really seen
his powers, though?

548
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,760
You're disrespecting him.

549
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm not.

550
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,256
Just make me see them in person,

551
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
so I can believe him.

552
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And...

553
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Why do I have to stay until
the night of the winter solstice?

554
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,000
Well, it aligns
with medical procedures, doesn't it?

555
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,200
Sickness needs to be treated.

556
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,760
Then close observation
of symptoms is required.

557
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,000
But you're staying at my house
instead of a hospital.

558
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,800
He once made a prophecy, though,

559
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,680
that we were meant to be together.

560
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
So...

561
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
He's also a fortune teller?

562
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,480
Not exactly.

563
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,920
But he once told me that

564
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
we made a vow in our first lives.

565
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,160
In the next lives,

566
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,800
it's as if we were bound
by its consequences,

567
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,840
except in our previous lives.

568
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
What happened
to our previous lives?

569
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,640
We weren't together.

570
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,240
Why was that?

571
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,960
He said that
one of us died early on.

572
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,960
He didn't specify who it was.

573
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
All he knew was that
the one left alive was in sorrow,

574
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,040
making another vow:

575
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,616
If we were to see each other
in the next life,

576
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,000
we would never let each other go.

577
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,640
Do you believe in the prophecy?

578
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,760
If you do,

579
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,080
you need theories
to back up your claim.

580
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,720
I do have a theory, though.

581
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
What is it?

582
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,960
Date me.

583
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Ridiculous.

584
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,656
You're making
that chubby face again.

585
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
It's not chubby.

586
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well...

587
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
This is just an example.

588
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
If I were to die tomorrow,

589
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
can I try something right now?

590
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,320
It may sound a bit weird,

591
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
but ever since I was born,

592
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,720
I've never kissed anyone before.

593
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,360
You want to kiss me?

594
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
No.

595
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,480
I said "anyone."

596
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,000
Can that be me?

597
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,880
Spirits are wandering
outside the perimeter.

598
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,640
Oh, Yok?

599
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,560
How are you doing?

600
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,880
It's been so long.

601
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,440
Do you miss me?

602
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,200
What's the matter?

603
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,960
Are you mad at me?

604
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,520
I'm sorry that
I haven't helped you.

605
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
How about this?

606
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,200
If I get to meet Phloeng today,

607
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,920
I'll talk him through it.

608
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
Okay?

609
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Nonsense.

610
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Buy me the latest Gunpla first.

611
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Sure.

612
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
I'll order one via a shopping app.

613
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,040
If I do, you'll stop
being mad at me, right?

614
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,920
I want the snack
with shells and filling, too.

615
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,440
What kind of snack is that?

616
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,240
I don't know.

617
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,960
The one
with colorful shells and filling.

618
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
Colorful shells?

619
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,720
With filling?

620
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Is it...

621
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh!

622
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Macarons?

623
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,160
Sure.

624
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
I'll treat you to them.

625
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Would you like anything else?

626
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I want...

627
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,520
Petch, what are you doing?!

628
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,200
Why are you messing around here?

629
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,280
Go and help your father!

630
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Petch?

631
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,360
Yes, his name is Petch.

632
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,040
His name isn't Yok.

633
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,480
I deserve
to be struck down, Master.

634
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
We're sorry, Master.

635
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,040
Just let it be.

636
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,120
It's already been a while.

637
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
If Win actually died back there,

638
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,840
I'd sue your company
until it went bankrupt.

639
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,880
Please, Namo...

640
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,880
We were also in shock back then.

641
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,800
I didn't expect we'd make it.

642
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,920
It's true.

643
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,800
I even thought that
if Phloeng got taken out,

644
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,600
the next ones would be Nokphaeng

645
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
and me.

646
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,440
Have you fully recovered, Master?

647
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Did Elder Master tell you
what happened to you?

648
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh...

649
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,560
I'm fine now.

650
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,400
Maybe it was because of the ghosts
at the abandoned house.

651
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,000
See? I told you, Nokphaeng.

652
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,200
Everyone in that house
was murdered.

653
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,040
The locals
have been trying to hide the truth.

654
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,440
Please accept this, Master.

655
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,600
It's our apology.

656
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,559
Tul didn't come here by himself,

657
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,480
so he had us bring you
this money as a consolation.

658
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
We're truly sorry, Master.

659
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
It's okay, really.

660
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Let's just say I've forgiven you.

661
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Whatever.

662
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,640
I refuse to forgive you guys.

663
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Win never gets mad at other people.

664
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,760
Just think about it.

665
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,336
If he jumped
off the balcony to his death

666
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,760
while possessed,

667
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
what would you do?

668
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,520
Please, Namo...

669
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,000
Please don't take
this matter to court.

670
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,720
We'll do anything you ask.

671
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But please...

672
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
We sincerely apologize.

673
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Well then...

674
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
The consolation money
should've been tripled.

675
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
That's my line.

676
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,320
- Tripled?
- Tripled?

677
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Tong?

678
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
Are you good now?

679
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Mm.

680
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm so sorry.

681
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,760
I didn't know stuff like that
would happen.

682
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
And...

683
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,880
Tul got this for you.

684
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,240
I never had a chance
to give it to you.

685
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,280
I didn't know what I was doing.

686
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,400
I used that stuff
because I wanted a partner.

687
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
I'm really sorry.

688
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,560
It's going to take a while.

689
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
Still, thank you.

690
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Mm.

691
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Win...

692
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,440
I think we're set for life.

693
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,920
I can sense a scammer.

694
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,840
What scammer?

695
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,320
It's the consolation money.

696
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,440
This is good, though.

697
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
We're still working
with Nokphaeng either way.

698
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,080
So, about you and Phloeng.

699
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
How is it going?

700
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,200
You're asking about him and me?

701
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,200
Well, what about you and Wayu?

702
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
What?

703
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,560
I can sense puppy love.

704
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Liar!

705
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,600
You're talking out of your a**.

706
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,800
Anyway, come and stay here
for a few nights when you're free.

707
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,280
Fine. I'll come
and hang out with you,

708
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,600
but you have to let me
do my funeral stuff, too.

709
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,360
If anything comes up,

710
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,600
just call me, okay?

711
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Oh.

712
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,560
Tong got me stuff from Tul.

713
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,480
I don't think he meant to do it.

714
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,400
It's a bit hard to say right now.

715
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Mm.

716
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,720
I guess time will tell.

717
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Mm.

718
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
I need to make up my mind first.

719
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,960
I'll talk to him later.

720
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,240
I'll be seeing you, then.

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
I have to go now.

722
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,800
Excuse me...

723
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,880
Dad is calling you for a meal.

724
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
See you.

725
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,120
Win!

726
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Win!

727
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,080
What the hell is it?

728
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,480
I forgot my phone.

729
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,920
Can you go get it for me?

730
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,240
I'm too far out to do it myself.

731
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Where is it?

732
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,640
In the house.

733
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,680
Eung's probably yelling
at me right now.

734
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I'm running late now!

735
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,600
Right. Wait there.

736
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I'll go get it.

737
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Win!

738
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
Come on! It's getting hot out here.

739
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Right!

740
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Quickly!

741
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Win.

742
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,440
What the hell is this?

743
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,200
Are you for real?

744
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
Come to me.

745
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Go away!

746
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,760
Don't get any closer!

747
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Who were you talking to?

748
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,840
Why are you holding a leaf?

749
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Sh*t...

750
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
I forgot.

751
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,560
The real Namo
has the scent of stamens

752
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,680
and the scent of a leather jacket.

753
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Why is that important?

754
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
And who were you talking to?

755
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
It was Namo.

756
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,200
Win, are you ready?

757
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,680
Perhaps what you're dealing with

758
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,400
may not simply be ghosts
or a karmic creditor.

759
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Win!

760
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Save me!

761
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,919
Once you find me,

762
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,040
the ritual of spirit transfer
shall end.

763
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
Hey, let go!

764
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,520
Win, what's wrong?

765
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,600
He's fighting.

766
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,520
To fully possess someone,

767
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,960
the body must not have
its soul attached to it.

768
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,440
This means that
the host must die first!

769
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Win!

770
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,720
Win!

771
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Wake up!

772
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,880
Is it the work of destiny or fate?

773
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,200
I have no choice but to accept it

774
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,960
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

775
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,720
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

776
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,120
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

777
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,400
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
