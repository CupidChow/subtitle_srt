One, two, and three!

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
- Smile a bit more.
- Hey.

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,616
Do I look good? Focus harder, dmn it.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,880
I know. Smile!

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Hey.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Can you help me take a photo?

18
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you believe in destiny?

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
This was my first time

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,080
that I got to meet

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Win.

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
My grandpa called this encounter

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
"destiny."

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
However, I came to the conclusion

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
that it was just a coincidence.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,120
A love that spans every lifetime

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,440
is nonsense.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
There's no such thing.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
It's all just a massive coincidence,

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
just an occurrence.

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Things should've ended there

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
at our second coincidental encounter.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,800
This was our third encounter.

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
I don't believe in merit and fortune.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
They're nonsensical to me.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,320
They're outside scientific boundaries.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,240
Yet, I couldn't find a way
to object to my grandpa's reading.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,760
Even though I tried
not to believe in destiny,

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
I couldn't just stand

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
to see the one in front of me in peril.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
You've got feelings for me, Master?

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Who says that I have?

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,400
I just want to talk to you

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
about the work.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
Yes, the work.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,800
You were staring at me
for minutes, though.

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Well...

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,840
If you knew,
then why didn't you say anything?

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
I saw you staring down at my chest,

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
and I was curious
about what you'd do next.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Nuts!

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,520
You pervert. I wasn't doing that.

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm going to tell everyone
you stared at my chest.

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Hey!

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,200
Stop it, Phloeng.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
I didn't stare at your chest.

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Help!

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,920
This pervert of a seer
was staring at my chest!

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
I wasn't doing that!

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,760
What's with you?

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Oh, Master?

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
I've got something
to talk to Phloeng.

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Feel free.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
What is it?

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
It's nothing now.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
I'd like to talk to Master,

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,440
now that he's here.

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
You can talk here.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
Aren't you supposed
to be on the podcast?

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Of course.

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm going there with Master.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Well...

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,440
Master, do you have time
for a meal with me?

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
He doesn't.

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
He needs to have his makeup done.

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Have a meal in the changing room.

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Here you go.

78
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,360
Whoa!

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
Our boss is so generous today.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Is this due to a special occasion
or something?

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,520
I noticed you guys
were in a hurry for the show.

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
I was worried
you might've to skip a meal.

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Sheesh.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,280
Our boss is both handsome

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
and generous, right?

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
You two have amazing skin,

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,160
both Phloeng

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,360
and Master Win.

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
What skincare product do you use?

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll look for it the moment you tell me.

91
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,520
I forgot its name, actually.

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Namo usually gets it for me.

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Once I'm home,
I'll send you photos of it, okay?

94
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
No problem.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
What about you, Phloeng?

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,520
Your complexion is very smooth.

97
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
I simply wash it with water.

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,480
Whoa!

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
What are you looking at?

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Nothing.

101
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
If you want to stare at my chest,

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
just ask.

103
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Here you go.

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
This one is yours, Win.

105
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Thank you.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
What about mine?

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Yours?

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I've got none.

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
The auspicious
Golden Dragon facial features...

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Born with abundant fortune
and blessings...

111
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,320
The guest is here, Phloeng.

112
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Well...

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
I'll give you guys a quick briefing,

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,320
so Master is on the same page.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,920
Today's guest is Chai.

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Hello, Master.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,120
- Hello, Phloeng.
- Hello.

118
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,080
Is...

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,600
Is he related to a royal family?

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, no, Master.

121
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,080
Chai is his name, not "Prince" in Thai.

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
You're quite comedic, aren't you?

123
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,280
Chai is going to share his experience

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
about his bad luck year.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,320
What about his bad luck year?

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
He'd been seeing ghosts
that entire year,

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,040
and he's going to talk about it today.

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
That's it.

129
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Hey, you.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Whoa!

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
Yes?

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Visiting the building?

133
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Yes, I am.

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Let me go in for a while.

135
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Go in?

136
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes, I'm about to go in.

137
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Hey, what's up?

138
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,280
I've arrived and am about to go inside.

139
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Okay. Be seeing you.

140
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
What the hell?

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
The seating should do the trick.

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,320
As for the lighting, it's all good now.

143
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
I think we're good to go.

144
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
My apologies.

145
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,200
- I think this is alright.
- I'm Win's friend.

146
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Right.

147
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Are we good?

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,960
- Yes, we're ready to roll.
- Go for it.

149
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
Shall we start?

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,840
Okay, everybody.

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
If you're ready, let's roll.

153
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
Okay, speed!

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
Hello.

155
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,880
You're watching 'Spooky Hellish Night, '

156
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,360
a fiery night haunted
by horrors of the unknown.

157
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm Phloengnathitorn,

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,000
and I'm joined by the White Knight Seer

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
and our guest for today's horror story,

160
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Chai.

161
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,776
Good to see you, Phloeng and Master.

162
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,640
- Hello.
- Good to see you, too.

163
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's do this.

164
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,400
I've heard that your horror story

165
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
is about your bad luck year?

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,080
That's right, Phloeng.

167
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
It was when I turned exactly 25

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,520
that the bad luck year
manifested itself.

169
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
How long has it been
since your bad luck year?

170
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,240
It's already been
quite a while, actually.

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,560
I was tasked
to oversee a construction site.

172
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,760
I was there
with my two engineering friends.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Chai, I'm here.

174
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,800
Chai, what the fuck are you looking at?

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Guys,

176
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I think it got me.

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,800
What the hell are you on about?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,520
I saw a charred woman.

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
She was smiling at me.

180
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
Are you insane?

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Your brain's fried.

182
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Are you hammered or what?

183
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,200
- No.
- He's not drunk.

184
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
Handsome, a misfortune
is coming your way.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,680
You're 25, aren't you?

186
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Yes.

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,000
You haven't been ordained
for your parents either?

188
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I haven't.

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
Then do so without delay.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
Your misfortune will be eased.

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Do it as soon as you can.

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,160
At least, you should be ordained
for three months.

193
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Three months?

194
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
But I...

195
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
And...

196
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
Did you do it?

197
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,800
I didn't.

198
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,160
If I chose to be ordained,

199
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,536
it'd take up three months of my life,

200
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,760
and that would affect my annual bonus.

201
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I see.

202
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
That's understandable.

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,640
Ordination costs
a lot of money, Phloeng.

204
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,200
One example is my cousin.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,496
He was sent
to be ordained and to study,

206
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,720
but in the end,

207
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,176
he didn't finish his studies.

208
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,560
After that, he became a troublemaker.

209
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,880
He was jobless at the age of 30.

210
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Eventually,

211
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,400
his parents had to send
him a monthly allowance.

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,640
Wouldn't it be better to get a job
and support them instead?

213
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,040
At any rate,

214
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,400
my bad luck year got me good.

215
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Hold on...

216
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
What happened?

217
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Don't tell me that

218
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,440
you're sensing something?

219
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
Is the studio light

220
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,960
going to flicker again?

221
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
Uh...

222
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Not that.

223
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
I need to use the bathroom.

224
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,560
I've been holding it for so long.

225
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,760
I can't hold it any longer.

226
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Huh?

227
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,840
Huh?

228
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm really sorry.

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Please excuse me.

230
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Oh, dear.

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,960
Anybody there?

232
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
Can you pass me some toilet paper?

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,016
Win, why didn't you relieve yourself
before the session?

234
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,720
Everybody else is waiting for you.

235
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
It's Tul's.

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Is he this kind to everyone?

237
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Come on. I'll be done soon, Tong.

238
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,280
Just a second, Tong.

239
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
What the hell?

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,480
That was perfect timing, wasn't it?

241
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
It was.

242
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,400
- Please sit tight.
- Sure, no problem.

243
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Uh...

244
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm truly sorry.

246
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry for wasting everybody's time.

247
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,640
It's nothing, Master.

248
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
Now...

249
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
Please continue, Chai.

250
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh, sure.

251
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
Where were we?

252
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,960
Master Win needed to use the toilet.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,640
Right!

254
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Not that.

255
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Oh.

256
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,200
You were suggested to be ordained.

257
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh, you're right.

258
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
Here's the story, Phloeng.

259
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,160
I see ordination as a belief.

260
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
The term "bad luck year"
has only recently become a trendy word.

261
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm confused as to
why people are so scared by it.

262
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
What about other religions,

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,280
such as Christianity?

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,160
Do I also have to be ordained
and make merit, like in Buddhism?

265
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,440
I think there's a gap in this logic.

266
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,760
- I like your explanation, Chai.
- Thank you.

267
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,240
Unfortunately, my story
didn't end there.

268
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Why is that?

269
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,880
Do you guys remember that I saw

270
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
a woman back there?

271
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,160
I met her again.

272
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Whoa...

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,480
Ow...

274
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Hey, Chai!

275
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,960
- Chai! Are you alright?
- What's wrong?

276
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
- Ow...
- What happened?

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,640
Shit! Your leg is in rough shape.

278
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,960
- Ouch...
- Call rescue services!

279
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
Call them now!

280
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Easy, Chai.

281
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Stay still.

282
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,040
Easy there.

283
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,320
- He's stuck at a site in Min Buri.
- He's bleeding a lot.

284
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
His leg got crushed by steel.

285
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Please come here immediately.

286
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,320
You will not have a peaceful end,

287
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,720
and neither will you!

288
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Why?

289
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
She won't leave you be, Chai.

290
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
Your only way out

291
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,440
is to be ordained as soon as possible.

292
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Do so even with your broken leg.

293
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
If you refuse,

294
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,760
you'll die at the age of 26.

295
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
What?

296
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
26?

297
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,960
Stop reading cards.

298
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
Use your sense

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,520
and find the Radiance of the Seven Gems.

300
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,896
What are you
talking about, fortune teller?

301
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,440
And who is she?

302
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,640
She was your lover in your past life.

303
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Huh?

304
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,640
You shouldn't have promised her love
in every lifetime.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,680
My love from my past life?

306
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,440
In my past life,
I had to work in a different city.

307
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,440
I didn't get to see her for years.

308
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,840
So, I sought someone else.

309
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,680
She was heartbroken when she found out

310
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
and died of grief.

311
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,280
Before she died, she pledged

312
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,040
to relentlessly torment me
in every single lifetime.

313
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,160
My only way out

314
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,920
was to be ordained
to sever the karmic ties.

315
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Whoa...

316
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,640
That's really horrifying.

317
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,360
And...

318
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,840
Have you been ordained?

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,120
I ran out of options,

320
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,400
so I had to be ordained.

321
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,120
I was ordained at a forest monastery.

322
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,880
Nobody was allowed to visit me.

323
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
Alms rounds were forbidden.

324
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,960
I had to stay inside the living quarters
for three months.

325
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,160
I also had to observe the precepts
just like a monk, about 200 of them.

326
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,040
It felt like I was in literal hell.

327
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,960
I was told

328
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
not to leave the living quarters
for three months.

329
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,040
If I left,

330
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,920
she'd take my life,
and I'd be gone for good.

331
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,840
Good job for pulling through.

332
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,440
Thank you.

333
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
There's something I still doubt, though.

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Is the ghost woman gone?

335
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,960
Well then...

336
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,360
Let me take care of your doubt.

337
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Thank you.

338
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
The High Priestess

339
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,560
depicts two sides of emotions.

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
However, in this case,
it might depict the ghost woman.

341
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
As for the Nine of Wands,

342
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,240
a card depicting a man holding a wand,

343
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,880
looking at other wands behind him,

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,920
might represent
the concern and attachment.

345
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,120
As for the last card,

346
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,680
the Judgment,

347
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
it signifies reckoning.

348
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,320
With these three cards combined,
it signifies that

349
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
she's still there.

350
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
She hasn't gone anywhere.

351
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,560
She's there, waiting for you.

352
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
So...

353
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,080
I guess there's nothing you can do

354
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
aside from making merit.

355
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,200
If that doesn't work,

356
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
try...

357
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,920
making merit and dedicating it
to your guardian angel.

358
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,160
This could possibly lift
some of the karma.

359
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
It could also grant you protection

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
so that your guardian angel
could fight back.

361
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,920
Right.

362
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Um...

363
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
Master, you said the same thing as a forest monk.

364
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
The wording is exactly the same.

365
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Whoa.

366
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
Your reading sure is accurate.

367
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,856
- Thank you so much, Master Win.
- Thank you.

368
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,936
Thank you very much, Phloeng.

369
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Thank you.

370
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,880
For today's EP, a big thank you
goes to Master Win and Chai,

371
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,440
for sharing
a horrifying experience with us.

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,960
We hope that

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,120
you'll be free from the karma soon.

374
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Sadhu.

375
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,160
I want to be free
from this so bad myself.

376
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,976
- I hope it happens soon.
- Sure.

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
I'll put Master's suggestions to use.

378
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
- I'll make merit.
- Sure.

379
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,680
I've never seen anything like this.

380
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,160
You're amazing.

381
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,280
You've become more
of an extrovert, you know?

382
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,640
This is enough, Tong.

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's exhausting.

384
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,360
I never knew that
being a celebrity could be this tiring.

385
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Come on.

386
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,080
It's for the money.

387
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Keep that in mind.

388
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,840
Next up on the list,

389
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,640
you have a fortune reading session
for an influential tycoon.

390
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Hold up, Tong.

391
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,960
If there's a problem,

392
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,040
feel free to inform me.

393
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Tul.

394
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes?

395
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Please excuse me.

396
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Thank you.

397
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes, Master?

398
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm giving this back to you.

399
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
I even told Tong not to
tell you whose it is.

400
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,240
He didn't tell me that.

401
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm Master Win after all.

402
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,880
The podcast was such a treat.

403
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
Uh...

404
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
What is it that you want
to talk to me about again?

405
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Oh.

406
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,376
It was about the podcast, actually.

407
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,520
I really want you
to have a dedicated show.

408
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,840
Having a channel would be great.

409
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Well...

410
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm not that confident about the idea.

411
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,160
I did it,
but it didn't have that many views.

412
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,920
So I switched to doing
one-on-one fortune-telling sessions.

413
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
You look cute
doing a livestream, though.

414
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,800
Well, I mean...

415
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,400
How about you do livestreams
on your own channel?

416
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,400
Is it a good idea, Tul?

417
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
It is.

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,640
If you jump to being a show host,
it'd feel a bit awkward.

419
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,520
Sometimes, starting by doing livestreams

420
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,000
on your own

421
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,280
and finding your own style

422
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
is a great idea.

423
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
The thing is that I've tried it,

424
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,640
but it's been on hold right now.

425
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll look into doing that later.

426
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,840
Be confident, Master.

427
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
I'll tune in.

428
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Right.

429
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Phloeng!

430
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,320
I'm heading home now.

431
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
Look at me while talking to me.

432
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,960
Why are you staring at my chest?

433
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm not doing that.

434
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
You didn't forget
to bring your cards today?

435
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,680
Not anymore.

436
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Hey, look out!

437
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Master, watch out!

438
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Master?

439
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Are you alright?

440
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Are you okay, Master?

441
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,040
Right.

442
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm good.

443
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't tell me that

444
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
the reckoning is upon me.

445
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll do it myself.

446
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
It's too troubling for you to do it.

447
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,360
I'll do it for you.

448
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,520
Treat your own wound first.
You've got scratches, too.

449
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
Here. Let me do it.

450
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,080
No need. I'll do it.

451
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,880
Please!

452
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
That's enough.

453
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
That's it, correct?

454
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Thank you, both of you.

455
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
I have to get going now.

456
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Let's go, Tong.

457
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,960
Let's head back to our place.

458
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,800
Here.

459
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,160
Treat your own wound.

460
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Namo.

461
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,680
You wouldn't believe

462
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,240
what I've experienced.

463
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Why?

464
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
A chest?

465
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,680
Tong told me
you were talking to Phloeng.

466
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,040
It was about his chest, right?

467
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,760
No, it wasn't me.

468
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,800
It's not that!

469
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,040
Out of the blue,

470
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,040
a potted plant
almost dropped on my head.

471
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Fortunately,

472
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Phloeng and Tul saved me,

473
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,400
or else I would've kicked the bucket.

474
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,600
I think...

475
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,320
It's coming for me,

476
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
my bad luck year.

477
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,840
Bad luck year, my ass.

478
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,600
For once, look at things
from a scientific perspective.

479
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,520
Is someone
who is eager to see ghosts like you

480
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,000
really allowed to say that?

481
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
Ghosts are science-related!

482
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
It's just that they can't be proven yet.

483
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,920
Do you know
the term "unverified assumption"?

484
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,480
Let's just say that, for now,

485
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,640
I want you guys to spend
a few nights with me.

486
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,800
I've been seeing stuff lately.

487
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,920
What stuff are you talking about?

488
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,880
I feel like I've been able
to connect to something.

489
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
I don't know if it's true
or my imagination.

490
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You...

491
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,040
You've obtained another superpower?

492
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
I've heard that

493
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,520
people who will die soon

494
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,240
will have more powers.

495
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Is that so?

496
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,880
I've read it in a book.

497
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,280
Right. Whatever.

498
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,520
Please come and spend your nights here.

499
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,360
Come on.

500
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,216
I've always been there with you so much

501
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,160
that my dad thinks I'm dating you.

502
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,200
Just tell him that you are.

503
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm a top.

504
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,880
Nope.

505
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm a top.

506
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,720
We'll take turns. That's it.

507
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,976
Tong will be a bottom, okay?

508
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
Gosh! This is disgusting!

509
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,880
Don't talk about this
anywhere else, okay?

510
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,960
People would misunderstand
the three of us.

511
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Make sure that the doors are locked

512
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,520
and that the yantras are intact.

513
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
Chakart is also in her room.

514
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Knock on her door if you need anything.

515
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,080
Let's just say she's your neighbor.

516
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
There's nothing to be afraid of.

517
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
- Shit!
- Fuck!

518
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Shit!

519
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,400
- Is it a ghost?
- Tong!

520
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
Chakart!

521
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,680
A ghost!

522
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,040
Gosh!

523
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
Come on in!

524
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
What's going on?

525
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,840
It's like you're running from a ghost.

526
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,200
Why am I just standing here?

527
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,520
Tell me what's on your mind.

528
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
And you...

529
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,760
Looks like you've got
something on your mind, too.

530
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,000
I...

531
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,840
I have none.

532
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,320
Neither do I.

533
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Right.

534
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I actually do.

535
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
About what?

536
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,920
Do you think that

537
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,000
something weird is going on
at the office?

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
How exactly?

539
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm still fine.

540
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
No.

541
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Like...

542
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,080
There are just so many strange things.

543
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,800
If you're talking about that...

544
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Nokphaeng didn't mean it.

545
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Mm.

546
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I...

547
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,280
That's what I've also heard.

548
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
But whatever.

549
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,320
I know what you're trying
to do to Master.

550
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Do what?

551
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,400
I was just being sweet to him.

552
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160
He's at the office to work, no?

553
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,080
I also know

554
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,720
what you're trying to do.

555
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I'm not.

556
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm simply

557
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,920
taking care of him as part of my job.

558
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
Righto.

559
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,880
I hope that is true.

560
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Right.

561
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,320
You're the one who should keep your word.

562
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,840
Hey, boys.

563
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
Make yourselves at home, okay?

564
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
Don't be scared.

565
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Understood?

566
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Thank you.

567
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Honestly...

568
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Why didn't we chant incantations
to fight back?

569
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Yeah.

570
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That would've gotten us
to sleep comfortably.

571
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
You're right.

572
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,520
I think

573
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,160
you're better than what you think.

574
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,760
As for karmic creditors,

575
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,960
you can smash them, right?

576
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,480
He's right.

577
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,040
Remember when you exorcised a ghost
at my brother's house?

578
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,200
That was just me being lucky.

579
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,000
Still, thank you

580
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
for making my night better,

581
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,040
even though you want to see ghosts.

582
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,200
If a ghost wants to claim your life,

583
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
why don't you do it to them first?

584
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,800
You're such a...

585
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,640
What a waste of your ghost experiences.

586
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,920
Enough, guys.

587
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
We have to prepare for tomorrow.

588
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,080
Prepare for livestreaming?

589
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,080
Prepare to be sweaty.

590
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,600
Gosh!

591
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,640
You have a really dirty mind, Namo!

592
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
A fortune-telling session

593
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,080
is like breaking a sweat.

594
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,040
Let's see who will make you all sweaty.

595
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,120
Stop it, Namo.

596
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Just get back to your funeral things.

597
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Come on!

598
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
You're...

599
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Make sure your client is satisfied.

600
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,480
Stop it already!

601
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
It's you again?

602
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Why the hell
do you want to come after me so badly?

603
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,680
This time...

604
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,080
I'm coming for you,

605
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,400
my karmic creditor.

606
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,920
Are you ready?

607
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,480
Are you ready?!

608
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,040
Ready for fucking what?!

609
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Phloeng?

610
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,680
What's going on?

611
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Good question.

612
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Are we in a dream?

613
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
And...

614
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
Whose dream is this?

615
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's mine.

616
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
That means...

617
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,680
Hello, I'm Win, a seer.

618
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,040
Today, I'm going to do
a personal card reading for you guys.

619
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,120
(Fear: Hello, Master Win)

620
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,840
(SUM: Hello)

621
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,720
(Gib: Hi!)

622
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,960
(Tony: Please do mine)

623
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,800
(nana: Yay, you're live!)

624
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
So many viewers.

625
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,320
(Gae: Yay! You're here!)
(OH: Yay! I'm so happy you're live)

626
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,480
(ZARA: Hello!!)
(BOB: Let me be your first one)

627
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,416
(NOI: I wish Phloeng
were there with you)

628
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
(MA: Win, my boy!)

629
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,960
Goodness gracious!

630
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,440
3,000 viewers?!

631
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,400
I've never had this many viewers.

632
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,680
Your personal card
is similar to your guardian angel.

633
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,080
There are over 70 different tarot cards.

634
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,600
Each has unique characteristics.

635
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Your card, therefore, is distinct
and reflects your unique character.

636
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,080
And I generally only reveal three cards.

637
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,040
(MA: Win, my boy!)

638
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,120
(MA: You're so cute)

639
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,600
(MA: You're the cutest fortune teller of all)

640
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
(MA: I want to squeeze
your cheeks so bad)

641
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,560
(NEW: I'm excited
to see you read the cards!)

642
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,360
Today, I'll be randomly picking viewers
for a card reading session.

643
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,840
(KAE: The way you said "cards"
is so adorable)

644
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,040
(Tachang: How does the lucky draw work?)

645
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
"How does the lucky draw work?"

646
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,920
That's a good question.

647
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,640
I haven't thought about it.

648
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,920
(Tachang: How about picking a number?)

649
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,800
(Tachang: Then we'll try to guess it)

650
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,920
(Tachang: The first one to
correctly guess the number wins)

651
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
That's a very good idea.

652
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,640
Thank you, Tachang.

653
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,920
The number I'm thinking of is

654
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,360
07.

655
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,880
Our first lucky winner is Tachang,

656
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,120
one of my first fans.

657
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,560
Tachang, please concentrate.

658
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,120
May your guardian angel
reveal your destiny.

659
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,720
Then, I'd like to do a reading
of your personal card.

660
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,720
Tachang,

661
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,840
you're such a hardworking individual.

662
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,680
You're good at your job.

663
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
You're born to work.

664
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,560
You're the backbone of your family.

665
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
You're a reliable person

666
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,480
and have excellent leadership.

667
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,600
When your friends
or partner is in trouble,

668
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
it's usually you

669
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,880
who helps and supports them.

670
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,040
This is your true self, Tachang.

671
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,240
Your personal card is...

672
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, by the way,

673
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
you seem to wander a lot.

674
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,400
(Tachang: Should I start
hitting on someone?)

675
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,600
Your reading suggests that you do it.

676
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,200
I think you
may already have met that person.

677
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,000
So go for it.

678
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
I'm rooting for you.

679
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Hello, Tong.

680
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
Yes, Tul?

681
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,520
Can you check Master Win's schedule?

682
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Why?

683
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,320
I'd like to discuss the show with him

684
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,800
and invite him to have dinner with me

685
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
as a celebration for hitting 1M views.

686
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Absolutely.

687
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,320
As for the thing between us,

688
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,880
please let it end.

689
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
Let's not bring it up.

690
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Sure thing.

691
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,960
I also don't want to talk about it.

692
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,280
Who should be the next person?

693
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,200
(Teng: Do one for Phloeng!)

694
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,240
(Taksin: Yes, please do one for Phloeng)

695
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,080
(Ing: Please read Phloeng's card)

696
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,760
(Nutin: @pntt Phloengggg)

697
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,800
He's probably working on a show.

698
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,880
That's enough.

699
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,400
Please don't tag Phloeng.

700
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,200
You're going to disturb him.

701
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,480
(Ing: OMG!! Phloeng!)

702
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,176
(Prae: Phloeng's watching Win's live?
Didn't expect that!)

703
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,840
(tanatorn: He's really here!)

704
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
(Tu: Phloeng is here?! I can't!)

705
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,440
(Pom: I've never seen
him watch anyone's live)

706
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
(Chor: Phloeng's
watching the live?! Ahh!!)

707
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
(Pop: I feel blessed)

708
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,680
Hello, Phloeng.

709
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Well...

710
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,560
Am I troubling you?

711
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Well...

712
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
If I am, it's okay.

713
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,640
(pntt: Kinda)

714
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,920
(pntt: But since you're like this,
I think I can stay for a while)

715
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,520
(Nadech: UGHHDHSGSG!)

716
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,000
(sutep: w-wwhat?)

717
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,320
(Pitha: Ships are sailing,
I don't mind going to hell.)

718
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,816
(Nuthin: Don't do thisss.
(I'm a shipper, i can't stop my mind)

719
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,680
(Hunsen: I canttt!
(My heart's skipping the beat))

720
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,200
(Tukky: #PloengWin?)

721
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,480
(Teng: my ghost ship's on)

722
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,840
If that's the case,

723
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,800
meditate and open your mind.

724
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,480
May your guardian angel
reveal your destiny.

725
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll do a reading on your personal card.

726
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,520
(pntt: I'm getting ready)

727
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,776
(nam: Pls don't say so politely TT)

728
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,136
(Pro: My heart's meltin...
(How come you guys say Phloeng's hot?)

729
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,456
(Pro: Phloeng on the master's live
is 100x hotter!)

730
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,896
(Pita: Why are you so polite? I just can'ttt)

731
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,376
(Ing: Can u facetime him? Wanna see both!)

732
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,800
(Pita: Facetime himmmm)

733
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
(nammm: plsss ft him)

734
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,080
(Tukky: Facetime! Facetime!)

735
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,960
(Nuthin: Video calling him noww)

736
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Well...

737
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,840
I do not accept either
audio or video calls during livestreams.

738
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,400
No more shipping us.
(Ing: Ooh master's explanation is spot on!)

739
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,056
Phloengnathitorn and I are
(Tuu: Live's ending? I'm too late)

740
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,400
just working together
on 'Spooky Hellish Night.'

741
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,720
So please...

742
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

743
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,600
What?!

744
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,000
How did that happen?

745
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
I accidentally tapped it.

746
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Yes?

747
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,480
Well...

748
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,840
I guess we're doing a video call.

749
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
Your cards are...

750
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,440
excellent.

751
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,680
The Emperor represents power.

752
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,640
The Sun represents prosperity.

753
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,560
With the two combined,

754
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
it means that you have a lot of patrons.

755
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
Death, however,

756
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,560
has two meanings.

757
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,800
It represents two things.

758
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,480
The first one is...

759
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,640
You're having terrible luck.

760
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,120
When paired with The Emperor

761
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,840
and The Sun,

762
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
it means that
your good fortune is resilient,

763
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,760
even more so
than Captain America's shield.

764
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Is that it?

765
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
That's it.

766
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,000
Here's a question.

767
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Yes?

768
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
What's the point?

769
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,960
Well...

770
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,640
Knowing what your personal card is...

771
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
It's like...

772
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,960
It's basically your significator card.

773
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,640
For your subsequent readings,

774
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,440
let's say The Sun
is your significator card...

775
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,280
Look at it
alongside the two accompanying cards,

776
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
and you'll be able to know

777
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,560
who, when, or what

778
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,040
will be coming your way.

779
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,600
To put it simply, here's an example.

780
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,760
Here's The Knight of Pentacles.

781
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,600
It represents investment and cycles.

782
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,480
The Sun represents you.

783
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,320
The Eight of Pentacles
represents your unique skills.

784
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,440
When the three are combined,
it means that

785
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,640
you have plans to start a business

786
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
that requires such skills.

787
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,960
The reading suggests you go for it.

788
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,280
That's it for me, guys.

789
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,760
We've done quite a lot, haven't we?

790
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,200
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

791
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,520
I have to end the livestream now.

792
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,720
Have a good one, guys.

793
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,960
Take care of yourselves

794
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,640
and don't stay up for too long.

795
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,520
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

796
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,120
You look so natural,

797
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,320
and that's lovely.

798
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,320
I'm no longer interested in you.

799
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm going to claim Win as mine.

800
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,800
You're actually not that hot, you know?

801
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
She visited a fortune teller

802
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,096
and was told
to get an offering for the shrine.

803
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,040
These are for ghosts, I'm sure.

804
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,040
Don't think that
being with a highly virtuous soul

805
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,640
would protect you from me.

806
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,040
The ones around you

807
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,120
will be dead.

808
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,960
Hey!

809
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Chakart!

810
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,296
Luck hasn't been on your side, has it?

811
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,616
If you're afraid of ghosts tonight,

812
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
stay in my room, okay?
