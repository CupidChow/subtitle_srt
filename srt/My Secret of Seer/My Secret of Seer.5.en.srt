(Directed by: Siwasit Phondongnok)

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,800
What did you mean?

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,520
Why did you say luck wasn't on my side?

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,520
My friend is a fortune teller, and he never tells me that.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,160
If you don't believe me, check this out.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,800
See?

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,360
I just won the two-digit prize in the lottery.

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Are you seeing this?

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Stop with the nonsense.

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,280
Fine.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,960
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
Why should I tell you?

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,280
What?

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,160
We'll meet again

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
- Why? - because...

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,360
Are you going to alter my destiny?

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Or are you here to get rid of me?

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
What's up with him?

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,360
You think you can just come and go?

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,040
I won the lottery.

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,600
How would I have bad luck?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,960
Phloeng?

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,960
What's wrong?

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Do you think staying close to me will keep you safe?

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,600
I'll get rid of everyone myself.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,520
What are you going to do to me?

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,240
Huh?

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
What did I do, Master?

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
I think...

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
We should enter the building.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Whoa.

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Coming to the building together like this...

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
Is there something going on?

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
It's not like what it seems, Ple.

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,640
Oh?

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,920
I didn't say anything.

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,520
Eh?

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,160
You're looking suspicious.

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
What is it between you two?

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,200
What the hell are you saying?

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't get flustered, you two.

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Are you good?

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Yeah, I am.

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,400
It's just that there's something on my mind.

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
What is it?

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,200
A one-night stand?

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
No, not that.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
I stayed over 'cause I was scared of ghosts.

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,760
You had a one-night stand?

60
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
With who?

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
Is he hot?

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,000
Tong, keep it down.

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,240
No wonder you didn't text me at all.

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
I...

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,320
Just say you had a one-night stand with Phloeng.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
We're friends here.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Namo,

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,520
you bastard.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,640
Uh...

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
Is he good with the moves?

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,120
Gosh!

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,200
I said we didn't have a one-night stand.

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Come on.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,120
MP Eung will be disappointed in you.

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,960
You're useless.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
He is so demanding, isn't he?

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,560
Uh...

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,440
Master and the team, you may enter the meeting now.

79
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
- Okay, sure. - Okay.

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
- Right this way. - Okay.

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,040
A one-night stand, was it?

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Everybody is here, right?

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,360
Whoa, Master...

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,360
You look so fresh and happy today.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,320
Master got the good stuff last night.

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,600
Namo!

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
The reason for today's meeting

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,440
is to discuss a special project

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,240
that many of you

90
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
may already be familiar with.

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,280
This meeting is intended to keep you up to date, Master.

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,440
What's the project?

93
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Next week, we're shooting a show outside the city.

94
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,920
The show's called 'Spooky Hellish Night on the Rocks.'

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
It's an outdoor show about ghost stories

96
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
that airs quarterly as part of 'Spooky Hellish Night.'

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,200
This time, we're shooting outside the city.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
However, we don't know what province we'll be going to.

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
And do I have to join you guys?

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,040
I thought we only recorded the show here.

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,520
I really wish you could join us, Master.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Your rating is going through the roof right now.

103
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
Any videos about you

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,080
always pull millions of views.

105
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
More importantly, our fans absolutely love it

106
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,280
when you're close to Phloeng.

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,240
Don't worry about the expenses.

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,720
We'll support you financially.

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,520
As a cherry on top, you'll get paid extra.

110
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,480
It's worth the effort, Master.

111
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,040
Don't you agree, Tul?

112
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
That's correct.

113
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Please tell us how much you're requesting.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
But...

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Maybe he's scared.

116
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm not.

117
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,720
If you aren't, then don't hesitate.

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm not hesitating.

119
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
It's obvious that you are.

120
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Well, I said I'm not.

121
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,800
That means you're joining us, correct?

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,080
I am.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,960
Okay.

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,440
Please resume the meeting.

125
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
He's finally given in.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,600
It's settled, then.

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,080
Can I use the toilet for a minute?

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
Namo.

129
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
Come and take my spot.

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
- Where are you going? - The toilet.

131
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
You may continue.

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,960
Alright.

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
It's probably nothing.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you okay, Master?

135
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
If you don't want to go, tell me.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,960
Right.

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm good.

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,240
Right...

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

140
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
I've got nothing against this.

141
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm up for the project.

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
That's great to hear.

143
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,040
If you feel a bit tired,

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,720
feel free to join the meeting later.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,600
Right.

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,080
Tul...

147
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes?

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
Your end is near, old hag.

149
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
I'll put you out of your misery.

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,680
What's going on, Master?

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,760
I think something bad has happened.

152
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
I think it's this way.

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,520
Right.

154
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,680
Currently, we're searching for a province

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
and a location with stories to film.

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
If you have a place in mind or would like to suggest one,

157
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,000
feel free to reach out to me.

158
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Huh?

159
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Were you draining the ocean or what?

160
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Where's Win?

161
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,680
I don't know.

162
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
I saw him go out with Tul.

163
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,920
Win's still not back?

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
I'll go and look for him.

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,600
Tong said that

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,520
he's with Tul.

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
- Right? - Mm.

168
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Then I guess I'm staying here.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
I think...

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
It's this room.

171
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,760
Let's go.

172
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,760
- Auntie! - Auntie!!

173
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
Auntie...

174
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
- Auntie... - Auntie!

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Master, wait here.

176
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll call an ambulance.

177
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,880
Auntie!

178
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Auntie...

179
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,880
Master?!

180
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Master!

181
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,920
I never thought the security guard would do such a thing.

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,760
It was me.

183
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,200
- A few days ago, - Correct.

184
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
- he looked weird. - It's Tulatorn.

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Perhaps it's because of my bad luck year.

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,680
Maybe her time was due.

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
I have to go now.

188
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
Wait.

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
Where are you going?

190
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
To prepare for a funeral.

191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,600
Yesterday, it was Chakart.

192
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Today, it's the housekeeper.

193
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,400
There's no place to cremate bodies at this rate.

194
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,880
Are you coming home with me?

195
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm good.

196
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,920
Thanks.

197
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
I just don't want anything bad to happen to you.

198
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Are you okay?

199
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,960
I don't want any of you to be in trouble.

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,560
It's okay.

201
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
I'll be fine.

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,160
I'll catch you guys later.

203
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
- Be seeing you. - See you.

204
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,520
Win Wongsawat.

205
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes.

206
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Yeah.

207
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
My name is Tulatorn.

208
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
And my name is Phloengnathitorn.

209
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
Please tell Tul that I'm sorry.

210
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,920
Will do.

211
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
See you.

212
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Sure.

213
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm more than happy to.

214
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,560
Tong.

215
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
Where's Win?

216
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,840
He's gone home.

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,320
Tul.

218
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
Just let him go home alone.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
He's been through a lot.

220
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,600
Okay.

221
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,160
Why are you following me?

222
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,040
You're imagining it.

223
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm on my way to get some stuff.

224
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,440
Right.

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,240
By the way, where are you going, Master?

226
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,160
Want me to give you a ride?

227
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm good.

228
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I think...

229
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,360
I want to be alone for a while.

230
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,680
Oh, Venerable Father!

231
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,600
Haven't you recalled

232
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,240
I told you not to travel out of the city?

233
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,760
It's only been two months since my birthday.

234
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,680
Are they really going to take my life?

235
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,040
You've dreamed about ghosts.

236
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,200
Do you think their intention is true or not?

237
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,000
They might not be ghosts.

238
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,760
Dreams are just a result of brain activity.

239
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
You've seen ghosts for your entire life,

240
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,000
yet you're using science as your excuse?

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
I simply want to say that...

242
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,960
This trip of yours... You will not make it back.

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,560
Please don't say that, Venerable Father.

244
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
I don't want to die just yet.

245
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,640
If I decline this time, I'll surely face disapproval.

246
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,920
I won't be able to make a living online for decades.

247
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,760
That's up to you.

248
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Perhaps, it's your own karma.

249
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,400
Aw...

250
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
Who would dare accept the offer if you say that?

251
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
Do you dare to decline such an offer?

252
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
Yes.

253
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
But, yeah...

254
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
You do know that

255
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,280
I hate going back on my promises.

256
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,120
Ouch! Venerable Father...

257
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,360
Alright.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,520
Whatever will be, will be.

259
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,440
We can't resist fate, can we?

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,040
By the way,

261
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,200
have you met the highly virtuous soul?

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,520
The highly virtuous soul

263
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,080
that you talked about?

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,440
I think I may have already met him.

265
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
It's Phloengnathitorn,

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,280
a man who possesses the Radiance of the Seven Gems.

267
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, that's him.

268
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,240
Keep him close, understand?

269
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,240
What's wrong, Win?

270
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,960
Let me rest a bit, Toh.

271
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,240
Hello, Waew?

272
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,240
How are things? Have you seen Chakart's ghost?

273
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
Watch your tongue, Waew.

274
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,560
She must've been on her way to Uncle.

275
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,800
He's the love of her life, you know?

276
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,480
Mm.

277
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,560
Also...

278
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,120
Namo is helping with her funeral.

279
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
Have you been doing well?

280
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,760
While living in the mountains, I've discovered a certain truth.

281
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,080
A local, an owner of a homestay, died right before my eyes.

282
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,160
So don't die, okay?

283
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,920
Take good care of yourself.

284
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,080
Wait until we meet again.

285
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,760
Right. I know.

286
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,600
I won't die that easily.

287
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,320
By the way, can you go and find my book?

288
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
I've written something in it.

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,200
I was told to give it to you after your birthday,

290
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
but I forgot.

291
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Which one is it, Waew?

292
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,520
There are so many of them.

293
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
The normal-looking one.

294
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
It's a book that compiles all sorts of incantations.

295
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Maybe it's the purple one.

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,280
On the second shelf.

297
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,640
Runes?

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
Incantations?

299
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,800
You perform this kind of stuff, too?

300
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
Yeah, I studied them.

301
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Give it a read.

302
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,760
A book of sorcery?

303
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
This is scary.

304
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,800
Scary how?

305
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Just go through the pages first.

306
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
It took a lot for me to get to study it.

307
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,600
Right. I have to go now.

308
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,040
What's this, Win?

309
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,960
Why does it look so sketchy?

310
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,360
Agreed, Toh.

311
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,160
Hold this.

312
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,480
(Phloeng: Do you want to make merit tomorrow?)

313
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,600
At any rate,

314
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,800
keep him close, understand?

315
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,360
He'll be able to protect you.

316
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,760
(Is it the work of destiny or fate?)

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,760
(I have no choice but to accept it)

318
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,520
(I've tried so hard, but it's impossible to run away)

319
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,760
(I have to accept that things are here to stay)

320
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,760
(I've always thought that love was just a ruse)

321
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,600
(I've never thought that my true love would be you)

322
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,000
(Love that everyone says it's marvelous)

323
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,960
First time?

324
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,080
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

325
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,920
Thank you for being here with me.

326
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,040
Right.

327
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,440
Doesn't it feel hot being in a temple?

328
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,480
Are you saying that I'm a ghost?

329
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,120
Glad you know.

330
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,920
What?!

331
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,040
May the merit from this act

332
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
go to Yok.

333
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,760
Hey!

334
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,320
That's the guard.

335
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,320
Mister?

336
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,520
Hey!

337
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,560
Don't come any closer.

338
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,760
Hey! Let me go!

339
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,320
You can't run away now.

340
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,560
I've called the police.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,360
Hey! Let go!

342
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

343
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,600
Mister Guard...

344
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
What happened?

345
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I don't know.

346
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,080
It felt like...

347
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
I fell asleep.

348
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,840
Fell asleep?

349
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,240
What about prior to this?

350
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
Have you seen anything unusual?

351
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
Prior to this?

352
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,080
I didn't see anything.

353
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
But recently, I've noticed a lot of people coming to the office.

354
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
They'd come and wait for something.

355
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,280
They looked dirty.

356
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,960
Some of them even tried to climb the walls.

357
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,520
Phloeng's aura was immense,

358
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,440
yet why were they still trying?

359
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,320
Ah...

360
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm...

361
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm scared.

362
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,200
I... I...

363
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,080
I didn't kill Cleaner Nuan, did I?

364
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey...

365
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,880
And...

366
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,560
Before this,

367
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,120
have you seen something else unusual near the office?

368
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
May I have great wealth. Sadhu.

369
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,360
Tong, Tong...

370
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,320
Need something?

371
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,360
Uh...

372
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm here to deliver this document.

373
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,480
Oh.

374
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,800
Thank you.

375
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
So...

376
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,720
Is Win's project ongoing?

377
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,720
Oh, yes, it is.

378
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,480
Perfect.

379
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,560
I'm sure that this EP will also get a million views.

380
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,800
I sure hope so.

381
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,800
By the way...

382
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,760
Are you okay?

383
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I am.

384
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,000
I've been getting into fights with my partner.

385
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,040
I see.

386
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,840
Best of luck to you.

387
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,520
I've got this for you.

388
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,600
This sure can help.

389
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,760
Your love life will be better.

390
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,760
You can return it to me if it doesn't work.

391
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,760
Thank you, Tong.

392
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Good luck.

393
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,680
Tong.

394
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,400
For now...

395
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
I'll talk to you later.

396
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,000
Have a good day.

397
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,920
Is Master okay?

398
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,600
He's gotten better now.

399
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,760
That's good.

400
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
Do you need something?

401
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,200
It's nothing.

402
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,640
It's...

403
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,760
What's the next step about Win?

404
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,240
Should I confess my love to him?

405
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
I think...

406
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
Now isn't the best time.

407
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,280
Maybe wait until we are out of town.

408
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,960
Mm...

409
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,120
You're right.

410
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,000
Now might be too early.

411
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,200
Way too early.

412
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,320
Then...

413
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,760
What is it?

414
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,240
Please give this to Master.

415
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,680
Understood.

416
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,280
What? Tomorrow?

417
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
I forgot.

418
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,040
Do I need to bring anything?

419
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
No need.

420
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,120
I've already taken care of everything myself.

421
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,160
Right.

422
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Hey!

423
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,200
Toh!

424
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you going to do this again?

425
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,800
Not anymore.

426
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,560
You...

427
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,520
What the hell are you doing?

428
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Well...

429
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm trying to learn something new.

430
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,200
It's for dealing with my karmic creditor.

431
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
Isn't this dark magic?

432
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,520
Runes.

433
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
Incantations.

434
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Witches.

435
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Witchcraft.

436
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,280
We'll see

437
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,520
if my karmic creditor

438
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
finds all of these ineffective.

439
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,360
What do you want me to do?

440
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,120
In the next 15 minutes,

441
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,360
if I drift away,

442
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,600
kick and send me flying, okay?

443
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,480
You'll...be safe, right?

444
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Mm.

445
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,520
Okay.

446
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,800
Brother...

447
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,400
Please help Win.

448
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Is it working?

449
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,320
Let's try again.

450
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
Nothing happened.

451
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,280
What's wrong with Dad?

452
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,760
I don't know.

453
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
This is bad.

454
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,200
Ow!

455
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,360
Shit, my leg...

456
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,320
Win...

457
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,200
Win!

458
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,400
Ow...

459
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,760
Win.

460
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,440
Win!

461
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Win!

462
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,160
Ah.

463
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,240
Ow.

464
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,680
Shit.

465
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,080
Are you alright?

466
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm hurt.

467
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,560
That was horrifying.

468
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
What happened?

469
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,120
I think...

470
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,720
I've found my karmic creditor.

471
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:12,960
(With condolences, MP Eung and family)

472
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,200
If I were to die,

473
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,240
how long before my fans forget about me?

474
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,920
Come on, Wongsawat.

475
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,840
Has the dinner here made you lose your mind?

476
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,920
Come on.

477
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,360
Nobody's going to forget about you.

478
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
Nowadays,

479
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,040
digital footprint is very apparent.

480
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,760
Your funny and goofy videos are all over the Internet.

481
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,360
By the time they forget about you,

482
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
all the plastic in the world will have broken down.

483
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,680
Mm.

484
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,880
Thank you, Namo.

485
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,000
Mm.

486
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,760
That really helped me.

487
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,320
Hey.

488
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,520
Well...

489
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,320
I've got something to tell you.

490
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,840
- It's... - There.

491
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,840
One of your husbands is here.

492
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,720
Maybe he's attending the housekeeper's funeral.

493
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,360
Cut it out, Namo.

494
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Are you tired, Master?

495
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm supposed to ask you the question.

496
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,960
Thank you,

497
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,680
for trying to save her.

498
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
Please don't thank me.

499
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,040
I couldn't save her in time.

500
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Had we been quicker...

501
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,320
It's okay, Master.

502
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,680
I think...

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,840
She's at peace now.

504
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,360
On top of that, the guard has been arrested.

505
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I think everything's starting to get better.

506
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,800
I guess.

507
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
I think death doesn't just mean

508
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,840
the body naturally breaking down,

509
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,960
but also ceasing to be remembered by the living.

510
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
It's at that point

511
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,280
when the person is truly dead.

512
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,440
I think...

513
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,200
You should bring this up on the show.

514
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,600
Huh?

515
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,200
A lot of people will subscribe to your idea.

516
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,240
Who exactly do you want me to tell this to?

517
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,920
It's knowledge for the common good.

518
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,160
Right.

519
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,760
It's time for me to go.

520
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,520
- I'll be seeing you. - Right.

521
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
Hey, young boy.

522
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,640
Can you check the toilet?

523
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,760
The door can't be locked.

524
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,760
Please. It's this way.

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,400
It's this one.

526
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,440
It's this stall, you see.

527
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,520
Please have a look.

528
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,600
I don't know why, but it can't be locked.

529
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,280
Sure thing, Uncle.

530
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,560
Thanks, young boy.

531
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,560
It works just fine, Uncle.

532
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,320
Mm...

533
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,520
Can you try it again?

534
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,680
Please, help me.

535
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,440
No problem.

536
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,040
It works, Uncle.

537
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,800
Uncle?

538
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,520
Uncle...

539
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,920
Uncle.

540
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
Shit!

541
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
I can't unlock the door.

542
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,160
Uncle.

543
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,160
Uncle!

544
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Please unlock the door for me.

545
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,520
Hey, Uncle!

546
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,640
Is anybody there?

547
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,800
Help, I'm stuck in the toilet stall.

548
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,000
You're in trouble now, Uncle.

549
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,120
Come on, pick up the phone, Namo.

550
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,160
Anybody there?

551
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,240
Help me.

552
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,520
I'm stuck in the toilet stall.

553
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,720
Shit, this is bad.

554
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,200
The Uncle must've been one of the servants.

555
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
The real one is coming.

556
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Phloeng?

557
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,960
Is this what you want, my karmic creditor?!

558
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,520
Why isn't he picking up?

559
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,720
Win, are you okay?

560
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
Hey, Win!

561
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,280
Win!

562
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,520
What's wrong?

563
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,920
Win!

564
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,160
Wake up, Win!

565
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
Wayu.

566
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,960
Win.

567
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,000
Hello, Wayu.

568
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,280
Okay, understood.

569
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,160
Win!

570
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Can you hear me?

571
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,560
Venerable Father...

572
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,800
Wait here.

573
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,720
I'll be back.

574
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Venerable Father!

575
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,960
Please...

576
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,680
Please let me be yours.

577
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,160
Phloeng?

578
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,320
Hey...

579
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,760
Hatred...

580
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,840
ceases by smashing it to bits!

581
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,040
You have nothing left.

582
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,280
Ah!

583
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,120
Let go!

584
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,520
Go away!

585
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,040
Ah!

586
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,520
Ow...

587
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
Let go of me!

588
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,200
Ah!

589
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,200
Allow me to lend you my aid.

590
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,840
If you encounter a ghost in disguise,

591
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
kick it in the groin.

592
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Ow!

593
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,840
I'm not scared of you, you foul ghost!

594
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,040
Hey...

595
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,760
Ow.

596
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,280
Wait!

597
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, shit.

598
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,280
Phloeng?

599
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,840
Master?

600
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,520
What was that for?

601
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,960
Are you the real one?

602
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,920
Of course, I am.

603
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,880
Why did you slap me?

604
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm sorry. I...

605
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,800
I thought you weren't the real one.

606
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
You're making me really paranoid.

607
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,120
Wayu?

608
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,800
Wayu? Who?

609
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,280
Whoa.

610
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,720
You can also see him?

611
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,960
See who?

612
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
That guy.

613
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,640
Of course, I can.

614
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,560
How come?

615
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,000
That's my younger brother.

616
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,080
Huh?

617
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,080
He's my fraternal twin brother.

618
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,840
You have a twin?

619
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,680
I didn't know you did.

620
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,040
Right.

621
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,840
My name is Wayu.

622
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,920
Master...

623
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
You don't know?

624
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,000
Wayu,

625
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,720
I'm so sorry

626
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,080
that I...

627
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,040
I did that to you.

628
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,920
No worries.

629
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,400
But you got me good there.

630
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,440
Right. I'll drive you home.

631
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,160
(Siam Nithrarom Co., Ltd)

632
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,840
Win, my friend, I'm back!

633
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,320
Win!

634
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,040
You?

635
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,680
And...

636
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,160
Where did Win go?

637
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,760
Too late.

638
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,240
There.

639
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,760
He's leaving with Phloeng.

640
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,440
Gosh.

641
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,200
I got him so much stuff.

642
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,520
He's no longer possessed?

643
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,560
Why didn't he tell me?

644
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,080
This took a while, you know?

645
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,080
Uncle,

646
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
I'm returning these to you.

647
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,160
I've got no use for them now.

648
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,080
Are you sure?

649
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,480
Yes.

650
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,640
- Okay. - My friend is alright now.

651
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,920
- Okay, okay. - Thank you.

652
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,360
- No problem. Alright. - Right.

653
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,040
Hey, you.

654
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,240
You're still here?

655
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,720
I'm leaving soon.

656
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,680
Thank you so much

657
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,760
for saving my friend today.

658
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,680
Mm.

659
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,760
And...

660
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,560
You're still here?

661
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,520
I'm sticking around.

662
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,720
I don't want to see a boy going home by himself.

663
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,920
There are ghosts here.

664
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,920
Come on, to my car.

665
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,760
Don't make excuses.

666
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,520
Why should I?

667
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,360
Huh?

668
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,360
Are you trying to get me?

669
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,600
I've called a ride already.

670
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,440
It's arriving soon.

671
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,000
There's something I need to talk to you.

672
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,240
What is it?

673
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,200
Can't we discuss it here?

674
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,560
It's about your friend.

675
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,440
If you want to find out,

676
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,760
follow me.

677
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,080
Just admit you have a crush on me.

678
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,520
Do I still have a chance?

679
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,080
I have no clue at this point.

680
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,360
Tul sent this over to you.

681
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,400
This is absolutely horrifying.

682
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,680
Tong is using dark magic.

683
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,640
What about Job?

684
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,440
He entered an abandoned house.

685
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,120
This is the message he sent:

686
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,040
"Help me."

687
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,440
A murder occurred in this house.

688
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,160
Depression,

689
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,920
anger,

690
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,280
sorrow, and anguish...

691
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,520
(Is it the work of destiny or fate?)

692
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,560
(I have no choice but to accept it)

693
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:01,320
(I've tried so hard, but it's impossible to run away)

694
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,080
(I have to accept that things are here to stay)

695
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,120
(I've always thought that love was just a ruse)

696
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,400
(I've never thought that my true love would be you)
