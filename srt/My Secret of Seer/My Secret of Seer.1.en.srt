00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,360
In this world,
there are hundreds of kinds of scent.

2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,480
My name is Win Wongsawat,

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,280
and I can "smell" spiritual energy.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,480
Well, actually,
I can smell all the scents in this world.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,720
I was born with
a hypersensitive sense of smell,

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
whether they are physical scents

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,520
like food,

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
desserts,

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,760

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
perfumes,

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
and flowers,

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,520
or intangible ones

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
like virtue,

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
evil,

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
love,

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,360
greed,

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,360
wrath,

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
and obsession,

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,840
each with its own distinct scent.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,080
And lastly, there's spiritual energy.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Hello?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey, Win!

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,720
Wait there at the restaurant.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Something happened to
your fortune-telling client.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm picking them up right now.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Sure. Hurry, then.

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,720
I'm sleepy and it's cold.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,080
The A/C here is freezing me to death.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
Okay, okay.

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,400
- One iced Americano, please.
- Yes, just a moment.

31
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,000
Whose jacket is this?

32
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,160
The scent of summer?

33

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Sometimes I can't tell
if this is reality, a dream…

36
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,400
or some other world.

37
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Who's there?!

38
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Please...

39
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Are you ready?

40
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Are you ready?!

41
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,400
This dream again.

43
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
Venerable Father,

44
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
this batch looks smaller than usual.

45
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Win.

46
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,160
Your bad luck year can be fatal.

47
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
From now on,

48
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,240
you'll encounter many inexplicable events.

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Here.

50
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,720
Thank you, Venerable Father.

51
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
But...

52
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,160
I already know these kinds of things.

53
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,600
It won't suffice.

54
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:30,086
But why do they want to take my life?

55
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
That I do not know.

56
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,600
But a highly virtuous individual is your refuge.

A highly virtuous individual?

Who is it?

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,760
You have a better sense of smell than I do.

60
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
Use it.

61
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,520
Use it to your advantage.

62
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,520
That person will save you from demise.

63
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
They should not be far from your reach.

64
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
But the most important thing is,

65
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,600
you must not travel out of the city at all.

Win! What the hell have you been doing?

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,920
Your client, the heir of a gold shop,
is waiting for you!

The session starts at 9:30 A.M., no?

75
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Look at the time.

It's already 9:45!

77
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,600
Shit!

78
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,600
- Go. Now!
- I'm screwed!

79
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,400
So how is it, Master?

80
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
Why is it taking you so long?

81
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,080
Well, it's...

82
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,280
Well what? Just say it!

83
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm cool with whatever result.

84
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Well...

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Is it possible for you
to withdraw your shares right away?

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
This isn't your time.

87
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Huh?

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
What do you mean?

89
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Is it gonna be a loss?

90
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,800
Or a profit?

91
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,640
That's all I want to know.
Will I make a loss or a profit?

92
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,120
I don't have many options, do I?

93
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
That's all I want to find out.

94
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Come on.

95
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
Stop wasting time.

96
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Do you even know how to read fortunes?

97
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,960
I've got other things to do, you know?

98
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Please give me a moment.

99
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,760
This scent...
He's certainly running on borrowed money.

100
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
I think...

101
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
Think what?

102
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,760
It'll be catastrophic.

103
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You're definitely doomed.

104
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Hey!

105
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
How is that possible?

106
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
I've poured so much into it!

107
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,080
I shouldn't have asked you for a reading.

108
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,176
- This is unacceptable!
- Please wait a moment, Mr. King.

109
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,480
Would you like to read
other aspects instead?

110
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Anything else you're still worried about?

111
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
I only came for one thing.

112
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
That's it. I've had enough.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,080
- Mr. King!
- Disappointing!

114
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,136
- I'm not paying.
- Please wait!

115
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,520
- Mr. King!
- Hey, Namo.

116
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,640
Let him go.

117
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,080
Come on, man.

118
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,760
A client's satisfaction can go both ways.

119
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,760
You're a bastard yourself.

120
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,400
Only bringing me shady clients.

121
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,080
What? How am I supposed to know?

122
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,600
I don't have smelling senses like you!

123
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,600
What do we do next?

124
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,960
We don't have that many clients this month.

125
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
There are barely any, even.

126
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,160
I've already dealt with old clients.

127
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,280
I paid for ads and promoted the page,
but it got reported...

128
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,480
What should we do?

129
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,480
That's right. I'm Win Wongsawat.

130
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,200
I can smell spiritual energy.

131
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
Most of the time, it's just the scents.

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
But if it's strong, I can hear them too.

133
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,920
When my mind is weak,
they show themselves in 8K Ultra HD.

134
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,160
I can smell everything in this world.

135
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,760
By everything, I really mean it.

136
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
Including spiritual energy,

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,320
which is unique to each spirit.

138
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
However, all of these require interpretation.

139
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,880
I myself haven't explored every scent, either.

140
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Shit!

141
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,080
This always happened
at every workplace I was in.

142
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,840
And I'd get scolded by my boss,

143
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
have my salary cut,

144
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,776
and become a gossip topic among colleagues.

145
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm staying at Namo's father's condo,

147
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,520
as I couldn't afford a roof over my head.

148
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
Luckily, he's generous enough to let me stay

149
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,800
until I can afford my own place.

150
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,760
I spent days and nights looking for work,

151
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,720
until I realized that
I could make a living with fortune-telling.

152
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,000
However, with this card...

153
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,440
Guardian spirits and your karmic creditors
are coming for you

154
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
to remind you to pray and make merit.

155
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,440
They're waiting for your offerings.

156
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,080
So this card means
you have to make merits ASAP!

157
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
This is a warning.

158
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
However, if you don't have the time to do so,
feel free to reach out to me.

159
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,160
I have sacred blessings to help.

160
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Whoa...

161
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
It's clear.

162
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,480
Your partner is cheating on you.

163
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Are you serious?

164
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,680
Just as I thought...

165
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
What should I do, Namo?

166
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't know either.

167
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,000
I also got dumped.

168
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,480
This was when I realized
strange scents clouded them.

169
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,560
I've been doing fortune-telling
since I was a sophomore.

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,840
That was when I learned about tarot cards.

171
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,920
I taught myself everything.

172
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
Win,

173
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,720
your reading is spot on.

174
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,480
But honestly, I already knew that somewhat.

175
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,080
I'll put an end to this.

176
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
Excellent. You're doing the right thing.

177
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,240
This is heartbreaking.

178
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,120
Back then, I studied fortune-telling
only to help out my friends.

179
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,080
However, nobody knew that
I'd be making a living with this art.

180
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Right.

181
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Tong, the lighting's set.

182
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,000
How is it?
His face doesn't look sickly, does it?

183
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Look at the camera, Win.

184
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,080
Yeah. Good to go.

185
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
- Alright.
- All set?

186
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,840
Are you ready?

187
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Let's do this, Win!

188
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,400
We're going live.

189
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Three, two, one.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,040
Hello, everybody.

191
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm Master Win.

192
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,080
Feel free to send me your questions.

193
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,720
Hold on, Namo.

194
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,040
Is this your solution to my problem?

195
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Fortune telling at a funeral?

196
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Listen.

197
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
At least the food's free.

198
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,760
(With Condolences: MP Eung Wiriya and Family)

199
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Win?

200
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,680
Do you think this place is filled with ghosts?

201
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,120
Just because you don't see them
doesn't mean they don't know

202
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,560
you're disrespecting them!

203
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
What? Come on!

204
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm leaving.

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,440
Are you the fortune teller friend
of MP Eung's son?

206
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Yes.

207
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,440
Can you please give me a reading?

208
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Sure.

209
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,200
I'd like to know
if he's passed peacefully or not,

210
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,840
if he still has worries to cling to.

211
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,080
My son, Daeng...

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,520
He said that if he had to die,

213
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,320
he wanted to die in the line of duty.

214
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,360
And look at what his words got him!

215
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,240
But I've never done a reading for the dead...

216
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,480
It can get confusing.

217
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,560
Is this true?
He actually passed away happily?

218
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
Thank you so much, Master.

219
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
So, how much do you charge for this?

220
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,600
You've already paid me.

221
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Huh? When?

222
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
With the tasty food offered here.

223
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,920
Goodness me!
How are you this adorable?

224
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,000
If I won the lottery,
I'd never forget about you.

225
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
So touching...

226
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,416
This better be the last time.

227
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
No more fortune-telling like this,

228
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
especially at funerals!

229
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Here.

230
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Thank you.

231
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
Why do I smell... summer?

232
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
Where is it coming from?

233
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Oops!

234
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
My apologies.

235
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,280
Can I have some paper napkins, please?

236
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,040
Let me clean it up for you.

237
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
I can't sense what he's thinking.

238
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,600
All I sense is the scent of summer.

239
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,520
And the scent is very familiar.

240
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
Who are you looking for?

241
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,160
Don't be upset, Win.

242
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,000
You still have many more clients waiting.

243
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
It's not about that.

244
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
What are you upset about, then?

245
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,320
I've been having nightmares.

246
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,480
And nothing but bad luck.

247
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,760
Don't think that way.

248
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
You have to manifest and affirm
that good things are coming.

249
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm exhausted.

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,200
Come on.

251
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,480
Come on, Win.

252
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,760
My dad said you're a lovely person.

253
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
You help others through fortune telling.

254
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,440
The good karma will bring you luck. Trust me.

255
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,000
That's nonsense.

256
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,440
I've been doing this for two years now,
and I've had nothing but bad luck.

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
What are you looking at?

258
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You look so stressed.

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Give me a sec, Wongsawat. It's serious.

260
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
What's with him?

261
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Win.

262
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,080
We need to talk.

263
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,880
About what, exactly?

264
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
Do you know the 'Spooky Hellish Night' show?

265
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,240
The dance show you're hooked on?

266
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,560
No, it's not that!

267
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
Spooky Hellish Night is popular as hell!

268
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,240
Their videos all hit a million views!

269
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,400
Tong, have you heard of it?

270
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,800
It's a show about spooky stories.

271
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
So you saw a ghost?

272
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,560
Then what happened?

273
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,440
It's been tormenting you?

274
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,840
That night, I was heading home.

275
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I felt like I was being followed.

276
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Gosh...

277
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,640
What made you believe
that a ghost was following you?

278
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
I heard a noise.

279
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
- A noise?
- Yes.

280
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,560
Oh!

281
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
'Spooky Hellish Night, '

282
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,400
a ghost story show on YouTube.

283
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
It's the talk of the town right now.

284
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,920
Phloengnathitorn is the host.

285
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,680
He's both handsome and scary.

286
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,800
Each night I watch him,

287
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
I can't help but get my heart racing.

288
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,680
Phloeng... what?

289
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Gosh...

290
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
Whatever. So what about it?

291
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,000
You guys know I hate ghost stories.

292
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,160
They sent an invite to be on the show!

293
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,480
Whoa! Congrats, Namo!

294
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Are they paying too?

295
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Of course!

296
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,800
Plus, they only want
the cream of the crop, you know?

297
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,280
No good profile, no spooky story,
no chance you'll be invited!

298
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,160
Whoa! My good friend's getting famous!

299
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
What? But the invited guest isn't me!

300
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Is it Tong?

301
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Seriously?

302
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,400
Did you submit my profile?

303
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Whoa!

304
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,600
Not you!

305
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,240
Win, they invited you!

306
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
- Me?
- Yeah!

307
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,560
I submitted your profile to them.

308
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,080
I wrote,
"The White Knight Seer with his Spooky Tales."

309
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,560
They said they want you
on the show tomorrow!

310
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,680
It'll be the first time 'Spooky Hellish Night'

311
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,000
has a fortune teller as a guest!

312
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,160
Shit!

313
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Whoa...

314
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,840
You must be over the moon right now.

315
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,600
No.

316
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,320
- You're shit, Namo.
- What the hell, dude?

317
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,576
- You didn't tell me a damn thing about this!
- Listen first!

318
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Tong, help me!

319
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
I got you work, damn it...

320
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,440
- Tong, I told you to help me!
- Quiet!

321
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,280
Just hear me out first.

322
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Stop fighting, guys.

323
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,240
The pay is very high.

324
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,776
Please go on the show.
I sent them your profile, man!

325
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
Yeah, you should go.

326
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,960
Help me convince him to go on the show.

327
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,800
- It's 10 A.M. tomorrow.
- Please go.

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Just do it.

329
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,760
What was he thinking?

330
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,320
Dragged me onto that show for what?

331
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
So damn annoying.

332
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,640
Please don't be mad at him.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
He meant well.

334
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,120
Seriously?

335
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,040
Meaning well by signing me up
for the damn show?

336
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
Are you really going to let this opportunity go?

337
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
You're good with words, Tong.

338
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,080
But you know that I'm afraid of ghosts.

339
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,760
A show like that is definitely full of them.

340
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
I know.

341
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,720
But consider this.

342
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,440
Each of your fortune-telling sessions

343
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
takes two to three hours,

344
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
and you only get paid 169 baht.

345
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,120
But telling a story on the show
for a few minutes

346
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,040
gets you 30,000 baht!

347
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
To make that much from just fortune-telling,

348
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,600
you'd have to shuffle cards
until you cramp up.

349
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,040
Please think this through.

350
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,320
Think carefully.

351
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
That's 30,000 baht in your pocket!

352
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Please go on the show.

353
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
What the hell are you saying?

354
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,600
You heard me.

355
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,080
And if it hits a million views,

356
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,080
they'll pay an extra 70,000!

357
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,160
That's 100,000 baht in total!

358
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,240
- 100,000 baht?
- Yeah.

359
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
So what's it going to be?

360
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,120
Are you accepting the offer?

361
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Fine.

362
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
- For real?
- I'll be on the show.

363
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
- Yes!
- Tell Namo for me.

364
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Absolutely. I'll do it for you.

365
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,880
You've made the right decision. Let's go!

366
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,160
Sadhu.

367
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,120
May this be a good night.

368
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Oops!

369
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Alright.

370
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
For the sake of work, money,

371
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
and my future.

372
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
It's this dream again.

373
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,200
You want it like this, huh?

374
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,080
You're safe now, Win.

375
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,280
Win.

376
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,760
Win?

377
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Win!

378
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Win!

379
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
Wake up! You're running late!

380
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Phloeng?

381
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Wake up, Win!

382
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,520
What?!

383
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Tohmorn?

384
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Why are you naked?

385
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,040
I told you not to
do mischievous things while I'm asleep!

386
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,520
Or else I won't cook
your favorite dish as an offering.

387
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm really sorry.

388
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,600
I just wanted to wake you up.

389
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,560
You can do that,

390
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
but not naked like this!

391
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,520
Well, I got bored of
showing the other ghosts my goods.

392
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
So this time, I want you to see them!

393
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm gonna let this pass for once.

394
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
Next time, I'll use enchanted rice on you.

395
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,240
Can you enchant us to fall in love, too?

396
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
Sure.

397
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,280
I'm...

398
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,440
People these days work too hard.

400
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,720
Please don't push yourself too much.

401
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,400
Take care of yourself, okay?

402
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,280
Now that's easier on the ears.

403
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,840
Just leave already.

404
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,560
I need to take a shower.

405
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,840
No peeking, okay?

406
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Oh, okay!

407
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Let's do this.

408
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Oh!

409
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,840
Today is Monday.

410
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,120
So the auspicious color that
makes the seniors adore me is...

411
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,440
Whoa...

412
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,280
It's not a brand-new company,

413
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,800
but they've got a good location and orientation.

414
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,640
And a lucky entrance attracting wealth.

415
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And not to mention...

416
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
The scent here...

417
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,400
Indian cork trees. A lot of them.

418
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
Who's that?

419
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Good morning.

420
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
What are you doing here?

421
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm here for a shoot.

422
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,760
It's just the two of you here?

423
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,680
Check in with the staff inside for a card, yeah?

424
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,080
You scared me, Toh!

425
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Wow, Win...

426
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
Are security guards these days
this good-looking?

427
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,600
And?

428
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm afraid I can't go inside with you.

429
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,440
The energy radiating from there is too hot.

430
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,800
I'd be dead again if I were to enter!

431
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Well...

432
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,640
I'll wait for you outside, okay?

433
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
- I'll be right around here.
- Mm.

434
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,760
My dear friend!

435
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,120
I said I'd come pick you up,
and you refused.

436
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,920
On your bike?

437
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,880
I'd rather walk here barefoot.

438
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520
You're a reckless rider.

439
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,600
Come on now.

440
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,040
Are you upset?

441
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,440
Here. I got you coffee.

442
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
- Thanks.
- Wait...

443
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,720
Why do your under-eyes look so dark?

444
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,840
Like you've been cursed or something.

445
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Watch what you're saying.

446
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,680
Did you ask your dentist on your last visit

447
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,480
to remove the filth from your mouth?

448
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm foul-mouthed to the core.

449
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,760
There's no way to remove it.

450
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

451
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,440
- Are you Master Win and his manager?
- Yes.

452
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,640
We're the White Knight Seer team.

453
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,600
This sleepy face is Master Win.

454
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,320
I'm Namo Wiriya, his manager.

455
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,160
Oh, and here's my business card.

456
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Here.

457
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,520
We provide fortune telling
and feng shui consultations nationwide.

458
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,880
If you're interested,
feel free to contact us 24/7.

459
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,560
Sure.

460
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,080
I'm Nokphaeng, Phloeng's manager.

461
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,080
Also the producer
and creative director of Siam Nithrarom.

462
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,120
Nice to meet you, Nokphaeng.

463
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,200
Nice to meet you as well.

464
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,640
Then, please come this way.

465
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,560
So, what kind of shows do they produce here?

466
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,040
The most famous one would be

467
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,600
'Spooky Hellish Night.'

468
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,160
Any other shows?

469
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,600
There's...

470
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,240
'Fiery Tongues, ' 'Gays Go Places, '

471
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,960
and 'Guess Who's Dead!'

472
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Dude.

473
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,760
That's Phloeng.

474
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,080
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

475
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,640
Why is he walking around dressed like that?

476
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,920
It's hot, I guess.

477
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,000
But, is his name just 'Phloeng, '

478
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,160
and his surname 'Nathitorn'?

479
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Nope, his name is Phloengnathitorn.

480
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,200
Phloeng is the nickname.

481
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,520
But his full name is
Phloengnathitorn Asvadevadhamasthitya.

482
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
Huh?

483
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Can you repeat that?

484
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,800
Phloengnathitorn Asvadevadhamasthitya.

485
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,040
Gosh.

486
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,480
Isn't that a bit too lengthy?

487
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,960
Any name is long
compared to yours, Win Wongsawat.

488
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,240
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

489
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,600
Oh, I'll be right back.

490
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,680
Hey, where are you going?

491
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,200
Don't worry. I'll be back in a flash.

492
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Whatever.

493
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,040
What are you doing, boss?

494
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,680
No. I'm not doing anything.

495
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
Don't you have work to do, Job?

496
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Of course, I do.

497
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,240
But why don't you approach him
if you're interested, boss?

498
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,480
You even got Nokphaeng
to invite him on the show.

499
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,720
Don't let this go to waste.

500
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,240
Nokphaeng agrees he's a lovely guy.

501
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
No comment.
I'm going back to work.

502
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,760
It smells so lovely.

503
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,360
Is this a special pillow to help with sleeping?

504
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Hello.

505
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,720
Are you Master Win?

506
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560
I am.

507
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

508
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,160
Right.

509
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,680
Please wait here for a bit.

510
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,760
Phloeng will be here soon.

511
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,640
So... I don't need to do any makeup?

512
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,160
Oh, no.

513
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,680
Today's session is a podcast.

514
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,480
No fancy stuff needed.

515
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,720
The crew didn't tell you that?

516
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
No...

517
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,680
Then, here's everything in brief.

518
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,120
So, Nokphaeng wants the show
to feel as natural as possible.

519
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,320
And I need to tell ghost stories, correct?

520
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Would a childhood story work?

521
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,000
Uh, no. You don't need to tell any stories.

522
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,240
What? Really?

523
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,040
We actually invited you here

524
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,600
as a guest clairvoyant expert.

525
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Huh?

526
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,600
A clairvoyant expert?

527
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,800
That's right.

528
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,520
Nokphaeng wanted new methods
to make the show more interesting.

529
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,480
So, he wanted someone
with special senses on the show.

530
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,440
The storyteller for this EP is Jaab.

531
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,080
He's going to share his story
about being cursed.

532
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,440
And your job

533
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
is to contact the spirits.

534
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,040
Contact the spirits?

535
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,120
But the crew invited me here
to tell ghost stories, didn't they?

536
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,720
Certainly not.

537
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
The project coordinator
clearly specified that

538
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Master Win will be contacting the dead
on behalf of the storyteller.

539
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,520
And...

540
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,120
Oh, Phloeng is here.

541
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,040
He'll explain further.

542
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,800
Hello, Master.

543
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm Phloengnathitorn.

544
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,920
Phloengnathitorn?

545
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,840
The one behind the summer scent.

546
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,080
Has Job already told you that
you'll be contacting the spirits?

547
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Yes.

548
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
He just told me that, actually.

549
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,360
Then, let's get to it.

550
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Hold on.

551
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,960
You're not going to tell me
Jaab's story in brief?

552
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,920
Oh, I've read it.

553
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,760
But... Job said

554
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,160
you'd tell me his story beforehand.

555
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,440
You'll be fine.

556
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm the host anyway.

557
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,000
You just go with the flow.

558
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
So, can I have tarot cards?

559
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Tarot cards?

560
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,120
Well, I'm a Tarot card reader.

561
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,600
To contact the spirits,
I need them.

562
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,360
Dude, if this EP goes live,

563
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,520
my career is gonna be in ruins...

564
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,040
Come on! You're exaggerating.

565
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,920
Everybody loves you, Win.

566
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,480
So, where were you
when I was doing the podcast?

567
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,480
I... didn't want to disturb you.

568
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,320
How about this? You wait here.

569
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,080
I'll get my motorbike and ride us home.

570
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Okay?

571
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,800
Fine.

572
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,440
So you end up riding home with me.

573
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Be back soon!

574
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,320
Excuse me?

575
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,440
What are you doing here, little guy?

576
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,200
Can you take me to Papa Phloeng?

577
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Phloeng?

578
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,240
Which Phloeng do you mean?

579
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,800
I don't know.

580
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,520
I only know Papa's name is Phloeng.

581
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,440
Is it this man?

582
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,160
Yes! It's him!

583
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,080
My Papa Phloeng!

584
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Hm?

585
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Phloeng...

586
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,040
He's keeping his son a secret?

587
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,280
Can you take me to him?

588
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,560
Of course.

589
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,120
Why can't I do that?

590
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,240
Let me take him to you.

591
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,240
Let's go, Yok.

592
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,800
Follow me.

593
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
You're still here?

594
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,440
What's this?

595
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,720
The Radiance of the Seven Gems?

596
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,480
It's the light of a highly virtuous person.

597
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
That would explain

598
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,440
why no ghosts could enter the building.

599
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Master?

600
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,600
Are you staring at my chest?

601
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,960
A highly virtuous soul...

602
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,840
(Directed by: Siwasit Phondongnok)

603
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and it says that it happens at 25.

604
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,920
That means I've made it, haven't I?

605
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,360
You need to seek help
from a highly virtuous individual.

606
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,760
Who is my karmic creditor,
that the Venerable Father told me about?

607
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Win...

608
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,760
No, you're still alive.
