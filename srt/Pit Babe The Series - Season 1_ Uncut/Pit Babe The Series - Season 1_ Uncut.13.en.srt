1
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,360
There's one more thing you should know.

2
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,960
Tony's No.1 product tomorrow night.

3
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,750
He is someone who can see the future.

4
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,850
Uncle, who exactly are you?

5
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,300
So what are these pictures?

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,820
Why are you stalking Babe?

7
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,530
I just want to know

8
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,210
my only son.

9
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,570
Now he is only good and bad.

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,500
Tomorrow night, Tony will hold a charity event for the foundation.

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,410
We can't miss tomorrow's event.

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,310
Way and I will try going into the work to see what we can do.

13
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,229
Ouch!

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Charlie.

15
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,970
Babe.

16
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,560
Are you okay?

17
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,990
Charlie.

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Charlie is really you, right?

19
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,280
I wasn't dreaming, was I?

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Charlie.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Charlie.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Charlie.

23
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,510
I miss you so much, Charlie.

24
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,820
Me too.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
I miss you, too.

26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
Charlie.

27
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,490
Charlie, please don't disappear again.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,810
Yes, I promise.

29
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,829
Charlie.

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Then it means

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,579
that my senses come and go

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,740
because you are not really dead.

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,250
And where were you before?

34
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,210
Why must you fake your death with me?

35
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,280
It's my fault, Babe.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,820
I think if I die

37
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,410
and Tony doesn't know that your special sense can return to you.

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,440
He will stop bothering our lives.

39
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,540
I want you to be happy.

40
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,390
I'm not happy.

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,840
The day you weren't here, I wasn't happy at all.

42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,470
I know, Babe.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
I won't disappear from you again.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
But…

45
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,050
but you're not dead yet.

46
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,829
So,

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,470
why does sense return to me?

48
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,980
I met someone.

49
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,760
He has a potion that can take away the special sense.

50
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,970
The moment I was recovering.

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,260
I injected it and it really worked.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,490
Babe, now I can be with you without having to absorb your senses.

53
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,370
Who is he?

54
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,550
It's a long story, but for now it's better to get away quickly.

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,670
Let's go.

56
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,030
Hurry up!

57
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,590
Oh hey, no.

58
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,570
No.

59
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,140
I won't run away.

60
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,910
Sir,

61
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,760
Babe goes upstairs.

62
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Go!

63
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,320
Babe, what are we looking for?

64
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,190
The evidence against Tony.

65
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,909
All the documents of his nominated T-World company

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,340
You try looking over there.

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,260
Here's Charlie, the laptop.

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,540
-Turn on.
-Can't turn on.

69
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,940
What are you doing?

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,159
You make an effort to come home

71
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,650
but you aren't thinking to say hello to this Daddy.

72
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
I still can't go.

73
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,260
Leave that for later, go.

74
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,810
What is it?

75
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,500
All the evidence against Mr. Tony.

76
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,490
North, Sonic, come quickly.

77
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,840
The price of this art has skyrocketed to 10 million baht.

78
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,130
If anyone would like to contribute to the fund, you can bid the price now.

79
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,740
Because our Chen Family Foundation
really wants to be a bridge of merit for everyone.

80
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,670
-11 million.
-11 million.

81
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,200
-12 million.
-12 million.

82
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,890
-15 million.
-15 million.

83
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,060
Now it's at 15 million.
Does anyone want to bid more?

84
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,510
It's already 15 million.

85
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,130
Then 15 million 1st time.

86
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,490
15 million 2nd time.

87
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,880
15 million 3rd time.

88
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,740
Congratulations to Mr. Pete.

89
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,070
Everyone probably already knows this.

90
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,450
That our Chen Family.

91
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,390
Raise children to grow up with quality.

92
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,190
How much have they grown up to be
a talented person and a good person in society?

93
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,410
But many people may still not know.

94
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,300
The best racer of Thailand such as

95
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Pit Babe.

96
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,830
He used to be a child of the Chen family as well.

97
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,750
Pit babe?

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Really?

99
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,540
Let me see

100
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,680
what's in the Flash Drive.

101
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,830
What?

102
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,670
You bastard!

103
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,340
He hurt this child.

104
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,299
This cock head! Good at beating dogs, dare only with children.

105
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,530
Come see me, Tony.
(Drag and drop video files)

106
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,570
(It will be private until you publish it.)

107
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,020
Good at beating dogs, dare only with children.

108
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,500
In brackets, say Tony.

109
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,730
(Description:Good at beating dogs.)

110
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
That's right.

111
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Upload now.

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,820
And today,

113
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,210
although Pitbabe was unable to appear in person,

114
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,290
But he also sent his racing dress up

115
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,430
for auction today.

116
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,100
For those who.

117
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,300
Made merit by donating money

118
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,790
And I assure you,

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,710
whoever wins the auction for this racing dress,

120
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Pit Babe

121
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,340
will personally deliver his suit.

122
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,060
Is it a special alpha in the Chen family's legend?

123
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right, this is the person Tony has kept for a long time.

124
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,230
Let's just say,

125
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,740
let's start bidding on Pit Babe's dress racing.

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,730
If so, let's start bidding at

127
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,620
10 million baht.

128
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,990
50 million.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,300
50 million, someone offered an additional 40 million.

130
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,050
70 million.

131
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,460
70 million on this side has already given
an additional 30 million in price.

132
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,380
-90 million.
-90 million. The back increased the price to 90 million.

133
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,650
Tony killed someone.

134
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Fuck!

135
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,180
What should we do?

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,310
Upload it now.

137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,440
Reveal him.

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
You will be hell to pay.

139
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,090
Fuck!

140
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,180
Badass!

141
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,370
What do you type?

142
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,970
Revealing.

143
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,870
Tony, the Chen Family Foundation

144
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,790
Revealing Tony,

145
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,850
cut off a child's head.

146
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,910
Cut off a child's head.

147
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,160
Now the auction price is 110 million baht.
Is anyone going to bid even more?

148
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,250
Do you guys really believe it?

149
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,040
That this is just a charity auction.

150
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,650
All of this

151
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,450
is nothing but a front

152
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,050
of the Foundation for Poor Children.

153
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,900
Aren't you all curious?

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,260
Why do these works of art

155
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,280
have millionaires bidding for 10 million or 100 million?

156
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,290
Because the true value is not in the art piece.

157
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,930
But it is a child.

158
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,730
Hey Jeff.

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,470
You can stop now.

160
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,970
These children were sold to millionaires.

161
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,960
Chen Family Foundation that creates an image of being a good person

162
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,970
In reality, it is just a place for human trafficking.

163
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,510
Don't accuse me, Jeff.

164
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,490
This is not true at all.

165
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,920
There is no evidence to confirm

166
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,460
what this person is saying.

167
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,170
Chen Family Foundation

168
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,460
was absolutely no way to taint it like that.

169
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,530
Close all entrances and exits.

170
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,120
Don't let anyone leave here.

171
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
-Yes.
-Acknowledged.

172
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,510
Who is going to stay here?
Are they crazy?

173
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,960
he police will come in droves.

174
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Stop it.

175
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
Hurry.

176
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,830
Sit down.

177
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Sit!

178
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,700
-Ouch.
-Sit down.

179
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,290
Grab all the remaining people.

180
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Yes.

181
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,750
There is Alpha, my beloved son,

182
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,710
and two Enigma's.

183
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,650
I'll take you guys with me.

184
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,280
Then I'll make you guys make money for me.

185
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,880
The kind that all of you will remember until the day you die.

186
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,470
-Hey.
-Huh?

187
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,990
-Hey.
-Huh?

188
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,550
Oops, Fuck!

189
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,810
-Hey.
-Ouch.

190
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,260
What the fuck is "Ouch" ? Come out here.

191
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,450
Sit down now.

192
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
I told you to sit.

193
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,690
I told you to sit down quickly, you bastard.

194
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,150
Why do I have to meet you so often?

195
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,690
Life looks like there's nothing to do.

196
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Do you love each other?

197
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,990
Hah!

198
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,850
Do you want to ask me something?

199
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,930
Before you guys couldn't ask.

200
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Hey! Winner.

201
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Please stop.

202
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,010
You don't mess around.

203
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Winner.

204
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,980
Hello friends.

205
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,310
All living together.

206
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,930
Will you give me love?

207
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,890
Charlie, get away.

208
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,970
Run away quickly.

209
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,010
I told you to run away.

210
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,110
Charlie.

211
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,040
Babe, be careful.

212
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,180
Charlie, don't go.

213
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Way!

214
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
Way!

215
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,610
Way!

216
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,870
Way!

217
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Way!

218
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Way!

219
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
You!

220
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,170
I fought hard to raise you from childhood until you grew up.

221
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,320
You dare to shoot me, Babe?

222
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,410
You don't have to claim gratitude at all.

223
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,390
You're just fooling people.

224
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,330
You fooled me.

225
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,430
You fooled Way.

226
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,610
You fooled everyone.

227
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,480
Today I'm going to put you in jail.

228
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,070
If you agree to be a good product for me from the beginning

229
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,590
You're probably much happier now than you are now.

230
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,480
I'll give you guys another chance.

231
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,620
If you guys agree to go with me.

232
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,980
I will release all of you.

233
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,900
Shut your mouth.

234
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,750
From an orphan

235
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,590
to a top racer,

236
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,180
deep down in your heart

237
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,290
you probably know

238
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,310
If you don't have me,

239
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,360
how did you get to this point?

240
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,800
You will always be the son I love the most.

241
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,410
Come back to our house, son.

242
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,070
We can start over, son.

243
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't have a badass father like you.

244
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,740
Will you give up on me, Babe?

245
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
You shot me.

246
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,680
You shot me now.

247
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
How to do it?

248
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,650
Hey!

249
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,850
Please stop.

250
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,490
Father.

251
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,400
Don't hurt anyone anymore.

252
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,110
Way!

253
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,150
Way!

254
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,230
Way!

255
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Way!

256
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,970
Way!

257
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Way!

258
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,650
I'm sorry.

259
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm sorry.

260
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,930
Way, you don't have to say it, you don't have to say it and get up.

261
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,390
Way!

262
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,180
Way!

263
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,640
I, I'm sorry, Babe.

264
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,460
Can you forgive me?

265
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,570
Way, I've never been angry at you.

266
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,620
I won't be angry at you anymore.

267
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,070
Come back with me.

268
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,070
You can come back with me quickly.

269
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,860
Whey, I'm begging you.

270
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,930
I can't go with you to the end, Babe.

271
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,310
After this, you have to move on by yourself.

272
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,770
Way.

273
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,750
Don't you say like that.

274
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,540
You mustn't say that, you must stay with me, understand?

275
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,170
I love you, Babe.

276
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,970
I have never lied to you about this.

277
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,450
And you?

278
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,090
Have you ever loved me?

279
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Way,

280
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,250
you are the best friend in my life.

281
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,350
I swear.

282
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,890
You are my best friend.

283
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,380
I want the two of us to be like this forever.

284
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,800
Can you please don't leave me?

285
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,590
No matter what happens.

286
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,560
I'll be by your side forever, Babe.

287
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,260
I'll be by your side forever.

288
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,430
Way, Way, Way.

289
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,470
Way, Way.

290
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,380
Way, I love you. I love you, Way!

291
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,620
Way, I love you.

292
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,200
Way.

293
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Way.

294
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Way.

295
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,770
Way.

296
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Way.

297
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,690
Can you stay with me?

298
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Way.

299
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,570
Uncle.

300
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,090
Feeling sad?

301
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,290
Umm.

302
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,510
It's sad.

303
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,070
Way has been with me for almost 10 years.

304
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,380
After all, he is one of my younger brothers.

305
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm sorry.

306
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Sorry,

307
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,740
what are you sorry about?

308
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,760
That I never told you or anyone else.

309
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,070
I've seen this image in my head.

310
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm not courageous enough.

311
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,720
I kept praying that what I saw was wrong.

312
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
But…

313
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,550
it did happen

314
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,190
Don't blame yourself, Kid.

315
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,030
No one wants this to happen,

316
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,160
believe me.

317
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,250
I know.

318
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,340
You did your best

319
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,160
to prevent it from happening.

320
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,460
But sometimes,

321
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,690
we can do our best just like this.

322
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,150
The rest has to be let go.

323
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,220
We just have to

324
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,860
live the rest of our lives as best we can

325
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,550
for those who have left.

326
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
Hello.

327
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,590
You will always be my dearest friend, forever, Way.

328
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,920
If there really is a next life,

329
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,510
I hope we meet again.

330
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,240
Shall we go get something to eat, Babe?

331
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,550
What do you want to eat?

332
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,910
I can eat just about anything.

333
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,040
Do you want to eat something special?

334
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
No,

335
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,980
during this time I don't want to eat anything.

336
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,250
If it were me, you wouldn't want to eat it.

337
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,530
You don't have to try to make me smile that much.

338
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,720
I want to make you smile.

339
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,970
I'd like to smile.

340
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,350
Even though Tony's problems are over,

341
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,840
but it's like there's something stuck in my mind.

342
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,990
About Uncle Reval's?

343
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,690
If it were Babe I knew,

344
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,220
he definitely won't run away from problems.

345
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,490
I really mean it.

346
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,870
You are…

347
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,670
stronger than you think.

348
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,910
Uncle Rewal wants to meet you.

349
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Do you still remember, son?

350
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,760
Over there,

351
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,780
there used to be Dad's old TV.

352
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,490
Why can't I remember?

353
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,230
Dad, you like to sleep in front of the TV.

354
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,020
And then let me watch the movie alone.

355
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,810
And you always fall asleep.

356
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,150
I had to carry you

357
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
back to bed.

358
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Hmm.

359
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,179
I saw that Charlie

360
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,199
said that you...

361
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,860
Want to meet me?

362
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,710
That's right.

363
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,010
I still don't understand.

364
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,340
Why did you do that?

365
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
You leave a 7-year-old child.

366
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,020
Keep thinking that his father has died.

367
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,340
I had to go to an orphanage.

368
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,440
Deceived by them and taken advantage of.

369
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
How did you do that? May I ask, Dad?

370
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,810
Don't you love me at all, Dad?

371
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
Dad...

372
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,110
You left your only son

373
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,910
to live his life

374
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,430
alone.

375
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,700
Until he thought no one wanted him anymore.

376
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
You know what?

377
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,050
Nowadays, I can't trust anyone.

378
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,590
I don't think that in this life,

379
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,820
there will be someone who can truly love each other.

380
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,020
I've never forgiven you for a day.

381
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,890
I understand all your anger.

382
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,130
I don't blame you for anything.

383
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,580
I just, don't want you to be responsible for my stupidity.

384
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,550
Isn't your child

385
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,570
seriously ill in the hospital right now?

386
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,170
Don't worry.

387
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,290
Our Chen Family Foundation

388
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,100
will take the best possible care of him.

389
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,580
I just found out that I was tricked by Tony.

390
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,960
(This area is in the possession of
of T-World Company, trespassing is strictly prohibited)

391
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,520
I had to make that decision

392
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,950
I couldn't stand seeing you go hungry

393
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,880
for even a single meal.

394
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
You didn't think to ask me a single question?

395
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,810
Have you ever thought of consulting me?

396
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,640
So you think I can stand that pain?

397
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,220
That child is only 7 years old, Dad.

398
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,030
Since then, I have always followed you.

399
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm so sorry, Babe.

400
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,400
I admit all my faults.

401
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,040
I don't want to live my life with sediment in my heart anymore.

402
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,690
I want to throw it all away.

403
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,700
I'd like to start over.

404
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,200
I may not be able to completely forgive you now.

405
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,640
But it's not that I'm not happy that you came back to me again.

406
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,630
Hey!

407
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,680
Thank you, son.

408
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,840
Thank you very much.

409
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,460
I've been waiting for this day for a very long time.

410
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,230
Dad

411
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,840
won't go anywhere again.

412
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,160
Wake up, uncle.

413
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,170
-Huh.
-Wake up now.

414
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,080
Can I sleep a little longer?

415
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,630
Not anymore, uncle.

416
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,180
How many days have you been in my room?

417
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,430
Don't you want to go back to work at the garage?

418
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,470
By now, it's probably all a mess.

419
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,270
-Come quickly and get up.
-Let me sleep a little longer.

420
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,620
Get up quickly, uncle.

421
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,940
I haven't gotten up yet.

422
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,480
Get up quickly.

423
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,550
Get up.

424
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,450
-Come here.
-Ouch.

425
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,970
Oh, it's okay.

426
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,870
Let North and Sonic take care of it for me.

427
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,820
Please take another day off.

428
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,210
Ok, that's fine.

429
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,740
But I'll let you stay for just one more day.

430
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,320
Huh.

431
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,780
Tomorrow morning, hurry back home.

432
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Fine.

433
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,260
Then, shall we go somewhere?

434
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't want to go out.

435
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,830
Oh, why?

436
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,880
I want to be with you.

437
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,440
But, if we were in the room, what would we do?

438
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,480
Well,

439
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,770
it's up to you

440
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,790
that what you want to do.

441
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,990
Hey Uncle!

442
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,690
Uncle, what are you going to do?

443
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Uncle.

444
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,050
Uncle.

445
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,260
This is Mr. Kim, a new racer but an old face of X- Hunter.

446
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,810
Today, entering the field for the first race, how do you feel?

447
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,370
North, I told you not to bother him, he is serious.

448
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,100
What is this?

449
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,410
What?
Our team's racers are mostly Indy guys.

450
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,690
Alan.

451
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,590
Where did Babe go?

452
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,530
Where can he go?

453
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,090
He has to go do focus.

454
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,770
There is also something like this.

455
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,020
Papa!

456
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
What's babe?

457
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,470
Seriously?

458
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,420
Hurry!

459
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,900
Papa won't waste Mama's time.

460
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,620
Mama, what are you doing?

461
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,720
Mama, are you going to take it like this?

462
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,770
-So sweet.
-Woo hoo.

463
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,840
-So sweet.
-Go.

464
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,800
What's the matter, Charlie?

465
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,030
Babe.

466
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,260
What's up?

467
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,330
I love you.

468
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,880
Charlie?

469
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,180
So many people!

470
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,270
I have always loved only you.

471
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,630
And it will be like this forever.

472
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,240
I really love only you.

473
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
Hmm.

474
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,810
I already know.

475
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,260
I love you too, Charlie.

476
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,370
I love you very much too.

477
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,870
I love you like I've never loved anyone like this before.

478
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Do you understand?

479
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,300
I'm shy for him.

480
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,860
When will someone do this to me?

481
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
How is it?

482
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,150
I intended to have a picnic theme that teenagers would like.

483
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,990
Why?

484
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,040
Don't you like it, kid?

485
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,200
You definitely don't like it.

486
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,960
If that's the case, we can move to the restaurant.

487
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,810
You don't have to move.

488
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,270
I like.

489
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,410
You're so cute, uncle.

490
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,430
I'm cute to you, aren't I, kid?

491
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,370
I congratulate you on your success.

492
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,650
Both work at the garage

493
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,200
and have to study at the same time.

494
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,930
But you can still graduate with first class honors.

495
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,530
I'm so proud of my Boyfriend.

496
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,680
My little boy.

497
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,470
Jeff.

498
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
Congratulations!

499
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,760
I'm proud of you.

500
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,050
Thank you, Bro.

501
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,610
Oh, Alan.

502
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,800
Are you going to celebrate graduation or propose?

503
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,820
Hey Babe!

504
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,400
It's not like that.

505
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,840
I just wanted a change of scenery.

506
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,450
It's ok.

507
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,160
Alan also has a sweet and cute side.

508
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,530
Why don't you do cute things for me?

509
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,590
Charlie.

510
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,450
Why do you cause me to feel shame here?

511
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,090
Well, you look at what Alan did.

512
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,910
I'm already disappointed.

513
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,700
I already slighted.

514
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,240
(I told you to get up, why didn't you get up?)
Get up, get up.

515
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,950
(When got up it was like this.)

516
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,100
(I want revenge)

517
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,710
Please help me testify.

518
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,580
That the wound is all over my face here.

519
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,730
Benzalert gives it to me.

520
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,190
(Are you a snitch?)

521
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
(Today Daddy looks serious.)

522
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,590
(Top Ten is already shocked)

523
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,890
I really want a gun.

524
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,360
(Don't let Uncle complain.)
Why don't you grab it?

525
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,980
(It's almost good, Nut.)
Don't leave me and stay with me.

526
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,030
Cut!

527
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,020
Do you really want me dead?
