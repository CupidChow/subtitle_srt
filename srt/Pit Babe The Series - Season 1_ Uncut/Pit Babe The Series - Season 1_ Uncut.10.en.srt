1
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,100
I was an orphan in the Chen family.

2
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,289
I'm Enigma.

3
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,880
Tony's Enigma is Way.

4
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
You damn bastard, Way!

5
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,000
How dare you do this to me, Way?

6
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,110
I believe this method is the best way.

7
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,510
Just do as Daddy says.

8
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,350
Can I now call myself Alan's Boy?

9
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,760
What if I had a plan to bring Charlie back to this house?

10
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,670
Anyway, now Way isn't on our team.

11
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,979
So I'll let Dean race instead.

12
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,550
You're the only reason I'm here.

13
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,580
Charlie still follows closely behind.

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,830
Winner took first place, followed by Charlie from Team X-Hunter.

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,460
What's the matter? Why did you come to my house?

16
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,750
I have something to talk to you.

17
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
Huh!

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,630
What's the matter?

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,329
So urgent that you have to come to my house? We'll meet tomorrow.

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,780
I'd like to race tomorrow.

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
What did you say?

22
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Come on, Babe.

23
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,460
I thought we were done talking about this.

24
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,900
You should respect my decision.

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,100
Because of that, I'm here to ask you to make another decision.

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,310
I really have a headache with you, Babe.

27
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,120
Why are you so stubborn?

28
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
You look at your condition right now and your leg still hasn't healed.

29
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,030
Why do you force yourself to go to the race?

30
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,310
Because racing is what I love.

31
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,510
Alan.

32
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,780
You've known me all my life. You know better than anyone else

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,920
that I can't let anyone winning the championship
in front of my eyes without doing something.

34
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,400
If my hands can still hold the steering wheel
and my feet can still press the gas pedal,

35
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,200
then please let me race.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Babe.

37
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,170
Babe.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,870
Babe, why are you doing this?

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,560
You can't race.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,360
I've decided, Charlie, I'm going to race.

41
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,170
And you don't have to try to stop me.

42
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,610
How can I not stop you? It's dangerous, you know?

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,130
Your body is not ready yet.

44
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,510
You've said this a hundred times but I know my body.

45
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,220
I am the king of this field.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,630
I created this team along with Alan.

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,310
I won't let it be ruined because of this.

48
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,330
Alan.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,050
Can you say something?
You're the captain of the team.

50
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,920
I don't agree with Babe either.

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,100
But he's made up his mind and I can't resist him.

52
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,070
What is this?

53
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
Why does everyone see this as not being serious?

54
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,680
Practicing for this round could be deadly.

55
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,490
Charlie,

56
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,159
please take it easy.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,170
Babe just hurts his ankle.

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,710
At most, it's just chronic pain, not fatal.

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,830
So, do I think you're too serious?

60
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,990
Let Babe try it out first.

61
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,770
If he can't take it, Uncle won't let him race next time, right?

62
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,200
Well, that's it.

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,420
But if anything happens, Babe won't have any special sense to help.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,980
What's wrong with you, Charlie?

65
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,190
You don't want me to race

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,900
because you don't trust in my skills, right?

67
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,210
Do you think that if I don't have special sense then I will lose?

68
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,920
It's not like that.

69
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,420
Well.

70
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,410
You don't have to use your good wishes to decide
what I should or shouldn't do,

71
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,360
Even though you should be someone who believes in me,

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,890
and trusts me.

73
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,560
I would like to bring everyone to the competition of The Hallow field.

75
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,340
We have arrived at the final round of the season.

76
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,650
And the person who passed the qualifying round with the best time

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,320
in this round was Winner from the Red Racing Team.

78
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,790
The 2nd and 3rd places are

79
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,550
Charlie and Dean from Team X-Hunter.

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,140
And another surprise from this race.

81
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,520
No one thought that he would be able to come back after his big accident.

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,630
The King of The Hallow stadium, Pit Babe.

83
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
Are you okay?

84
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,590
It's not okay at all.

85
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,150
Why does Babe have to be so stubborn today?

86
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,750
So what do you do next? Will you stop?

87
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,040
You know that this cannot be stopped.

88
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,890
This might be our only chance.

89
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,120
Then you have confidence in yourself, you can do it.

90
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,000
The only way we can do this is to keep going.

91
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,500
Everything must end.

92
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,760
In this match, our X-Hunter will have Babe, Dean, and Charlie.

93
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,030
Both of them are new.

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,230
But the highlight for us in this race was

95
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,180
our Pit Babe taking off last.

96
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,430
Then let's see our Pit Babe King of the hallow.

97
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,909
That he will be able to conquer this field or not?

98
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,390
Let's start now.

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
Three, two, one.

100
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,659
It's already started.

101
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,690
Winner is still in the lead.

102
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,300
Charlie tried to chase him up.

103
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,810
Winner tried to block him.

104
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,250
Charlie tried to find a way to overtake him.

105
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Look, Charlie is chasing him.

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,530
-Charlie has come, Charlie has come.
-Charlie is chasing him.

107
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,470
Winner still blocks well.

108
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,260
Winner is still in the lead, followed by Charlie and Dean.

109
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,600
And now the Pit Babe who was the last to start is coming up.

110
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,370
Unbelievable.

111
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,570
Zig zag zig zag up from behind until he was in the middle.

112
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,810
Pit Babe is now ranked 4th.

113
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,850
The X-Hunter team is now in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place.

114
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,850
Now Pit Babe is trailing behind Dean.

115
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,169
-Now there's only Winner from Red Racing left.
-He has come up.

116
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,280
Pit Babe has overtaken. Pit Babe has overtaken.

117
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,429
-Now he has surpassed Dean.
-Chasing Charlie right away.

118
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,780
-Now Pit Babe is following Charlie up.
-What is this?

119
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,720
Slipstream, Slipstream.

120
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,810
Now Pit Babe has arrived at Charlie's place.

121
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,710
Now he has surpassed Charlie.

122
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,040
Right now, number 1 is still Winner from Red Racing,
followed by Pit Babe from the X Hunter team, followed by Charlie and Dean.

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,580
Babe tries to find space but Winner still blocks well.

124
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,090
Now it's very close.

125
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,170
Winner can still block, but Pitbabe won't let him.

126
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Babe, fight him.

127
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,480
Pit babe got up to the same level.

128
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,300
Now they're crowded around the curve.

129
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
It's the last curve, Babe.

130
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Now entering the final curve.

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Here it is!

132
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,410
Now driving in tandem has come up.

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,830
Passed Winner on the final straight.

134
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,510
-How come! How come!
-He's here. Now he's been overtaken, Winner.

135
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,020
Keep watching.

136
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,410
-Keep watching.
-Charlie kept his distance.

137
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,320
Charlie still follows Winner.

138
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,190
This moment!

139
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,710
This curve.

140
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,190
Charlie is now off the curve.

141
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,230
-There has been an accident in the field and now officials are charged.
-Charlie.

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,310
Charlie.

143
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,150
Hopefully no one will be hurt.

144
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,990
Babe.

145
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,720
Charlie fell off the track.

146
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,570
Huh!

147
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
What do you say?

148
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,050
Charlie fell off the track.

149
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,650
Charlie.

150
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Charlie.

151
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,130
I will never hurt you.

152
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,650
You know that

153
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,700
no matter what happens,

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,130
you're the reason I'm here.

155
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,190
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,940
I have followed my plan.

157
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,570
It's time for Daddy to do as you promised too.

158
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,620
It looks like they are following the plan we told them to do.

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Humph!

160
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,570
In the end, they couldn't escape.

161
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,740
Then they had to crawl to me.

162
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,640
You hurry and bring them back to me as soon as possible.

163
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,240
And what about the deal you made with Jeff?

164
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Just do that.

165
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,950
People like me

166
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,810
have never broken a word with anyone.

167
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,010
Yes.

168
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,770
Relatives can't enter.

169
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,690
Charlie.

170
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,210
Car accident on the race track.

171
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,080
The ecg machine and defibrillator were prepared.

172
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,050
Give me adrenaline.

173
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,230
On the left.

174
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,110
-Just put the breathing tube in here.
-Now the pressure has dropped.

175
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,630
I can give it back to you.

176
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,950
If I die, the senses I extracted will automatically return to their owners.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,300
Doctor, the patient has no pulse.

178
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,580
Doctor, how is my Boyfriend's condition?

179
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,850
How is my Boyfriend?

180
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,490
The patient was very seriously injured before arriving at the hospital.

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,550
I've tried to help as much as I can.

182
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,660
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,790
Charlie.

184
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Charlie.

185
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,610
Sorry.

186
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,910
I'm sorry I always talked bad to you.

187
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,690
Please help me go find the doctor.

188
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,360
He's still warm.

189
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,900
Charlie must not be dead yet.

190
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Charlie.

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,110
Why don't you wake up, Charlie?

192
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,050
Oh hey!

193
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,920
Doctor, please help me, doctor.

194
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,830
Babe.

195
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,330
Babe, did you hear that? Babe.

196
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,290
-Babe.
-Doctor.

197
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,760
Doctor, Dean, go get the doctor.

198
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,500
Doctor Doctor!

199
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,860
-Babe.
-Doctor.

200
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,910
Babe.

201
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,730
-Babe.
-How are you, Babe?

202
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
Doctor!

203
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,520
I asked you to bring him here, not to kill him.

204
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,870
But that accident shouldn't have killed Charlie.

205
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,380
I checked everything very well.

206
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,150
There must definitely be something wrong.

207
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,090
You said that people with special sense like Charlie recover quickly?

208
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,190
So why did he die?

209
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,940
Answer me now, Kenta.

210
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,070
How many more mistakes will you make?

211
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,720
When Babe had sense, you couldn't bring him.

212
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,840
When Sense went to be with Charlie, you made him die again.

213
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,930
And now do you know?

214
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,020
How many hundred million has the market price of Charlie gone up?

215
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,570
And if he dies like this, what will I do next year's auction?

216
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,350
You really are the worst, the worst.

217
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,480
You quickly go and bring as many orphans with special senses as possible.

218
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,720
No matter if you have to turn the sky and the earth.

219
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,060
I have to get a kid with a special sense like Babe.

220
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes.

221
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,570
Wait a minute.

222
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,910
If you still make mistakes in this life,

223
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,550
you don't have to come back.

224
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,089
Uncles, uncles.

225
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,099
How are you?

226
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,270
You fainted but the doctor said it was nothing serious.

227
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,390
So I had North and Sonic take you home.

228
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,150
-Babe.
-Where are you going?

229
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,610
I'll go see Charlie.

230
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,520
There's no use in going now.

231
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,920
Jeff has taken care of everything.

232
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,810
Do you have any headaches?

233
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,400
Are you feeling hot or uncomfortable?

234
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Are you not feeling well?

235
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,010
-Do you have a fever?
-Do you have any headaches?

236
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,390
Go get him some pill.

237
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Pill.

238
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
Hey, take it easy.

239
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,860
How are you?

240
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,670
Uncle.

241
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,220
What's wrong with Babe?

242
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I don't know.

243
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,530
Suddenly he had a headache.

244
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,160
It's not that I suddenly feel pain.

245
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,360
Now everything in my head is loud and buzzing.

246
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,090
Suddenly it came back and I couldn't take it.

247
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,290
Can you hear everything?

248
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,290
What does that mean, Babe?

249
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,460
Have you gotten all your senses back?

250
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,870
Charlie.

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,630
He is a special Alpha.

252
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,430
If he is close to anyone.

253
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,500
He will take away that person's senses.

254
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,510
That my senses are gone.

255
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,170
It wasn't because of an accident.

256
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,120
But it was because of Charlie.

257
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,390
And now my senses.

258
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,070
It will come back to me when

259
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,580
Charlie dies.

260
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,300
I don't want my senses back.

261
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,230
I don't want anything back.

262
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Take it easy.

263
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,790
I just want Charlie back.

264
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,160
Are you sure you won't let us sleep here?

265
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,740
You go back, I can be alone.

266
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,460
If you don't feel good, call me.

267
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,460
Please take care of yourself.

268
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Hmm.

269
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,130
-Everyone go, I'm okay.
-I'm back home.

270
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,550
My name is Charlie, I've been a fan
of the X-Hunter team and Babe for a long time.

271
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,790
I'll let you be a Babe's boy.

272
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,270
Am I really a Babe's boy?

273
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,610
I will be your friend, I will be good to you.

274
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,030
I'll take care of you until you're bored of me.

275
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,500
At first I was going to give it after the race was finished.

276
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,180
Is it engraved with my name?

277
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,270
Yes!

278
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,150
Thank you, Babe.

279
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,100
I can do it.

280
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
What?

281
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,880
Charlie!

282
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,210
Babe,

283
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,060
even if you don't have any special sense.

284
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,760
But you will always be special to me.

285
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,710
You know, right?

286
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,400
No matter what happens, you are the only reason I am here.

287
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,550
I'm willing to die for you.

288
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,510
I shouldn't have sent you to your death, Charlie.

289
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,990
I'm okay.

290
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,540
So Babe hasn't arrived yet?

291
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,120
I've called several times but he hasn't answered the phone.

292
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,680
That's it, come over there, uncle.

293
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,870
Charlie!

294
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,500
I have come to see you.

295
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,580
I brought your gloves.

296
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,350
I remember every time you wore these gloves.

297
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,350
You like to pretend to smile and

298
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,200
think you're the coolest.

299
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Charlie!

300
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,630
I want to keep these gloves.

301
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,690
May I have it please?

302
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,690
I don't want to forget you.

303
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,000
I miss you.

304
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,680
You will always be in my heart, Charlie.

305
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,280
I love you

306
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,980
Go back and rest first.

307
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Babe.

308
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,150
Let's go.

309
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,430
Stay with me, you don't have to force it, you can be weak sometimes.

310
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,010
You don't have to be strong all the time.

311
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,670
Tonight, go stay at my house.

312
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,080
Who suddenly goes to live in someone else's house?

313
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,380
How can I trust you to go back to being alone?

314
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,350
I don't want you to get distracted.

315
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,650
Now that there's no Charlie,

316
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,080
a time like this isn't good being alone.

317
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,620
If you don't feel comfortable being alone with me

318
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,540
I'll have North and Sonic come stay with us.

319
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,350
That you've been saying for a long time.

320
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,190
So, in conclusion,

321
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,670
you will let me go to your house, right?

322
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Hmm.

323
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,840
I won't let you go back to the cave again.

324
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,360
Can you let me take care of you?

325
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,810
It's up to you.

326
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,080
But can I ask you one thing?

327
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,520
Uncle North Sonic.

328
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
Please help.

329
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,570
Oh hey!

330
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Slow down.

331
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Sonic!

332
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,570
Take him to rest inside first.

333
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,630
Okay.

334
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,030
OK, uncle.

335
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,790
Now can you tell me what happened?

336
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,700
How could Kim be with you?

337
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,850
He was locked up here by Tony.

338
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,740
I mean, I have a spy in Tony's house.

339
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,550
Someone messaged me that Tony had decided to release Kim.

340
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,340
When I found out, I immediately went out to look for him.

341
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,840
So I took him to my condo first.

342
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,170
But I think having Kim here is safer from Tony right now.

343
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,200
I don't know when Tony will go crazy again.

344
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,080
Am I bothering you too much?

345
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,980
Hey, it's okay.

346
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,270
Don't think like that. It's good that you have something to say.

347
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,180
You're getting better now, kid.
If you have something, you can ask for help like this.

348
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,770
I only do it with you.

349
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,700
No matter what, I have to help you.

350
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,530
Well, we are really one family, right?

351
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,430
Whatever you say, I say so.

352
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,350
Go, go into the house.

353
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,830
Is it better?

354
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,870
Hmm.

355
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,910
Why did you guys help me?

356
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:08,350
How can we not help? You were hurt like this by Tony.
No matter who you are, we can't stay still.

357
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,190
In the field, you and I may actually be competitors.

358
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,540
But in real life you and I have the same enemy.

359
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,950
That's Tony.

360
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,560
I don't know how you escaped.

361
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,570
Or why did Tony intend to let you out?

362
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,920
But now that you're here, you're part of the X-Hunter family.

363
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,250
After all, we are racing drivers too.

364
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,780
In the field they may be enemies.

365
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,170
But off the field, I hope you'll keep an open mind.

366
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,850
And be friends with all of us.

367
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,150
Let's recover quickly.

368
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,100
Uncle has prepared some personal items for you.
If you need anything else, just tell me.

369
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,930
Thank you for your help.

370
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I promise.

371
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,370
No matter what I have to do,

372
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,970
I will help you get rid of that bastard Tony.

373
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,200
You could be here forever.

374
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Yes.

375
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,490
Before, you always had Charlie with you, right?

376
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,540
Now there's no Charlie.

377
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,240
You still have me.

378
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Alan.

379
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,780
What exactly do you think of me?

380
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Well,

381
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,630
what do you want me to be?

382
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,910
You're as old as an uncle.

383
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,850
I'm deciding whether to be an Alan's Boy or not?

384
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,890
You probably don't know how to flirt with anyone.

385
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,700
I tried to give this a chance and it still didn't work out.

386
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,490
So do you want to be Alan's Boy?

387
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,880
If so, does there have to be a probationary period
and expiration like Babe's?

388
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,520
There's no expiration date.

389
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,330
It can be continued every year.
Then I will make a points card for you as well.

390
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,670
Interested in becoming a lifetime member?

391
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,400
If so, when I can decide, I'll tell you.

392
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,199
What is it, uncle?

393
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,940
Is this Jeff kissing your cheek?

394
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,650
North, why are you so loud?

395
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,670
Nothing, keep working.

396
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,410
North!

397
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,730
You're so slow till the Boy attack first like this, it still looks clumsy.

398
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Oh!

399
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,760
I don't flirt with talented people like Babe and Way.

400
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,980
Just say it.

401
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,550
Lately, our garage is looking more and more lonely.

402
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,760
Whey has already left.

403
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,490
Dean doesn't talk to us as much as usual.

404
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,790
As for Babe and Charlie...

405
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,850
Garage without Babe is nothing like X-Hunter.

406
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,230
Didn't the two of you see Babe go into the garage?

407
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,330
I must say that since Charlie passed away.

408
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,410
I didn't see Babe anymore.

409
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,280
I sent a message to the group and they didn't answer.

410
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,800
Called to invite him to eat, but he didn't answer.

411
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,210
Yes!

412
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,450
I don't know if he ever left the house.

413
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,650
I'm afraid he will die of heartbreak.

414
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,530
Babe.

415
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Babe.

416
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Babe.

417
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Where are you?

418
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,850
Babe.

419
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Babe.

420
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,950
Babe.

421
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,350
Babe.

422
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,960
What are you doing?

423
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,450
Babe.

424
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Enough

425
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,610
That's enough.

426
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,330
Babe.

427
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,230
Get up and sit down.

428
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,030
Babe.

429
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,380
Babe.

430
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,250
Please be conscious.

431
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,490
Babe.

432
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,480
Babe, please be conscious.

433
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,110
I just want to know how this happened.

434
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm sure it's because of Tony.

435
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,230
But we were extremely careful.

436
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,220
But I don't understand how it happened.

437
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,930
If you want to get revenge on Charlie

438
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,090
Please get up and do something with your life first.

439
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,140
If Charlie found out that he was acting like this, would he be happy?

440
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,620
If you don't want to do anything for yourself.

441
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,570
Could you please think about doing it for Charlie?

442
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,620
But I won't do anything until I drag Tony to hell.

443
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,800
I understand.

444
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,100
But we don't have any evidence to pinpoint it.

445
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,090
And what's worse than having no evidence

446
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,700
is that he seems invisible inside our team.

447
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,490
I know how to get through to him.

448
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,670
What are you doing, Charlie?

449
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,670
I asked what you did to Charlie.

450
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,230
What's wrong with you?

451
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,860
Answer me, Way. Answer me!

452
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,630
I said I knew nothing.

453
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,790
I ask what did Tony tell you to do?

454
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,970
Hey, calm down.

455
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,700
-Hey!
-I said I knew nothing!

456
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,600
Oh, you don't know?

457
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,780
Answer me, Way!

458
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,840
I said I didn't do it.

459
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,970
Charlie's accident had nothing to do with me.

460
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,230
You can take me to swear anywhere you want!

461
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,900
Swear? Way. You swear?

462
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,220
You dare to swear, Way?

463
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,960
Stop your bullshits and tell me!

464
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,250
Deep down I’ve always felt guilty, Babe.

465
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,540
I never thought of lying or hurting you.

466
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,430
I know you love Charlie before you even realize it.

467
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,360
And do you think I can hurt the one you love?

468
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,030
Huh?

469
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,600
It's true that I hate Charlie,
but I never thought of harming our team.

470
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,290
I build X-Hunter together with you and Alan.

471
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,330
I couldn't hurt my own family.

472
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,140
Family?!

473
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
Hey.

474
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,350
You got the nerve to say “family”? Huh?

475
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,400
You destroyed that word a long time ago, Way!

476
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,160
Betrayal friend! Betrayal friend!

477
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,860
It must be an insider, Otherwise, he wouldn’t have access to Charlie’s car.

478
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,730
What do you mean by saying this?

479
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,030
It's about Charlie's race car.

480
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,650
The police found that the oil pipe had been punctured.

481
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,570
This is clearly intentional.

482
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,080
Checked the security cameras but didn't find anything.

483
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,020
So what would you interpret that?

484
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,260
But everyone on our team can be trusted.

485
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,210
So who could it be?

486
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,770
That's the tough thing.

487
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,410
You thought no one dared to harm you, right?

488
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,050
I know you are troubled that our team had a traitor,
but we must find the truth of this matter.

489
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,390
Not just for Charlie, but for everyone on the team.

490
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,910
Because if there’s really a mole on our team,
I definitely wouldn't stop here.

491
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,220
Only the three of us will know about this.

492
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,890
Let others think it was an accident.

493
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,380
Then let’s keep an eye on the teammates.

494
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Alan. Alan.

495
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,780
Hey, what's your plans for the next race?

496
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,400
The next race?

497
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,900
I haven't thought about it yet. And there's Charlie’s happening too.

498
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,770
I plan to do it again next season.

499
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,550
But this season, you still have me left.

500
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,550
Just because only Charlie died,

501
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,630
So everyone had to stop everything and mourn for him?

502
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,610
Stop it, Dean.

503
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,380
If you have something to do, go do it.

504
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,890
-But Alan...
-Dean!

505
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,460
Just go do what you need to, we'll talk about the race later.

506
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,120
Hello, I've done as you said.

507
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,970
When will you do what we agreed to?

508
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Then what?

509
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,930
That's fine.

510
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,820
I hope Red Racing doesn't disappoint me like what X-Hunter did.

511
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,460
Who are you talking to?

512
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,710
I ask who are you talking to?

513
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,250
Who are you talking to?

514
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,370
Answer me!

515
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
It's you, right?

516
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,870
You were the one who caused Charlie's death, right?

517
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,280
No, I'm not.

518
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,870
You can't accuse me groundlessly.

519
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,890
No, my ass! I heard everything you just said.

520
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,960
-Answer me!
-What's wrong with you!

521
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,740
Then let me see your phone. let me see it.

522
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,480
Hand it to me!

523
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Fine.

524
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,020
Keep this in your mind,

525
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,730
A scoundrel like you will never get away with it.

526
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,010
The police will check your phone.

527
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,860
And then put you in jail!

528
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,530
Babe.

529
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,430
You shouldn't have found this out.

530
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,520
Why it has to be you, Dean?

531
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,880
Yeah right, Why?

532
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,730
Why? Why don't you guys ever appreciate me?

533
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,930
How many years have I been here?

534
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,560
I endure it, trying to do everything.

535
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,370
But you guys never appreciate me.

536
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,300
Compared to Charlie who had only been here a few months.

537
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,620
Why do you guys pay so much attention to him?

538
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,790
Why?!

539
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,810
Answer me!

540
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,890
You had to go so far as to kill him?

541
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,500
I just want to teach him a lesson.

542
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,710
Let him leave this industry. I didn't plan to got him death!

543
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,290
And when I tell the truth,

544
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,550
You still don't believe me!

545
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,420
The thing I punctured was the brake fluid line.

546
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,340
Not the oil pipe.

547
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,240
I don't want things to be like this, Babe.

548
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,870
Dean...

549
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,400
But I have no choice.

550
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,950
-Dean!
-Dean!

551
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,860
Alan.

552
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,420
-Get up!
-Bastard!

553
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,390
Alan, you got me wrong.

554
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,590
It's not like that.

555
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,740
Like the hell it is!

556
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,650
You're thinking of killing him.

557
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,280
You're the one who punctured Charlie's car, right?

558
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,180
You are the one who caused Charlie's accident, right?

559
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,410
No. No, I'm not!

560
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,260
Bastard!

561
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,010
I didn't do it.

562
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,460
What did I do wrong when I didn't do it?

563
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,690
Alan, you know what?

564
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,140
You never appreciated me.

565
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,060
You've always seen others as good.

566
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,920
Even that kid, Charlie.

567
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,270
So I have to choose the best way for myself.

568
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,070
Tony made you do it, right? What did he agree to give you?

569
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,880
Make your dreams come true? Huh?

570
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,490
He just said

571
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,260
He would give me everything that X-Hunter never did.

572
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,410
Let me go, North.

573
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,240
And you believe someone like him?

574
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,030
Why don't you learn from Babe and Way?

575
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,460
Huh?!

576
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,580
Because I don't care, don't care at all!

577
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,790
Since there was no hope at X-Hunter anyway.

578
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,800
And be an underdog for the rest of my life.

579
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,920
Go ahead! Punch me!

580
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,550
Go ahead! just let me die.

581
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,910
Why don't you do it?

582
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,590
Dean, why are you so stupid?

583
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,230
Dean...

584
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,250
North, let me go.

585
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,590
Let me go, North.

586
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,700
If I don't do anything, don't stop me.

587
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,310
North.

588
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,670
Call the police.

589
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,690
Looking from Mars down to Earth, I still know.

590
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,300
That Jeff likes you too.

591
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,280
-Don't want to get to know each other a bit more?
-That's just first kiss.

592
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,460
I have a list of children who were sold by
the Chen family to millionaires in the country.

593
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,860
But still hard to catch Tony for human trafficking.

594
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,320
Only one that needs to watch out is Mr. Pete from Beyond Group.

595
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,250
Do you want me to do anything?

596
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,130
I'll handle it.

597
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,180
It's like we've hit a dead end again.

598
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,350
(quarreled among themselves.)

599
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,030
(Someone slick to hug him.)
Cheeky.

600
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,100
(But he knew.)

601
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,430
Oh, headbutt.

602
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,270
(Real brain drain.)
Maybe call an to call ambulance. Sit down.

603
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,530
(Nut got hit again.)

604
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,050
(Got revenge now.)

605
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,100
Cut.

606
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,750
(Exchange punch)
Right into my eye.

607
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,110
(Charlie, Please come comfort Babe.)
