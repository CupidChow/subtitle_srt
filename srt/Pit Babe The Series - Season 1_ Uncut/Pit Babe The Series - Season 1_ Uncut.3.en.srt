1
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,660
Excuse me.

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,400
Are you still look for a repairman?

3
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,340
Yes, we do.

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
I didn't apply for anyone.

5
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,610
I came to apply for this job.

6
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,530
It's Pit Babe.

7
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,060
You probably know him, right?

8
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,320
Kim, the new racer of the Red Racing Team,

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,350
From now on, people who are
unauthorized to the X-Hunter Team

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,050
I brought him myself,
Uncle didn't say anything.

11
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,310
Why serious?

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,670
Hello, Alan.

13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,180
I came to negotiate the purchase of racers
from the X-Hunter team.

14
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,420
Exchange with Pit Babe.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,030
I think it's not a bad offer.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,800
If only you would agree
to the terms of Babe's deal.

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,420
Your X-Hunters team could ask
for any additional tens of millions.

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,860
Mr. Tony doesn't mind.

19
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,000
As for this check,

20
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,100
I am giving it as a deposit.

21
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,860
But for the right to work and control Babe,

22
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,120
your X-Hunter team has to sell it.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,090
You have to give it all to us.

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,070
I suggest you take your money back.

25
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,180
Babe is not my stuff or property.

26
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,140
I work with him wholeheartedly.

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,850
I don't have the right to hand him over
to anyone if he is unwilling.

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,329
How can you be so sure

29
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,920
that Babe is unwilling?

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,430
Don't forget
that Babe knew Mr. Tony before you.

31
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,800
He is the one whom Babe

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,300
calls Daddy.

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,550
I think an outsider like you

34
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,630
shouldn't act too confident.

35
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,980
What's wrong, uncle?

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
Why do you look stressed?

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't tell me you're worried
about Red Racing.

38
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,780
I already told you not to worry.

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,540
No matter how much money,
If you don't have skills, it's useless.

40
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,180
It's not just that.

41
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,000
Today, they sent someone.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,650
Hah!

43
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,170
Did they send someone to you?

44
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,200
Yeah!

45
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,480
They came to make an offer to buy you.

46
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,870
How do you feel, Charlie, to be

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,250
Babe's boy for such a long time?

48
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,600
Feeling good.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,520
Do you have a secret story about Babe

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
to share with Ringside Racing fans?

51
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,920
North, if Babe finds out
that you teased his boy.

52
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,030
Babe, can you calm down first?

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,100
Hey, please stop.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
Babe, Hey!

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Babe!

56
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,310
-Babe, wait.
-What happened?

57
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,570
Hey!

58
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,350
Babe Babe!

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,250
Please wait for me.

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,370
Uncle,

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,280
what's wrong with Babe?

62
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,770
A Capitalist who asked to buy him
to put pressure on our team.

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,840
He couldn't stand so he went
to fight with them.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,130
You go tell your boss.
No matter how much money can buy me

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,990
And don't dare to be involved with Alan.

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,310
You've gone out and played enough,

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,660
when will you come home?

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,710
And why do I have to go back there?

69
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,380
Because you're the apple of Daddy's eye.

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,520
Daddy misses you a lot.

71
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,310
He misses me?

72
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,500
Well, it's his thing.

73
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,670
I've never missed him one bit.

74
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,300
Ah!

75
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,730
I'm not as tame as you.

76
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,540
When he commanded you,
you wagged your tail and followed.

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,710
I left you a message for Tony.

78
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,670
That he should stop trying.

79
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,450
Because I would never go back there again.

80
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,530
What are you doing?

81
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,290
Hey, kid.

82
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,450
It looks like this, but in the past
I overhauled the machine myself.

83
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes! If you're feeling stressed,
find something else to do.

84
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,050
Don't come to my job.

85
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,200
Can you see that?

86
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,980
I should find time to
meet with big investors

87
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,060
to get some money to back up our team.

88
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Our racers won't have
to stress out like this.

89
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,720
If you find investors, do you
still do what you want to do?

90
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,990
You'll have to be patient
with showing off or getting ads.

91
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,030
Including activities that
are not related to racing?

92
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,490
I really can't stand with that.

93
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,550
But whatever I do

94
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,010
may not be good for the team.

95
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,570
If they were with someone who was
willing to give their all and support them,

96
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,540
it would be better.

97
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,210
Like Babe, if he goes back
to live with his family.

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,720
Family is not everyone's safe zone.

99
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,420
If what you were doing wasn't good enough,

100
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,040
no racer would be with you until now.

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,200
Oh!

102
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,180
You can speak kind words
to consolidate others, kid.

103
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Huh!

104
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,270
What consolation?

105
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,330
How many times have I told you
that my name is Jeff, not Kid?

106
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh!

107
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,650
Oh hey!

108
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,230
People who came here in the beginning
were hard-hearted like this.

109
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,290
Just wait and see.
You'll be weak for a while.

110
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,590
Uncle will take you to get some snacks.

111
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,870
Go, go quickly.

112
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,780
Why do I eat so much? I'm already full.

113
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,420
Just let's go eat with me.

114
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,930
Way!

115
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,200
The cars I parked at your showroom
can all be sold.

116
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,710
Then take the money to Alan as well.

117
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,000
Told him I'd sponsor our team.

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,790
As much as UAC CORP invests in Red Racing,
I will give the same to our team.

119
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,820
Bebe, please calm down.

120
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,700
You don't have that much money.

121
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,130
And by the way, Alan still has money.

122
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,880
I know Alan has money.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,520
But I don't want him
to have to bear the burden.

124
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,870
Babe, don't think too much.

125
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,290
I know some rich high society people.

126
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,230
I'll help Alan.

127
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,980
So what are you going to do tonight?

128
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,830
Can you drive home?

129
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,290
Want to sleep in my room?

130
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,320
It's okay, your boy will be jealous of me.

131
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't have a boy, you know me, Babe.

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,910
That I've never had anyone else but you.

133
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,240
I'm just joking.

134
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,910
You go. I'll go home.

135
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,940
Then I'll take you home.

136
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,980
It's okay, I'll let Charlie stay with me.

137
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,610
Charlie.

138
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,720
Why do you come to work
in front of the house?

139
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,670
Why don't you go inside?

140
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,270
How do I get into the house?

141
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,460
You invited me to move in.

142
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,780
But you keep changing
your door code all the time.

143
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
So why didn't you call me and ask?

144
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,720
I don't dare to call you.

145
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,790
I don't know if you'd like
to pick up the phone.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,440
Or you might be annoyed with me.

147
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,550
Whatever matters,
you can handle it all by yourself.

148
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,960
So you told me not to bother,
can't I remember?

149
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,210
I'm Babe's boy,
but I can't do anything with Babe.

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,100
Well, actually I'm just a sex buddy.

151
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,370
I have no right to be involved with you.

152
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Hey!

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
Do you really have to overact like this?

154
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, I'm sorry.

155
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,490
You don't have to apologize to me.

156
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,420
You haven't done anything wrong.

157
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,980
But I don't understand

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
that you want me by your side

159
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,190
but don't let me understand you at all.

160
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,400
Do you really want to understand me?

161
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,810
Let's go, let's go into the house.

162
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,420
You know

163
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,870
what people like to say about me?

164
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,200
Pit Babe,

165
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,920
king of the field.

166
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,570
If we don't include changing sex buddies
like tissue paper.

167
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,490
You are a man
who fulfills three standards.

168
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,330
Divinely handsome.

169
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,680
Divinely skilled.

170
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,400
And extremely rich.

171
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,680
People these days just talk.

172
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,630
Even though they don't know anything.

173
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,220
But you have everything.

174
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I just had it when I was an adult.

175
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,210
When I was young, I didn't have anything.

176
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,990
Pit Babe that everyone knows

177
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,350
is just a fake image.

178
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,510
that was created.

179
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,450
Before, there were no Pit Babes.

180
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,490
There was only a boy

181
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,270
named Babe.

182
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,050
(The area of T World is strictly forbidden.
Otherwise, legal action will be taken.)

183
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,640
My father was defrauded and bankrupt.

184
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,510
We have to sell the house to pay off debt.

185
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,300
We have to come out and live
a wandering life.

186
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,600
However, I am still happy
to be with my father.

187
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,190
But one day my father left me.

188
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Her father isn't here anymore.

189
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,520
But it's okay

190
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,930
from now on...

191
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,930
Father gave me to the Chen family.

192
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,530
I will take care of you

193
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,080
There were many children there.

194
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,320
But we were raised separately.

195
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,750
I heard the voices of other children

196
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,090
but never saw anyone.

197
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,960
I've finished it.

198
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,620
Then I began to feel my own special sense.

199
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,330
They trained me to be more skilled
at using my special sense.

200
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,640
Until I grew up, I realized that

201
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,410
It was Tony

202
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,740
who swindled my father into bankruptcy.

203
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,140
Babe!

204
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,390
You are my favorite son.

205
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,820
You know how much I wish for you.

206
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,530
If you didn't have me that day,

207
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,870
what have you become?

208
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,770
Let me go.

209
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,349
The person who hurt me

210
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,079
is the person who gave me life.

211
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,580
After that I decided to escape.

212
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,840
Well...

213
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,410
Is it okay now?

214
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,330
That's okay.

215
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,740
It's been a long time since it happened.

216
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,580
One day, I'll probably forget it.

217
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,530
I just have to remind myself
not to think about it.

218
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,660
Don't trust anyone.

219
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,060
Don't love anyone.

220
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,730
There are no people

221
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,950
who approach and are nice to us
without expecting any benefit.

222
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,230
Is it true?

223
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,810
I am a person

224
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,370
who wants benefits from you.

225
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,780
Probably not including you

226
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,730
because I also benefit from you.

227
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,210
Treat it as killing time

228
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,450
until each other gets bored.

229
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm not bored with you.

230
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,360
I will be with you

231
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,250
and be nice to you.

232
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,240
I'll take care of you

233
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,010
until you're bored of me.

234
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,270
Until you chase me away, I'll go.

235
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,280
Is that so?

236
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,170
Then I'll wait and see.

237
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,810
Well,

238
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,560
if you want to stay here for a long time.

239
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,540
Keep trying to make me soft-hearted

240
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,570
Is this ok?

241
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,350
Okay.

242
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,760
Babe,

243
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,100
didn't you say we wouldn't kiss?

244
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,670
Well, I've changed my mind.

245
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,950
Don't you like it?

246
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,870
Kid.

247
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,590
Aren't you bored?

248
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,420
All day, you just tuned the car
and didn't talk to anyone.

249
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,030
And you ask me every day like this,
aren't you bored?

250
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm not going to give in to you.

251
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,170
Brother Alan, hey!

252
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,540
I would like to discuss the next match.

253
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,030
Do you know about the match program
at Bangsaen yet?

254
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,280
Huh.

255
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,970
I heard that it's a competition
to promote young rookies.

256
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,530
Have you chosen people yet?

257
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,120
If you haven't chosen anyone yet,
can I go?

258
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,780
Can I go?

259
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,350
Please let me compete.

260
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,500
You, I really want to compete.

261
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,550
Hey!

262
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,600
Dean.

263
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm sorry.

264
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,960
This year, I probably won't send our team
to every match.

265
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,410
I probably have to choose only
the important matches first.

266
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,530
Is it because you have to prepare
to compete with the Red Racing team?

267
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,250
That's right.

268
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,230
The more budget that side spends,

269
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,950
the more we cannot be careless.

270
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,970
Otherwise, we will lose the big championship
and lose Babe's record as well.

271
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,220
Huh.

272
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,560
It's not that I don't see your efforts, Dean.

273
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,080
You are a rising young racer.

274
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,620
I guarantee that

275
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,230
once this matter is resolved,

276
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,970
you're the first person
I'm sending to the racetrack.

277
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,400
Actually, you promised.

278
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,530
Yes!

279
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,120
Thank you very much.
Thank you. I will go to practice first.

280
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,380
Hey, you don't have to practice that much.

281
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,490
Please get some rest.

282
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,110
Racers must know how to take care
of their bodies, you know?

283
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,020
Huh.

284
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,060
What are you looking at?

285
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,390
Look at people who act smart
in front of other people.

286
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,700
In fact, you still haven't found a solution
to the capital problem.

287
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,320
Oh, is it easy to fix?

288
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,420
Huh?

289
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,480
It's easy.

290
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,530
If we can't fight about money,

291
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,580
then just find someone with the same amount
to fight with them instead.

292
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,980
The enemy of my enemy is always my friend.

293
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,990
The enemy of my enemy...

294
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,900
It's true.

295
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,020
You really are the best, kid.

296
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,400
Thank you very much.

297
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,780
Oh, don't you continue watching?

298
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
Is it ok?

299
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,680
Mr. Pete

300
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,030
Mr. Pete

301
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,140
Can I have a moment please?

302
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,150
I'm afraid it won't be possible.

303
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,850
Mr. Pete has to rush to a meeting.

304
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,200
But I've been waiting for 5 hours.

305
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,380
Anyway, it's not possible.

306
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,370
So if you have important business...

307
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,540
I'll follow you. You walk first.

308
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,790
Yes.

309
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,220
I give you 5 minutes.

310
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,220
Yes.

311
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,840
I would like to invite you
to invest in my team.

312
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,920
The amount is equal to what UAC CORP invested
in the Red Racing team.

313
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,280
Your No.1 competitor, Mr.Tony.

314
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,490
He also invested in the Red Racing team.

315
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,230
Are you going to let this opportunity
to expand into the market slip away?

316
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,280
My X-Hunter team has a racer named Pit Babe.

317
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,140
He is a superstar racer
who has won many championships.

318
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,220
I don't think you could find
a better team than this.

319
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,320
Tell me what percentage
of the prize money you want.

320
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,540
Excuse Me,

321
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,150
but I'm afraid

322
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,130
the winning prize

323
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,470
is not worth my investment.

324
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,500
But UAC CORP is now one step ahead.

325
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,860
If you don't act now,

326
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,000
will you let Beyond Group lose forever?

327
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,010
Are you sure Pit Babe

328
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,580
can beat the Red Racing team?

329
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,600
I've never been insecure about Babe.

330
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,350
Babe is the greatest racer
I have ever encountered.

331
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,920
The next news can be called another big wave
in the business world.

332
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,500
That was Beyond Group's jump
into the racing world.

333
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,580
It is considered a solution to the game
where competitors like UAC CORP

334
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,560
recently announced their
investment in the Red Racing team.

335
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,950
By Mr. Pete Peeraphon,
the new executive vice president

336
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,360
has announced that he will be
investing in the X Hunter team.

337
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,290
Keep an eye on what's going on with Mr. Pete.

338
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,820
I want to know what strategy Beyeon's group
will come up with.

339
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,150
Welcome to a new dimension of X Hunter.

340
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,130
From now on, our team doesn't
have to stress about money anymore.

341
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,600
Uncle, don't tell me that our team
has hit the jackpot.

342
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey, of course.

343
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,520
Uncle, it's better to confess
that you made a deal with him.

344
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,350
It's not like we have to take on
any odd jobs besides racing.

345
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,620
Hey!

346
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,770
I told you guys
that Mr. Pete doesn't want anything.

347
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,190
Race to win every match against
the Red Racing team.

348
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,280
And then put his brand
on the car and our outfits.

349
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,400
That's all, let's drink.

350
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,850
Let's drink.

351
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,080
From now on

352
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,760
I will push all of us to compete
in both small and senior races.

353
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,540
Practice to the fullest.

354
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,540
From now on,
let's go win the championship.

355
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,880
Drink for the X Hunter.

356
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,770
Bottom up!

357
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,160
Hey!

358
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,850
Did you get the car from Mr. Tony?

359
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,050
Run quickly?

360
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,520
It's still not very good,

361
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,160
the car still needs a lot of tuning.

362
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't be stressed.

363
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,350
Just this, the X Hunter team's horsepower
can't compete with us.

364
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,910
Did you win easily?

365
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,570
Did you know?

366
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,390
That the people who think like this

367
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,270
are the first to lose.

368
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,860
Right now!

369
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,470
The X Hunter team
has been supported by Beyond Group.

370
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,970
If you're careless like this

371
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,600
you'll really lose.

372
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,030
Hmm.

373
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,620
I think...

374
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,610
Getting a new car is useless.

375
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,480
If it happens that Babe can't drive,

376
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,220
is it over?

377
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,400
Oops!

378
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,460
What's wrong with you?

379
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,100
What does that mean?

380
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,380
What are you thinking about doing?

381
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,570
No, I wasn't thinking of doing anything.

382
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,590
But maybe other people did it, I don't know.

383
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,800
Let's just say you're better off staying still.

384
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,120
You'll come thank me later

385
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,180
Is this ok?

386
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,950
Bye bye friend.

387
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,240
Please come.

388
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,620
Please have a seat.

389
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,720
Make yourself comfortable.

390
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,300
How has it been since you moved to Thailand?

391
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,880
Is everything okay?

392
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,190
Everything is fine.

393
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,230
I have something that I'd like your help.

394
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,030
Winner is about to do something.

395
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,020
with team X Hunter's shoo-in.

396
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,440
I think that's not very good.

397
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,900
So why did you come and tell me?

398
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,320
Babe is a competitor for the opposing team

399
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,030
and it has nothing to do with our team.

400
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,450
Well, you are the team owner.

401
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,480
If we actually win the championship this season,

402
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,920
you don't want to be criticized, right?

403
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,410
(It's better to eat nutritious things.
I stock up on soy milk to make sure you're not hungry.)

404
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,470
It's better to eat nutritious things.

405
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,650
I stock up on soy milk

406
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,530
to make sure you're not hungry.

407
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,920
Just give in a little and act like my father.

408
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,130
Why did you say you would be back
in half an hour?

409
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,940
The file was damaged,

410
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,200
so I had to make a new one for customers.

411
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,980
Why haven't you slept yet?

412
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,050
I was asleep but I smelled it.

413
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,310
Have you ever said that I don't smell?

414
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,130
I mean you don't smell bad.

415
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,670
But your scent smells good.

416
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,400
So you're really going to sleep again?

417
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,750
If I'm going to sleep again, why would you?

418
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,760
Hmm.

419
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,510
I probably won't do anything.

420
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,580
I'm just saying

421
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,920
have a good dream.

422
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
So you want to have good dreams?

423
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,130
If that's the case, hurry up.

424
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,080
I want to have good dreams.

425
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,550
Way.

426
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,190
I've got more evidence.

427
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,590
Let's see it.

428
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,490
Alan,

429
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,680
why is Babe's car strangely slow today?

430
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,510
Did you adjust the speed down?

431
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,880
Huh.

432
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,960
No.

433
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,410
So why?

434
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,320
You truly deserve to be a King.

435
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,200
Don't forget to teach me
some cornering techniques.

436
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,190
I have taught you a lot.

437
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,790
Please learned to memorize some.

438
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,000
And I'm sitting here like this.

439
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,470
Isn't your car heavy?

440
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,470
It's heavy.

441
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,630
It's also very heavy.

442
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,870
Heavy until we can't measure
the speed from Babe's car.

443
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
It's okay.

444
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,600
Next time we will measure the speed.

445
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,180
This round is considered practice.

446
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,050
From now on

447
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,550
Charlie will be on the field with us.

448
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,390
As for his position.

449
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,000
Considered to be Babe's apprentice.

450
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,370
Babe.

451
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,640
I'd like to talk to you.

452
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,430
But I'd like to talk in private.

453
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,530
So, are you going to tell me
what you want to talk about?

454
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,580
Huh.

455
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,910
What's up?

456
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,780
He's tricking you, Babe.

457
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,240
People who say they make Videos Editor,

458
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,920
There was no way he could get
into a luxury car like that.

459
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,710
Is it just a car?

460
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,900
It could be his customer's car.

461
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,110
Then you look at this.

462
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,010
Now, how are you going to defend him?

463
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,830
They followed each other up to the condo

464
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,660
and they looked so close.

465
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,760
Haven't I warned you

466
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,580
to watch out for this guy?

467
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,250
Is it strange?

468
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,100
He came in at the time when UAC CORP
came in as a sponsor for Red Racing.

469
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,960
Like this, if information on our team
is leaked, what will we do?

470
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,220
Don't you know how powerful money is?

471
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,140
You don't have to worry.

472
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,750
Anyway, I can beat it.

473
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,180
This isn't just about winning or losing.

474
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,700
It's about safety.

475
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,160
You know that, right?

476
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,850
They are ready to do anything
to bring you down.

477
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,850
And if it does something crazy
or goes against the rules, what will you do?

478
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,060
Look, I'm not blaming you

479
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,130
that you take this guy for your sex buddy
like everyone in the past.

480
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,920
Because I understand that you rely on him
to relieve stress before the competition.

481
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,370
But what I want to remind you

482
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,760
is the situation between you and him.

483
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,610
That if he is a sex buddy,

484
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,810
don't treat it as anything more than that.

485
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,210
Go back to being the old you.

486
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,400
Have you ever told me

487
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,480
not to tie my life to anyone else?

488
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,540
There is no one who truly loves us.

489
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,510
Everyone who comes
into life is hoping for benefits.

490
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,420
So, do you think Charlie will be different
from other people?

491
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,640
OK, I know.

492
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,230
Let's go.

493
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,090
Am I not doing well?

494
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,480
Or what do you like?

495
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,200
It's not that.

496
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,080
Oh!

497
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,810
So what's the matter?

498
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,060
I'm not the one who let people stalk you.

499
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,390
Someone sent it to me.

500
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,990
Who sent it to you?

501
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,590
The point is, whose car do you get into?

502
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,270
A customer.

503
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,040
Coincidentally, he was passing by that area

504
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,480
so he let me join his car.

505
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,590
Are you sure?

506
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,580
Sure.

507
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,460
I don't know who sent it to you.

508
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,740
But he definitely

509
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,730
wants the two of us to fight.

510
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,820
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

511
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,130
No.

512
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,960
So

513
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,630
let's go take a shower, shall we?

514
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,820
I'll go prepare it for you.

515
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,600
Go back to being the old you.

516
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,900
Have you ever told me

517
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,610
not to tie my life to anyone else?

518
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,880
There is no one who truly loves us.

519
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,430
Everyone who comes
into life is hoping for benefits.

520
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,140
Why did you wake up so early today?

521
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,120
Because the smell of the food woke me up.

522
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,020
Ah!

523
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,400
I'm sorry.

524
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,330
I forgot that you are sensitive to smells.

525
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,560
This dish

526
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,180
is spaghetti with truffle cream sauce and ham.

527
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:18,090
This is Spaghetti Bolognese and Pork Balls.

528
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,770
Which dish do you choose?

529
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,560
Hmm,

530
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,170
it's delicious.

531
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,990
Next time, buy it again.

532
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,880
Have you been awake for a long time?

533
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,240
Did you sleep well last night?

534
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,580
Sleep soundly all night.

535
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,220
So I had the energy
to exercise in the morning.

536
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,990
Edit the video a bit.

537
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,110
And then come prepare breakfast for you.

538
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,320
Today is a holiday.
Do you want to go anywhere?

539
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,870
Today I have an appointment with a customer.

540
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,600
The same customer?

541
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,040
No, it's another person.

542
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,630
My job earns little money.

543
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,220
So I have to work on many things
at the same time.

544
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,450
Do you want me to drive you?

545
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,460
Oh, it's okay.

546
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,420
I'm considerate of you.

547
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,520
You have qualifying tomorrow too.

548
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,470
You should rest.

549
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,940
On the left.

550
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,520
Okay, thank you.

551
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,940
-Thanks.
-Thanks

552
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,450
Oh!

553
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,200
-Bro.
-Haven't seen you for many days.

554
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,850
How are you?

555
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,230
-It's hard.
-Hello.

556
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,670
Hey Babe.

557
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,280
Bring it down a notch.

558
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,370
There's a qualifying round tomorrow.

559
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,130
You'll be drunk.

560
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,720
Acting like my father again.

561
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,290
So Charlie didn't come along?

562
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,350
Forget it!

563
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,170
(Babe, where are you?)

564
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,860
(Babe, what time are you coming home?)

565
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,350
(I'm waiting for you.)

566
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:23,230
(Babe, please answer my phone.)

567
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,240
Babe.

568
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,260
Why are you back so late?

569
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,150
Why such a strong smell of liquor?

570
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,750
Don't you have to be nosy?

571
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,700
But tomorrow there is a qualifying round.

572
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,270
Why did you drink so much?

573
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,570
You're just a sex buddy.

574
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,490
Don't interfere in my life.

575
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,240
When I return, whatever I do is up to me,
do you understand?

576
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,270
Babe, let's talk first.

577
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,120
Let's talk about it first, Babe.

578
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:13,810
Babe.

579
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,120
Babe, listen.

580
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,420
Babe, are you okay?

581
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,640
I'm okay.

582
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,980
What are you doing?

583
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,570
Normally you have to concentrate
before competing.

584
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,160
I just want to help.

585
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,310
Not today.

586
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,100
Babe.

587
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,000
Babe.

588
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,950
Babe.

589
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,970
Hey!

590
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,600
Babe.

591
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,920
Babe.

592
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,840
-Babe.
-You snitch, Mr. Tony is like a child.

593
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,050
Babe Fighting

594
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,290
Babe.

595
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,590
Babe Fighting

596
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,880
This is a picture of the competition day

597
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,330
surrounding the qualifying round.

598
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,910
Mr. Sonic, please explain
to Ringside Racing people

599
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,010
what a qualifying day is.

600
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,820
That is, today if anyone scores well,

601
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,730
then tomorrow the actual competition
will be good as well.

602
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,210
As for the fun and excitement,

603
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,380
it's definitely no different
from the actual race day.

604
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,600
Let's start with the qualifying round.

605
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,990
The lead car is a Pit Babe from the X Hunter.

606
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,670
Followed by Kim and Winner
from the Red Racing Team.

607
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,470
4th place is Way from X Hunter.

608
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,770
Winner and Way chase each other closely.

609
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,940
Kim tried to find an opening
to overtake Pit Babe.

610
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,670
Kim ripped out to his right
but didn't have a chance.

611
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,790
At this time, the ranking has not changed.

612
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,190
Babe is leading.

613
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,340
Here, our babe is leading as usual.

614
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,060
He is the King of the Hallow.

615
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,280
Everyone who comes
into life is hoping for benefits.

616
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,800
Haven't I warned you
to watch out for this guy?

617
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,880
I am Babe's boy.

618
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,010
Kim almost found a way to overtake him.

619
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,160
Pit Babe is still on defense.

620
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,250
No one really loves us.

621
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,380
I'm not bored with you.

622
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,330
Oh my gosh, Pit Babe lost control.

623
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,940
As for Kim from Red Racing,
he is already looking for a way to overtake.

624
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,080
I'm not bored with you. I'll take care
of you until you're bored with me.

625
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,830
Oh, Pit Babe lost control and left the field.

626
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,010
It's not easy anymore.

627
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,960
Now Kim is the leader followed
by Winner and Way.

628
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,680
Kim has overtaken.

629
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,380
Kim has taken the lead.

630
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,710
Pit babe made it back onto the track
and tried to accelerate along.

631
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,920
Pit Babe is in 4th.

632
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,480
Accelerate to overtake Way and climb to 3rd.

633
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,360
He's really evil, overtaking Winner
and chasing after Kim.

634
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,150
Pit Babe squeezes into a curve
but still can't pass.

635
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,080
Entering the final turn,
the pair chased each other.

636
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,420
Kim still defends Pit Babe.

637
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,190
Pit Babe tries to find a way to overtake

638
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,960
But in the end he wasn't in time.

639
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,570
Kim and the Red Racing team rose to No.1.

640
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,120
Followed by Pit Babe from
X Hunter Winner and Way.

641
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,660
Way to drink water first.

642
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,280
It's unbelievable

643
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,960
that Pit Babe

644
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,750
King of the Hallow

645
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,470
will perform below standard.

646
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,820
Have you prepared yourself?

647
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,680
That your era of decline

648
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,520
is coming.

649
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,660
-Babe!
-Babe.

650
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,120
(Next episode)

651
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,390
So, can I compensate
by being the boyfriend instead?

652
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,870
Finally you come home.

653
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,300
Have you forgotten?

654
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,060
That you are Daddy's favorite son.

655
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,760
Didn't I tell you not to use tactics
to hurt other teams?

656
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,240
Can't you do something that's clean?

657
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,680
Be careful, it's more inflamed.
The pain won't go away soon.

658
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,250
It's best to be alone.

659
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,460
Love can't trust anything.

660
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,870
What did I do wrong?

661
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,060
Just when you come into the set

662
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,190
say it clearly like this.

663
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,610
-Yeah.
-Ah! louder.

664
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,600
-Yeah.
-Ah!

665
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,760
(Stand Up for 1 about dancing)

666
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,200
Dance with me.

667
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,110
(The ultimate ghost ship.)

668
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,220
Hey!

669
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,050
(In my heart, there's only Babe)
I apologize on behalf of my bro.

670
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,570
(The real ship is here.)

671
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,130
Tony said would you like a glass
of vegetable juice?

672
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,280
Would you like a glass of bonsai?

673
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,170
I don't want it.
