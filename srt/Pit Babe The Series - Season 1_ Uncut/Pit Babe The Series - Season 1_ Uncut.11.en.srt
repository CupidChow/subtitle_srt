1
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,640
because you don't trust in my skills.
I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.

2
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,480
-Charlie.
-Babe.

3
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,980
If you want to get revenge for Charlie.
Please get up and do something with your life first.

4
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,039
I know how to get through to him.

5
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,870
-What are you doing, Charlie?
-I said I knew nothing.

6
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,410
I build X-Hunter together with you and Alan.

7
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,950
I couldn't hurt my own family.

8
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,160
You were the one who caused Charlie's death, right?

9
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,210
But I have no choice.

10
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,470
-Dean!
-Dean!

11
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,039
You never appreciated me.

12
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,650
Dean, why are you so stupid?

13
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,370
Babe!

14
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,270
Take the drug first.

15
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,020
Are you okay?

16
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,030
Have you already informed the police?

17
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,570
I have sent all the evidence to the police for review.

18
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,840
Soon it would be known if it was the device Dean destroyed Charlie's car.

19
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,070
If so,...

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,280
can you find anything else that connects him with Tony?

21
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,640
There was just a phone number where Dean had called someone.

22
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,620
But it probably didn't specify Tony's identity.

23
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,710
They must have changed their phone number.

24
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,130
How can we defeat him?

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,470
We did our best to catch the spy, but we still can't reach him.

26
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,540
I don't want something like this to happen to our team again.

27
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,340
Uncle, don't be stressed.

28
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,890
It will be over soon, believe me.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,390
Tony wouldn't be able to escape for long.

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Stop drinking.

31
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,730
Drinking won't make the situation better.

32
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,030
Now I don't know what to do next.

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,100
I don't know if what I've always believed in is right.

34
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,350
Everything can change at any time.

35
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,010
One day you may not believe in the same things anymore.

36
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,110
To which I thought, "It's not wrong."

37
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,740
Why did you decide to walk away from Daddy?

38
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Because the truth isn't what I thought.

39
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,420
I had expected to be adopted as someone's child

40
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,900
and experience what is called family.

41
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,750
I hope they will never abandon me like my biological parents.

42
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,180
But everything in the end is a benefit.

43
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,940
I used to feel the same as you.

44
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,560
I know how much Daddy can do to get the benefits he wants.

45
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,110
So I decided to come out in order to go back
and end the vicious cycle that Daddy had created.

46
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,790
So that no child will have to become a victim again.

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,960
Then no one will be used because of love again.

48
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,310
You still have a chance to choose, Way.

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,380
You can choose whatever you want to do.

50
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,860
There is news from insiders

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,720
that soon Mr. Tony, the chairman of the Chen Family Foundation,

52
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,270
will once again hold a charity event to raise funds to help children.

53
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,020
Oh, handsome, rich, and warm like this,

54
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,240
Women on social media have already praised him
as the husband of the nation.

55
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,610
Really cheeky.

56
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,870
Babe.

57
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,900
Feeling better now? Why don't you rest a little longer?

58
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,990
My symptoms are better now. This won't kill me.

59
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,460
I have to send Tony to hell first.

60
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,530
I will die in peace.

61
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,490
But there are some things that still make me confused.

62
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,940
He said he only drilled Charlie's brake lines
but didn't do anything to the gas lines.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If so, it means that the car that had an accident...

64
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
That's right.

65
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,840
This means that both Dean and Tony's guys are involved in this matter.

66
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,300
Babe, whatever you do, I will help you.

67
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,930
Kid, will you join me?

68
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
Yes, I join in too.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,980
But now we have to find evidence to confirm Tony's identity first.

70
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,280
How is Charlie?

71
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,970
We need to hurry up a bit.

72
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,500
The symptoms have improved a lot.

73
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,890
External wounds are not of much concern.

74
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,000
In a few days he might be able to walk.

75
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,070
So where have you been?

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,610
Have you eaten anything yet?

77
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,290
Not yet, Uncle Reval, I can't eat anything.

78
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,940
And will you stay here tonight?

79
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,090
No, I have to stay at Alan's house.

80
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,580
Otherwise they will be suspicious.

81
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,890
Um, okay.

82
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,860
Whatever you do, be careful.

83
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,170
We still can't trust the situation.

84
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,790
So you went to stay at Alan's house?

85
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,780
How are you, brother?

86
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,780
I'm not dead yet.

87
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,549
What is the situation now?

88
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,870
Everything went as planned.

89
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,990
Daddy is mad that you died.

90
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,760
Have Kenta search for new alpha children everywhere.

91
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,150
The X-Hunter team has just discovered that Dean is a spy.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,380
Now everyone has moved to stay at Alan's house.

93
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,710
Both Babe North and Sonic Including Kim.

94
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Oh, really!

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,230
What can they do?

96
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,650
Everyone was devastated by your death.

97
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,090
Especially Babe.

98
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,980
Is Babe very sad?

99
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,370
You died right in front of his eyes, how could he not be sad?

100
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
It would take a while for him to accept it.

101
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,740
I understand that you are just as sad.

102
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,620
But don't forget that the person who proposed this plan was you.

103
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,740
You know how Babe will be.

104
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,550
Your glasses.

105
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,920
With this plan, both Kim and everyone will survive.

106
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,920
But we must try so that nothing goes wrong.

107
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,560
And most importantly,

108
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
this time I have to rely on you.

109
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,450
I'm going to cause Charlie's car to have an accident on the field.

110
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,200
Charlie will get hurt

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,130
until he was unable to race the remaining programs.

112
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,000
It's the only way Daddy can bring him back to this house.

113
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,330
So how can I be sure that it really will be like that?

114
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,710
Or will you let the plans you've made for a long time go to waste?

115
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,830
Just believe me.

116
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,090
Try it once, you won't lose anything.

117
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,470
What kind of person do you see me?

118
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,310
I don't need to do dirty things like that.

119
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,130
Just by cutting the brake fluid line, he probably wouldn't die.

120
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,350
But it's up to you.

121
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,570
I'm just here to give you a choice.

122
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,760
You should be well aware of how much better of a racer than Charlie.

123
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,390
If you think what you are going through is fair.

124
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,550
I probably won't be able to help.

125
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,300
Are you courageous enough to bring justice to yourself?

126
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,790
If I succeed, you must let me race in the Red Racing team.

127
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Are you okay?

128
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,440
It's not okay at all.
You know that this cannot be stopped.

129
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,290
This might be our only chance.

130
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,390
Everything must end.

131
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,200
Winner is still in the lead.
Followed by Charlie from X-Hunter.

132
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,950
Charlie.

133
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,010
You want me to lie to that kid's friend that he's dead?

134
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,730
I beg you, Pop.

135
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,350
If you told everyone that Charlie survived.

136
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,220
And in the end,

137
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,530
that kid had to go back to being a money-making tool for people like Tony.

138
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,090
You probably know better.

139
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,770
That life has special power for Charlie it was living hell.

140
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,890
I made a mistake once

141
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,480
believing that senses would make everyone's life better.

142
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,560
I had to take a step back
and let go of the most important person in my life.

143
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,560
I had no idea how much danger such power would put him in.

144
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,970
This time, I won't miss it again.

145
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,960
If you take that child for further treatment at home,

146
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,170
wouldn't that power still reside within the child?

147
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,900
I was able to buy the drug was secretly testing.

148
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,810
Drugs being tested on animals.

149
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,150
Do you think that after injecting then it can stop the senses?

150
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,330
You will need the injection while in the hospital.

151
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,260
Then slowly inject the drug to reduce the pulse.

152
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,410
Until his breath became fainter till he looked like someone who had died.

153
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,870
How do you feel?

154
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
It still hurts when I put weight on it.

155
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,849
Do you want to eat something? I'll make it for you.

156
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,390
No need to, just this is enough.

157
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,630
I think this time I need to add more protein
so my body will be recover quickly.

158
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,810
I couldn't believe that the drug were experimenting would actually work.

159
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Now I don't have any sense left.

160
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,110
So is it good or not?

161
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,430
That's good.

162
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,500
You know that

163
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,600
those senses are like a curse for the two of us.

164
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,120
If you're satisfied, that's good.

165
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:54,640
But we don't know if the potion will completely remove your senses
or just temporarily suppress them.

166
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,100
This makes me a lab rat?

167
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,810
What can I do?

168
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,890
If it weren't for an emergency,

169
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,280
Uncle Reval and I wouldn't be test it with you for the first.

170
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,840
But don't worry.

171
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,870
He'll find a way.

172
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,570
I heard that I'm going to ask people to secretly test drugs

173
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,310
to produce its with more concentrated extracts than before

174
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Jeff.

175
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,110
So how do you know Uncle Reval?

176
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,240
Why I don't know

177
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,720
So why does he have to help us?

178
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,980
In fact, when I first ran away from Daddy's house

179
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,060
It was Uncle Rewal who helped me hide from Daddy's guards.

180
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,580
Uncle also knows how Daddy takes care of us.

181
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,780
And what do you expect from us?

182
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,860
He always taught me not to let Daddy know his true abilities.

183
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,820
Because I will become another beloved child like Babe.

184
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,590
That means it's dangerous for me.

185
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,190
So that means Uncle knew Daddy before?

186
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,670
Don't call it acquaintance,
it's better to call it having grudges against each other.

187
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,740
Uncle has the same goals as us.

188
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,860
I want Daddy to take advantage of no one else's senses.

189
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,720
Uncle probably wanted to protect someone important to him.

190
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,310
Just like you.

191
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,960
So you and I had to be his uncle's lab rats.

192
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
It doesn't matter.

193
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,370
As long as this drug can really get rid of those senses, that's enough.

194
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,230
No matter how many more injections I have to give,

195
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm willing to be a test rat.

196
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,540
At first, I thought that if you didn't dare, I would volunteer.

197
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,370
It can be just temporary or forever.

198
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,960
I just wish I didn't have to see anyone else's future again.

199
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,790
If the drug continues to work for me, it must work for you.

200
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,680
I hope so.

201
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,060
We will finally be happy like normal people.

202
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,240
Where have you been all night? Why haven't you come home?

203
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,100
I didn't go to my own house, I went to my uncle's house.

204
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,800
Well, never mind, where have you gone?

205
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,100
I called and you didn't answer or read your Line.

206
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,700
I just want to be alone and think a bit.

207
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,980
Your house is warm.

208
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,500
But North and Sonic were a bit loud.

209
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
I told you, if you have anything to say, tell me.

210
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,460
Being Alan's boy requires using Alan's boy privileges.

211
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,130
I haven't said yes yet, I'm thinking about it.

212
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,500
Keep doing it and you'll agree.

213
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,100
I have already thought about if I would give this position to anyone.

214
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,400
I never thought of anyone, I only thought of you.

215
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,270
But sometimes,

216
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,120
I may not be the best person for you.

217
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,000
That's not true.

218
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,420
If I say you're the best, it's the best.

219
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,480
Whatever I choose, I don't regret later.

220
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,260
I don't want you to be sad.

221
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,500
So just calm down and think slowly.

222
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,560
Why are kids these days so stubborn?

223
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,060
Asked to be a Boyfriend but never agreed.

224
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Apply some cream.

225
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Do you want me to apply cream?

226
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,290
Apply right here.

227
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,210
How is it?

228
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,120
I'll apply it for you.

229
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,960
Okay, that's okay.

230
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,950
Uncle, you can't just give up.

231
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,310
-Is that right, North?
-Huh.

232
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,390
Even standing and looking from Mars back to Earth, also know

233
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,250
that Jeff also likes Uncle.

234
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,700
Otherwise Jeff wouldn't just be nice to Uncle.

235
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,430
Uncle.

236
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,810
I have a complaint.

237
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,840
Jeff doesn't really care about anyone.

238
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,920
Even when Sonic and I went to talk and play,

239
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,210
he looked at us like air.

240
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,050
That's right.

241
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,810
So I don't know how to act.

242
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,300
And I haven't flirted with anyone in over a year.

243
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,420
And our ages are very different.

244
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,130
As you know, old cows

245
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,950
-are not confident when they have young grass to eat.
-North.

246
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,630
I'm just kidding, Uncle.

247
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Hey!

248
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,220
Well, I've come up with a plan for you.

249
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,070
I want to say this seriously.

250
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Uncle, Uncle just...

251
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,600
called Jeff up to the rooftop.

252
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
And then you...

253
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,320
rappelling from a helicopter.

254
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,990
And you act like this.

255
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,570
To confess your love, right?

256
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,690
Too much.

257
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,110
Uncle just went to put up an announcement on a billboard in the mall.

258
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,460
Dearest Jeff.

259
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,660
Can I be Uncle's boyfriend? Will it work?

260
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
Work!!, yeah.

261
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,500
You two are so useless.

262
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,500
I think you two don't mean well to me.

263
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,650
Uncle!

264
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,920
How can you understand a young man like us?

265
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,770
Jeff isn't a retard like the two of you.

266
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,940
So you go find your own way.

267
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,640
I won't help you, I'm upset.

268
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,680
But for sure you must be decisive.

269
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,610
Because if you confess your love, Jeff must accept his love for you.

270
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,850
Saying I love you is difficult,

271
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,520
but after saying it it's even harder.

272
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,700
Oh, I love this phrase.

273
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,010
Aren't you guys going to eat breakfast?

274
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,810
I'm hungry.

275
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,880
This is our home.
Why has Kim adjusted so quickly?

276
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,430
Is it my house?

277
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,950
By the way, I'm hungry.

278
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,460
Shall we go eat? He'll eat us all up.

279
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Let's go.

280
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,660
Fighting!

281
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,690
You go first.

282
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,390
Uncle!

283
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,670
If you're going to win the heart of a young man,

284
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,670
you have to act like a young man.

285
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,130
Yes, stay young.

286
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,100
Stay young.

287
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,580
You said I'm old?

288
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Come on.

289
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,820
Let's talk about it.

290
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,180
What should I do?

291
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,890
Oh my gosh.

292
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,880
Are you free today?

293
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,960
I have something to talk to you.

294
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,650
I want to do everything to make it clear.

295
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,550
Mr. Pete.

296
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,190
Can we talk?

297
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,210
This matter is probably not convenient to discuss here right now.

298
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,870
You came to meet me here.

299
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,310
Babe goes to see Pete.

300
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,060
They must have planned something.

301
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,840
Do you want me to take down the X-Hunters?

302
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,080
Now the X-Hunters are all in a panic.

303
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,940
They are harmless.

304
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,160
The person we should be careful of is Mr. Pete of the Beyond Group.

305
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,240
Do you want me to arrange something?

306
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,870
You don't have to.

307
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,470
People like Mr. Pete.
You can't do anything to him.

308
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,700
I will handle this myself.

309
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,270
Acknowledged.

310
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,370
Wait, Jeff, wait.

311
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,170
Oh wow.

312
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,240
This way, let's take a break first.

313
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,820
You hold this.

314
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,210
Uncle, come find me here, what's wrong?

315
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,740
You said you had something important to talk to me, right?

316
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,660
So...

317
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,560
you don't care about the answer to Alan's Boy?

318
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Huh.

319
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,090
I don't care anymore.

320
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,020
Even if you reject me a hundred times,

321
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,460
I'll ask you for the 101st time.

322
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,680
I don't want Alan's Boy.

323
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,580
I need you.

324
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,870
I want someone who is stubborn,

325
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,090
tight-lipped.

326
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,540
The person that I said something to, but he wouldn't listen.

327
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,000
A person who never trusts anyone.

328
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,320
Never trust anyone.

329
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,330
But he agreed to be close to me first.

330
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,410
People who like to make me nervous.

331
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,180
You know very well

332
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,690
that you like me too.

333
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,650
Take it.

334
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,220
Don't run away again, okay?

335
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,690
Dating someone as your boyfriend

336
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,110
isn't as scary as you might think.

337
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,260
But I will see the future all about you.

338
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,650
All the secrets you want to hide

339
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,570
you can't hide from me.

340
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,630
And then someday.

341
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,310
From love

342
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,820
it will change to exhaustion.

343
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,950
From someone you love

344
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,260
will become a burden.

345
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,080
I'm pleased

346
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,790
to be the person that no one wants

347
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,460
rather than being a burden on anyone.

348
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,390
I don't care

349
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,880
what you see in my future.

350
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,290
Because of my future,

351
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,980
I can give it to you.

352
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,590
But I'm a problem child,

353
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,790
orphaned and constantly being watched.

354
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,510
And the sense that I can't control .

355
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,480
If you stay with me,

356
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,490
your future will be full of problems.

357
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,410
I may not be able to see it through the eyes of a young man like you.

358
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,750
But all the things you said, kid.

359
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,130
Let me tell you,

360
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,470
I'm not afraid at all.

361
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,550
Don't you want to get to know each other more?

362
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,159
We just kissed each other for the first time.

363
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,320
Leave that matter for another day.

364
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,409
There's still a lot of time left.

365
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,510
I like you.

366
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,920
No, I really love you.

367
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,260
I got it.

368
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,720
But if you stay with me, you have no future.

369
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,450
Leave the matter of the future to the adults to think about.

370
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,960
Still a young man, just thinking about today.

371
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,310
Kid!

372
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,720
Can you cooperate?

373
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,770
How to do it?

374
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,370
You are my first.

375
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
You said it wrong.

376
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,110
I'll be your first and your last.

377
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,390
Pete.

378
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,020
This is Kenta.

379
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,240
From now on, Daddy will let Kenta be Pete's playmate.

380
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Okay.

381
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,250
Have fun playing together.

382
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,500
Kenta, would you like to go play football on the field over there?

383
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,870
He told me I could only stay in the house.

384
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:31,040
Because the outside belongs to the Alpha children.

385
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,710
A friend is a friend, whether it's an Alpha
or a normal person, it's no different.

386
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,590
Daddy ordered you to come play with me.

387
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,870
If Daddy scolds you, I'll help you, okay?

388
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,670
Okay.

389
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,360
What you're about to do will hurt Daddy.

390
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,830
I can't let you do that.

391
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,690
Daddy is such a bad person that you still take sides?

392
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,410
Everything is ready.

393
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,600
Done.

394
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,830
Thank you so much.

395
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,350
It's a pleasure to work with you.

396
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,770
Go, son.

397
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,130
See you later.

398
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:42,970
Yes.

399
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,640
Ken, you are not a bad person.

400
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,190
You don't need to do this.

401
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,930
But I have to do it.

402
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,090
Daddy is the person who gave me life.

403
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,200
He makes people like me valuable.

404
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,150
I can betray anyone,

405
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,740
but I can't betray Daddy.

406
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,770
Then the two of us

407
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,980
would have to separate here.

408
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,570
If you step out of this house,

409
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,030
I will assume that you and I are no longer brothers.

410
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,540
How long have you been looking for evidence against Tony?

411
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,440
What do you know about him?

412
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,650
I have a list of names of children that
the Chen family sold to rich people in many countries.

413
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,020
As much as I could gather.

414
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,180
But it's still hard to convict Tony of human trafficking.

415
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,180
Because we have no evidence that
Tony received any money or anything in return.

416
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,840
in sending children to be adopted by wealthy people

417
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,640
So that means if we have evidence that Tony

418
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,310
received money or things from those millionaires as compensation.

419
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,040
Can we sue him legally?

420
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
We can do it.

421
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,480
But the difficult thing is now I don't know where to get that evidence.

422
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,650
Looks like we've hit a dead end again.

423
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,800
I think we still have a ways to go if we approach the right people.

424
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,540
But you might not like it that much.

425
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,710
Who do you mean?

426
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,450
Way.

427
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,950
If he is Way, I don't take it either.

428
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,800
Way Way.

429
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,830
Way.

430
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
Ah...

431
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,230
Way, now that our bar is closed, let me call you a car service.

432
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,630
No need to, I'll drive back myself.

433
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,160
I don't think you can handle it. I'd better call a car.

434
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,820
Leave your car here until tomorrow, come get it.

435
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,030
If so, I'll call a car service to take you to the same address.

436
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Don't have to.

437
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,220
It's enough to call a service car.

438
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Then okay.

439
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,380
I give you one final warning.

440
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,890
Withdraw yourself.

441
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,170
Don't.

442
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,440
May I sit with you?

443
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,150
Ah!

444
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,270
Well, I'm tired. Whenever I play football with you, I'm always tired.

445
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,310
Next time, I think I'll invite you to a swimming competition.

446
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,390
Let's be honest.

447
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,380
It is better to play badminton.

448
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,660
Interested?

449
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,240
-See you tomorrow.
-Come on!

450
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,470
Who are you really?

451
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,320
And what are these pictures?

452
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,790
Why are you stalking Babe?

453
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,780
I just want to sincerely apologize to you.

454
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,860
Are you done talking?

455
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,720
But I want you to think about it carefully, what is your real goal?

456
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,150
I knew it.

457
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,840
I will never betray you, sir.

458
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,280
If you are truly loyal to me,

459
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,130
Then what you should do is get rid of them.

460
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,150
You're good-for-nothing!

461
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,820
(Fighting scenes buddy.)

462
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,160
Hey, It has to do like this first, again.

463
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,510
Make a sound too.

464
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,890
(Flowy dodging skills.)

465
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,210
Lie down. Lie down.

466
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,000
(Pete couldn't take it anymore.)
If it reaches the neck, then keep still and stare.

467
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,940
Come help me, Jeff.

468
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,520
-Jeff.
-Why you so bad at it, Alan.

469
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,540
(I'm begging.)
Can we play something else, Jeff?

470
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,940
(Don't make noise. He's sleeping.)

471
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,400
Take responsible of me.

472
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,260
(That's my line.)
It's you, thou.

473
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
Crazy!

474
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,470
Strange.

475
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,100
Take responsible of me.
