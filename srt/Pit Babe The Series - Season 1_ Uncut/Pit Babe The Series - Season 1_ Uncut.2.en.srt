1
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,230
My name is Charlie.

2
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,440
I've been a fan of the X-Hunter
and Babe for a long time.

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,130
Please take me under your wing.

4
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,160
Has Babe ever
brought his boys here?

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,450
Of course not, Uncle.

6
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,980
This is first time.

7
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,950
Is he special?

8
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,380
The big news in
the supercar racing world today is

9
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,530
UAC CORP has become the new
sponsor for the Red Racing team.

10
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,640
As you may know,

11
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,729
UAC CORP is currently the No.1
retail business leader in Thailand

12
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,130
UAC Corp is a market leader
in retail and wholesale.

13
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,240
Suddenly, you came to penetrate the racing market like this.

14
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,810
Do you have any surprises?

15
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,190
There's nothing at all.

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,150
I just became interested in the racing industry.

17
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,560
I thought it was a new business opportunity so I wanted to invest.

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,920
It can be called another step in expanding the business.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,880
But there is a trend on social media

20
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,400
that says UAC CORP is trying to launder money.

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,200
Because UAC CORP
has never invested in this field before.

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,210
If you invest like this, will people think you're throwing money away?

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,100
Is that so?

24
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,200
I am the one who has always been interested in racing sports.

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,700
And sees many opportunities for the Thai racing industry to grow.

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,730
Just someone brave enough to invest.

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,320
Push some good racers into the industry.

28
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,540
As you said fully invested,

29
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,530
can you say how much?

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,690
Initially, it wasn't much.

31
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,990
Just 100 million baht.

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,730
But I hope

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,850
that this investment.

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,980
It will create new opportunities.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,710
Maybe the old champion with the same face

36
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,780
will change into a new person.

37
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,630
OK, then please let Mr. James and Mr. Tony shake hands.

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,960
It seems to be serious.

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,440
The underground gambling den have all adjusted their odds now.

40
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,940
Our X-Hunter team and Red Racing

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,600
now have equal odds.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,020
Let it be!

43
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,850
What I'm worried about.

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,090
Are you sure you're okay, Babe?

45
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,370
Of course yes.

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,250
Why are you worried about me?

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,829
Anyway, I won't give up on them.

48
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,050
I'm not worried about whether you lose or not.

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,100
But what I'm worried about...

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,790
We are only worried about Tony.

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,140
That's your Daddy, isn't it?

52
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,510
You should know that Tony's entry into the racing industry

53
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,390
was not intending to penetrate a new market.

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,790
He intends to come to you.

55
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,930
That's right.

56
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,900
Since you ran away from home,

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,329
have you contacted him at all?

58
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,790
I know what you did to my family.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,170
Hey!

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,209
Your duty is to do as I say.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,940
If you refuse to do this,

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,940
I will cancel your scholarship.

63
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,410
Cancel all your expenses.

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,920
Do you think I want to work at your fucking company?

65
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,300
So why would I contact him?

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,870
I was just one of the children he adopted.

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,150
It has no importance in his life at all.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,320
Moreover, if he wants to enter this industry, that's good too.

69
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,790
I will let him know

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,550
that he can't control me.

71
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Okay.

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,750
I believe in you.

73
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,980
Whatever you say, I say so.

74
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,070
I know you're talented.

75
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,720
But you know that if you have any problems,

76
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,150
you can always tell me.

77
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,550
Okay?

78
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,940
Yeah!

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know.

80
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,090
Alan.

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,540
A big thing has happened.

82
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,750
This morning, Tui and Man came to ask to resign.

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,670
It looks like Red Racing has already bought them.

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,390
-Thank you.
-All right.

85
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,280
I think Tony, your foster father,
plays it the hard way.

86
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,390
Not only he spend a lot of money
buying the racers from other teams,

87
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,930
he also threw money
at the technical teams.

88
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,080
If we can’t get maintenance guys
for replacement, we are screwed.

89
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,540
Why did you wake up so early?

90
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,930
I have something to think about.

91
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,700
Go and get dress.

92
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,490
We will go to the garage.

93
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,110
I can’t go there with you today.

94
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,500
I’ve got something to do.

95
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,490
What’s wrong with you?

96
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,420
You told me that
you were free last night,

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,500
I just forgot.

98
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,310
I have a business meeting with clients.

99
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,750
Once I am done,

100
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,110
I will come back to you right away.

101
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,620
Don’t make that kind of face.

102
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,780
Whenever you come black or

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,350
whatever time, it’s your business.

104
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,880
Whether you come back or not,
it’s none of my business,

105
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,070
Really?

106
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,870
I thought you would miss me.

107
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,130
All right. Just come back
In time I will go to bed.

108
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,250
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,090
I will go and hurry back.

110
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,909
They are making a move now,

111
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,880
so we have to act first.

112
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,850
After the announcement of being
partners with Red Racing Team,

113
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,000
our UAC stock rose more than 15%.

114
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,950
Have you sold them yet, Kenta?

115
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,630
I have already sold them.

116
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,770
I put the money into Chen Foundation,

117
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,260
as per your order.

118
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,790
Well done,

119
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,430
James, the Red Racing Team’s owner, wants to have a meeting with you.

120
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,250
Regarding the plan to bring in
more racers to strengthen the team.

121
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,690
I’ve already told him
to make a decision, right?

122
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,460
I’ve told him that too.

123
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,660
But James wants to bring in
foreign racers,

124
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,260
so he want to consult with you and

125
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,810
to know about your opinion.

126
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,360
Here it is.

127
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,660
Tell James that

128
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,480
I found an interesting person already.

129
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,130
Yes.

130
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,070
Yes, Sir.

131
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,870
You have gone all day,

132
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,940
I may have to call and invite you to come back.

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,700
I went out for less than 4 hours, Babe.

134
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,810
Traffic was really bad,

135
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,780
just traveling was already
running out of time.

136
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,850
I might have to make a new rule,

137
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,650
when the employer complain,

138
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,690
the employee who gets 50,000 Baht…

139
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,110
Today, how was the meeting
with your client?

140
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,900
Edited for 100 drafts,

141
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,580
but only 1 draft is picked or what?

142
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,680
Something like that.

143
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,590
You became my boy for a few days,

144
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,560
yet you start to show your true colors.

145
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,570
So, I might have to cancel our agreement.

146
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,790
Babe.

147
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,280
What’s up with you?

148
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,220
Come on. Stop kidding me.

149
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,480
I am not kidding.

150
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,320
Babe.

151
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
Your editing work can get you 40,000 Baht,

152
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,970
my car cost 4 million Baht.

153
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,080
You just think about it.

154
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,230
-Let go off me.
-Babe.

155
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,170
I think you're already menopausal.

156
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,870
Your hormone is swinging,

157
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,510
I will take you to bed.

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,570
Charlie.

159
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,270
When I get up, I will beat you.

160
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,510
Let go off me.

161
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,530
Let go of me Puppy Charlie.

162
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,120
-Let go off me.
-Are you sure,

163
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,050
that you want me to let you go.

164
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,920
How is it going, North?

165
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,550
Oh Come on!

166
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,090
It’s almost done.

167
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,510
-You have to buy me some...
-Hey, you.

168
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,250
I will open an anti-lag function.

169
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,330
-Okay, just do it.
-If this one is empty, you change this one too.

170
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,190
-But if it’s okay, just change the wheel.
-How is the engine RPM setting?

171
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,210
I need 2,000 RPM.

172
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,070
So 1,500 RPM is enough.

173
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,360
Just try it.

174
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,790
Hey, how's it going?

175
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,640
Uncle, we have few repairmen now,

176
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,040
how will our team do next?

177
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,310
Who will tune the engine
when we are in the race?

178
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,110
This is the heart of racers.

179
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,820
You must do something.

180
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,230
I have already advertised in the repairmen group,

181
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,730
you just wait for a while.

182
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,400
Under your advertisement’s post,

183
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,700
the Red Racing Team posted
insulting comments.

184
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,270
I think no one would apply.

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,770
Nueng,

186
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,390
the other repairmans
would not come back, right?

187
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,910
They got triple of their payment,
so no one would come back.

188
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,520
Excuse me.

189
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,090
Are you still look for a repairman?

190
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes.

191
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,480
We do.

192
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,500
Did you come to apply for your friend?

193
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,990
I didn't apply for anyone.

194
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,460
I came to apply for this job.

195
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,700
I filled in my resume as per your post.

196
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,160
You can read it.

197
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,370
Age 20.

198
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,010
Studying in Mechanical Engineering.

199
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,600
You…

200
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,030
You have not graduated yet.

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,990
Even though I haven't graduated yet, I can work.

202
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,390
I can organize my time.

203
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,680
But…

204
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,660
our garage need the experienced
repairman and he must spend time

205
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,970
with our racers.

206
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,740
If you are still studying,

207
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,080
it wouldn’t be convenient.

208
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,250
If you are not sure,

209
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,210
I can be a trainee.

210
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,190
I will do it for free.

211
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
Oh, I am all ears.
Hey, Uncle.

212
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,190
This is for free.

213
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,950
We are short of repairmen now.

214
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,530
Just let him do it.

215
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,090
Yes, Uncle.

216
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,370
Just accept him.

217
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,270
But we can’t let the amateur
tuning our engine.

218
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,710
Skill is most important.

219
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,600
If I can tune the engine of this car
to have more horsepower,

220
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,700
would you accept me to do this job?

221
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,330
Hey, Way.

222
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,720
Did this boy tune the engine alright?

223
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,350
The car is much faster.

224
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,870
Horsepower  is also increased.

225
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,180
Uncle,

226
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,080
Way just broke a record of this car.

227
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,130
Like this. This boy really is…

228
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,130
better than our old
repairmen team.

229
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,440
Hey!

230
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,800
You are a talented one, Boy.

231
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,650
My name is Jeff, not a boy.

232
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,100
Hey, wait up.

233
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,990
I am Alan,

234
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,120
the owner of this garage
and X-Hunter Team.

235
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,610
Anyway, welcome to X-Hunter Family.

236
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,750
I am sorry.

237
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
I have a fear of germs.

238
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,090
I don’t like shaking hand with anyone.

239
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,810
What?

240
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,620
Oh.

241
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,350
All right, nevermind.

242
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,100
Do you want me to start
working today?

243
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
It would be great.

244
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,990
So, you saw it.
We are short of repairmen.

245
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,830
I told you that I will be a trainee,

246
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,560
but if you want me to fill in multiple positions,

247
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,250
you must pay me.

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,210
Don’t worry,

249
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,550
with you skills,

250
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,190
I won’t let you work for free.

251
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,710
Let’s go. We will talk about the salary
and do the agreement that you won’t…

252
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,060
that you

253
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,800
won’t leave and work with another garage.

254
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,850
All right?

255
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,260
Hi, Babe.

256
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,050
I’ve got a new car-tuning repairman.

257
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,640
I guarantee he is skillful.

258
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,730
They are making a move,

259
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,990
we need to take the first action.

260
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,109
You don’t have to be worried,

261
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,349
I have an idea.

262
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,030
What?

263
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,500
Don’t look at me like that.

264
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,150
Way already tested the car.

265
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,530
He gave him a pass.

266
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,910
Is that true?

267
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,900
Alan posted for new repairmen quite some time,

268
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,790
suddenly he just got one.

269
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,370
He looks so young.

270
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,010
No, he is not that young.

271
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,300
He is the same age as your boy, Charlie.

272
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,270
By the way, when you became
my trainee, you were even younger.

273
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,340
All right.

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
If you are okay, I am okay too.

275
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,340
He looks cute by the way.

276
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,620
Please take care of me.

277
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,350
Okay.

278
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,910
You’d better get to know him,

279
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,420
but don’t do that to him.

280
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,230
We have to work together for a long time.

281
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,430
Let’s go.

282
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,580
He is nervous.

283
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,010
Let’s go. I will introduce you to this place.

284
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,500
The mechanic’s room is a sacred place.

285
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,230
Don't take any photo or post.

286
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,250
Understand?

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,500
Go!

288
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,260
I get it.

289
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,140
Hey, Jeff.

290
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,700
If you have something to ask,
you can come to me.

291
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,530
We are like a family here.

292
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,870
Yes.

293
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,470
Do you want me to introduce the team?

294
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,510
Or do you want to look at the whole place?

295
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,410
So, you will know your colleagues.

296
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,880
Hey!

297
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,830
Are you a quiet person?

298
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,100
Yes.

299
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,140
I want to be alone, so I can concentrate.

300
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,250
It's ok.

301
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,770
I will give you a tour.

302
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,940
We kept the cars
that have been fixed overthere.

303
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,480
Way.

304
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
Way. Look at Uncle.

305
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,170
He tries too hard.

306
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,490
this boy puts up the ice-wall so high,

307
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,210
That’s right.

308
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,380
The last time I saw him being like this,
it was when Babe came to our team.

309
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,250
I don’t think
we would have another savage boy.

310
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,060
It’s going to be fun this time.

311
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,450
I think it’s good to have some exciting
 things during this period of time.

312
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,710
Otherwise, we would be very stressed.

313
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,050
There are so many news about
Red Racing Team.

314
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,720
UAC CORP is a real big capital company.

315
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,760
Next season's racing schedule has been released.

316
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,600
I will set the practice schedule for you.

317
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,030
But this year,

318
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,970
we will be more focus on strategy
and tactics than ever.

319
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,750
I need everyone to concentrate.

320
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,410
Oh, wow.

321
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,960
You are so jealous.

322
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,430
You keep staring at him.

323
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,530
What are you talking about, North?

324
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,580
I am not jealous.

325
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,420
So, you are not jealous at all.

326
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,840
Why are you upset with me?

327
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,820
But, come on.

328
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,830
Alan’s boy

329
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,700
are really chatting away with your boy.

330
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,900
When Uncle tried to talk to him,
he merely talked.

331
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,590
He is a charmer.

332
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,870
That’s why he can get Babe.

333
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,850
-North, come on.
-Hey.

334
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,230
-Babe. calm down,
-Calm down.

335
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,370
Sit down.

336
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,850
No need to be a hot head.

337
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,350
Stop now, North.

338
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,450
Babe is very calm, why did you tease him?

339
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,760
-Oh.
-Huh?

340
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,650
You too.

341
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,690
North always teases you like that, right?

342
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,780
Why were you angry today?

343
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,850
I am not angry.

344
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,440
I am just frustrated with many things.

345
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,860
Let’s go this,

346
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,210
if you are so frustrated,

347
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,270
you go out
and drive with me, all right?

348
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,330
Or if you are bored with that Charlie,

349
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,750
I will get you a new one,

350
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,690
like usual.

351
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,790
That’s okay.

352
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,720
I will find that way to release my frustration.

353
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,060
Jeff, what are you doing here?

354
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,620
I applied to be a repairman here.

355
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,520
When you said you had some idea,

356
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,080
it means you came to work here, right?

357
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,910
This was the best way I could think of.

358
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,510
Why didn’t you tell me first?

359
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,460
If I told you, you would stop me.

360
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,320
So, I’d better not tell you.

361
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,470
You already knew, I have to be here

362
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,410
so that I can follow your plan.

363
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,830
Do you have any better ideas than this?

364
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,760
I just don’t want you to be involved with this.

365
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,310
Don’t forget,

366
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,470
your problem is my problem too.

367
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,220
Babe.

368
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
What’s wrong with you?

369
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,290
Is someone making you angry?

370
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,320
How can anyone dare to anger me?

371
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,660
Did you know that new repairman before?

372
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,270
You mean Jeff?

373
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,740
Yes.

374
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,530
I saw you chatted with him.

375
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,900
Did you have so many things to talk with him?

376
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,970
Don’t tell me that you are jealous?

377
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,870
I am jealous of you?

378
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,720
You and North are both crazy.

379
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,880
You and me are not in relationship.

380
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,670
Why would I be jealous of you?

381
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,470
Oh, really?

382
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,970
But from what I saw,

383
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,490
it looks like you get jealous.

384
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,290
I am just angry.

385
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,580
I don't like to do unfavorable trades.

386
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,510
You have a deal with me,

387
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,290
I don't want to overlap with someone else, understand?

388
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,700
Who am I going to do it with?

389
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,610
I only have a deal with you.

390
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,730
Why would I lie to you?

391
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,660
Then what do you two babble about?

392
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,420
It's nothing.

393
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,830
It’s just that We are about the same age.,

394
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,770
so he feels more comfortable talking to me.

395
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,360
Please don't tell this to Alan though,

396
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,050
he’ll feel hurt.

397
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,530
But if you don't like it, then I don't talk to him anymore.

398
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,970
-Okay?
-You better do it.

399
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,500
Stop making expressions like you’re a puppy.

400
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,550
You’ve never been to a gym in your life?

401
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,860
I have.

402
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,010
But I didn't think that people like you
 would come to the gym too.

403
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,220
To be a racer, it's not just about practicing driving,

404
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,240
but the physical fitness must also
be strong enough to control the car, understand?

405
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,740
You have to practice reflexes, ears, eyes, and nose

406
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,070
everything has to be perfect, you know?

407
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,610
Yes, sir.

408
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,210
Today my trainer isn't coming,

409
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,750
so you be my sparring partner.

410
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,260
But don’t go so hard, I have to protect my body.

411
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,150
Go change your clothes.

412
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,830
Again!

413
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,470
Go!

414
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,470
It's Pit Babe.

415
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,810
You met Kim, right?

416
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,290
You probably know him, right?

417
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,390
Kim,

418
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,150
the new racer...

419
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,100
of the Red Racing Team,

420
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,030
Straight from Korea.

421
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,290
Want to fight for a match?

422
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
Oh!

423
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,460
Or don’t you dare to?

424
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,730
Weren't I beaten you enough last time?

425
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,080
So cocky.

426
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,380
So what?

427
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,690
Do you want to go again?

428
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,300
If you can beat Kim,

429
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll pay you double.

430
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,360
But if you can’t,

431
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,630
then I'll take your car.

432
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,630
So what?

433
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,590
Or you don’t dare to?

434
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,290
Huh?

435
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,540
Then I will fight instead.

436
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,760
Charlie.

437
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,130
Fine.

438
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,820
But I’ll consider that your boy

439
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,390
is worth as much as you do.

440
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,110
The odds rate or whatever,

441
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,520
I won't give you a discount.

442
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,270
Why are you fighting instead of me?

443
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,970
You said you have to protect your body, didn't you?

444
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,830
Your body is for racing.

445
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,430
Okay.

446
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,520
But if you lose to him,

447
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,830
I'll hit you worse.

448
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,350
I won't lose.

449
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,810
I'm Babe's boy.

450
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,550
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

451
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,400
-Go.
-Let's go.

452
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,880
-Yes, good punches.
-Nice. Nice.

453
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,960
-That's it.
-Keep going.

454
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,510
-That's it. That's it.
-Come on, get up!

455
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,380
-Unloose him, come on.
-That's it. That's it.

456
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,060
-Get up, come on!
-Keep your guard up!

457
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,580
Keep your guard up!

458
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,620
Your guard!

459
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Hey!

460
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,960
-Come on. Come on!
-Punch him. Punch him.

461
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,800
Hey, lock him tight.

462
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,480
Get up! fight him!

463
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,090
-That's it!
-Like that.

464
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,880
-Are you going to punch him? Right.
-That's it! That's it!

465
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,370
-That's it!
-Come on!

466
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,530
That's it!

467
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,880
Let's go.

468
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,730
Take the lead.

469
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,580
-Take his leg! That's it.
-Come on.

470
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,700
Now!

471
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,890
-Bend the legs out.
-Untangled him.

472
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,660
Bend the legs out, that's it.

473
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,420
Get the legs out!

474
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,830
-That's it.
-Lie down. Lie down. Lie down.

475
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,750
That's it!

476
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,770
Yeah!

477
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,600
-Babe, cheer for him.
-That's it!

478
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,070
-Yeah! Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

479
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,550
Hey,

480
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,450
Don't you forget something?

481
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,470
Do your best.

482
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,820
You're very talented.

483
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,490
Hey!

484
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,300
Are you still in the mood to chill?

485
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,650
Didn't you just lose to Babe's man on stage?

486
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,740
Huh?

487
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,050
So why can't I be in a chill mood?

488
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,920
When I intend to lose.

489
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,470
Today I intend to observe him.

490
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,640
I didn't come to make him observe me.

491
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,300
Unfortunately, I didn't get to compete head-on with Babe.

492
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,930
But we can't underestimate that person,

493
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,220
so you should be careful.

494
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,930
Hey Hey!

495
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,150
What advice are you going to give me? Huh!

496
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,700
The reason that Tony chose you.

497
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,260
That's just because of your popularity.

498
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,560
You may have talent from somewhere else.

499
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,490
But here

500
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,460
I was before.

501
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,120
And you are the one

502
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,100
who must ask for my advice.

503
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,580
Would you like to try it once?

504
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,520
-It hurts.
-You will have no doubts.

505
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,730
Let me go now.

506
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,780
Let me go!

507
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,360
Let me go!

508
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,330
What are you serious about me?

509
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,930
We're on the same team.

510
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,150
Aren't we supposed to work together to attack Babe?

511
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,820
I don't want to cooperate with anyone.

512
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,590
I'm here to be the best in every field.

513
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,780
Is this all just yours?

514
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,110
That's right.

515
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,640
Otherwise, why would I bring you to see?

516
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Because when I'm home, I never see your car.

517
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,080
I have more than 10 cars.

518
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,590
Do you want me to just park it at home?

519
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,070
It's appropriate that I left the car at Way's showroom.

520
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,570
Awesome!

521
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,970
So which car will you drive today?

522
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,910
You've asked the wrong question.

523
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,610
It's not me.

524
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,110
But it's you.

525
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,530
Babe, are you telling the truth?

526
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,890
Yes!

527
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,360
What do you mean?

528
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,580
So you approached me because
you wanted a car to race in, didn't you?

529
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,750
Go ahead!

530
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,810
Whatever car you want, just choose.

531
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,130
Do you really allow me to choose?

532
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,630
You try to choose first.

533
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,050
But I'll tell you whether I agree or not.

534
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,720
Just look at it.

535
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,100
I choose this one.

536
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,590
You got a keen eye

537
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,320
But I think you'd better get a new one.

538
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,220
This is Babe's favorite car.

539
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,700
Because I know that's why I chose this.

540
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,720
Because this car was the first car that Babe drove to the finish line

541
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,470
and also did a very good job.

542
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,980
And he got the alias King of the Hollow

543
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,960
Did you not hear what I said?

544
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,960
For this reason, this car is Babe's favorite.

545
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,610
Besides me being the one taking care of it.

546
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,310
Babe had never let anyone get in this car before.

547
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,130
Then you try to get in the car, Charlie.

548
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,260
Babe, are you serious?

549
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,210
Come on!

550
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,000
If it was anyone else,

551
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,850
they would probably choose a faster, newer car.

552
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,220
But Charlie chose this one,

553
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,450
which shows that he has sharp eyes.

554
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,600
I'll wrap the team stickers for you.

555
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,690
If you take it, then don't disappoint me.

556
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,180
Take it and practice hard.

557
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,930
Did you really give it to me?

558
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,800
Yes!

559
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,040
Thank you very much.

560
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,620
I will do my best.

561
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,620
Charlie, why are you tense? Calm down.

562
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,760
You are skilled, you can do it, do you understand?

563
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,100
You just have to believe in yourself.

564
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,550
-Do you understand?
-Yeah!

565
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm Pit Babe, I am not deciding the wrong people.

566
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,389
Keep driving.

567
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,370
Shift! Shift up.

568
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,659
Slowly climb up, slowly.

569
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,360
Control the car, don't be afraid.

570
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,719
Charlie, don't be afraid.
I told you not to jerk.

571
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:30,000
When you hold the steering wheel,
you have to hold it between 3:00 and 9:00 a.m.

572
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,010
What's this about you?

573
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,600
I'm sorry, Babe.

574
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,300
It's because I'm not good.

575
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,500
There's no need to say that.

576
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,710
I'm just telling you that when you're driving,

577
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,800
estimate the weight of your brakes exactly.

578
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,570
Before you turn, do you understand?

579
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,790
When turning at Apex, brakes, steering, accelerator are all in sync.

580
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,530
Do you get it?

581
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,130
You'll have to practice until you understand how much weight to fit.

582
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,430
I got it.

583
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,050
It is not only the weight of the brakes

584
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,500
but also the braking distance.

585
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,770
It's not just a matter of getting too close or deep.

586
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,110
If we approach too quickly, we will brake too fast.

587
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,420
We will be slower than others.
If we go in too deep, we will fall off the curve.

588
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,080
And when entering a curve, you go along
the Apex and then exit, do you understand?

589
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,670
Why are you staring?

590
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,750
Well, there is nothing.

591
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,280
I just think you're so cool.

592
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,310
-So cool?
-It hurts.

593
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,260
Is it the right time?

594
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,070
What is wrong with you, Charlie?

595
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,630
Well, you look really cool.

596
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,120
You are also the best coach.

597
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,910
Okay, let's drive quickly.

598
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,190
Way!

599
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,590
That's Babe's old car, isn't it?

600
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,980
I remember that Babe didn't have a practice session today.

601
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,010
That's not Babe, that's Charlie.

602
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,910
So Charlie gets to drive Babe's car now?

603
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,280
Yeah!

604
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,380
The skill isn't bad at all.

605
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,620
I doubt Babe really likes him.

606
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,280
Way.

607
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,550
Babe.

608
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,570
Finally you've come.

609
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,760
I thought you were staying with your man.

610
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,730
June, same as before 2 drinks.

611
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,110
How is it going?

612
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,540
Are you jealous of me?

613
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,040
You usually come hang out with me all the time, right?

614
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,520
But now I don't see you often.

615
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,040
Well, here I am.

616
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,620
You're not as old as Aran, why are you so touchy?

617
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,650
Fucking Babe!

618
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,990
Stop it.

619
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,920
I told you many times not to do this.

620
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,200
If one day I like you, what should I do?

621
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,130
If you and I would like each other, we would sparked long ago.

622
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,210
And most importantly, I'm not into love.

623
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,010
I'm satisfied just by chewing Alpha.

624
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,300
Let's have another drink.

625
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,000
So, Charlie didn't come with you?

626
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,810
What is wrong with you?

627
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,020
When he came you complained.

628
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,910
When he didn't come, he asked for him.

629
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,060
I didn't want to ask.

630
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,870
But I want you to look at this.

631
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,070
What is it?

632
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,610
I don't care about the gossip.

633
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,020
But if these gossip news gets leaked,
it will affect our team as well.

634
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,390
Way.

635
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,640
My job is to do my best for the team.

636
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,620
That's it.

637
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,890
By the way, you handle these things for me.

638
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,330
I've managed to clear things up for you.

639
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,740
But you must never forget.

640
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,230
The more skilled and outstanding you are,

641
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,310
the more people will want to take you down.

642
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,760
I know.

643
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,770
Then I'll be more careful from now on.

644
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,090
Next day, just be careful.

645
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,410
If you have anything, you can always call me, you know?

646
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,860
Hey!

647
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,880
You're just my best friend

648
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,870
but you complain like you're my boyfriend.

649
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,470
Bottoms up!

650
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,730
Okay, I'd like two beers, please. Sit in the same place.

651
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,140
Okay.

652
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,170
Oh, Babe.

653
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,400
Babe.

654
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,160
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey!

655
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,030
Sit, I'll go to the bathroom.

656
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,450
Hey, if you get up you'll lose your chair.

657
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,580
-It's up to you.
-If so, you'll lose it.

658
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,050
-Thanks.
-Ooh!

659
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,600
It's good that the two of you came.

660
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,140
Do me a favor?

661
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,310
Want to help?

662
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,010
C’mon, bottoms up.

663
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,370
Bottoms up?

664
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,950
Out of this world!

665
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,550
What's up Mr.Way?

666
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,640
Please keep an eye on Charlie.

667
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,650
-He looked harmless.
-Yeah.

668
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,070
Looks innocent.

669
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,240
Just like a puppy.

670
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,030
So what?

671
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,180
Wait for something to happen first?

672
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,310
I don't know what kind of plan that side will come up with.

673
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,270
But since the Red team was taken over.

674
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,290
It seems like everything has changed.

675
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,630
Even though almost half of our team was bought out.

676
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,160
All right.

677
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,690
I'll take care of it ourselves.

678
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,950
You don't have to worry.

679
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,400
Do the two of you gossip about me?

680
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,370
-No.
-Babe.

681
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,140
C'mon, bottoms up.

682
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,400
You seem extremely suspicious.

683
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,150
Bottoms up!

684
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,170
-No way!
-Do I look suspicious?

685
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,230
-See!
-No no!

686
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,880
-Your eyes were very unnatural.
-Babe.

687
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,460
Bottoms up!

688
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,570
You look strange.

689
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,240
Hey!

690
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,430
Do you think Way is acting like a rabbit awake?

691
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,280
What's a rabbit awake?

692
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,930
We call alarmists.

693
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,980
Yep, that's it.

694
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,600
Hey!

695
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,320
Way seems to

696
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,490
really love Babe.

697
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,650
Well, that's his close friend.

698
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,920
What kind of friend?

699
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,170
Do friends

700
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,570
have to worry about each other that much?

701
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,480
So why should you doubt it?

702
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,710
Way and Babe

703
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,560
have been together for 10 years.

704
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,270
The relationship must be more than friends.

705
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,620
Hey!

706
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,140
You're thinking like me.

707
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,700
This is more than friends.

708
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,240
They definitely like each other.

709
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,680
It's not like that.

710
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,640
More than friends in my opinion.

711
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,120
It means brotherly.

712
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,030
Why? I don't understand.

713
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,550
If they're more than friends,

714
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,640
they must be lovers.

715
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,280
Not like a brother at all.

716
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,090
It's like you and me.

717
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,300
If we were closer than this,

718
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,350
would we already be lovers?

719
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,510
I think the example is strange.

720
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,040
You don't have to think that far.

721
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,240
Because I will break up with you from today.

722
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,950
-North!
-Hey!

723
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,100
Bastard.

724
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,500
Hey, why did you hit me?

725
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,440
How is it, Dean?

726
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,440

727
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,270
Uncle.

728
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,140
Are you ready? I let Jeff tune your machine again.

729
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,920
Guarantee that you can run quickly.

730
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,750
Hey, show him some horsepower.

731
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,100
Oh, hey boy, Jeff!

732
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,910
What are you guys laughing at?

733
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,400
Go get ready!

734
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,570
These guys!

735
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,600
I forgot to tell you.

736
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,680
From now on, people who are
unauthorized to the X-Hunter Team

737
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,530
are prohibited from entering
the garage and training field.

738
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,460
Well, but I came with Babe.

739
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,250
I brought him myself

740
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,880
Uncle didn't say anything.

741
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,650
Why do you have to be serious?

742
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,090
But normally people who aren't
involved are prohibited from entering, right?

743
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,820
Or do you want to make an exception for Charlie?

744
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,750
As a what?

745
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,000
A relative?

746
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,060
A servant?

747
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,440
Or as a boyfriend?

748
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,720
But I forget it.

749
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,290
He's just a sex buddy.

750
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,490
What are you upset about?

751
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,730
Alright, let's go wait outside.

752
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,770
Let's go wait outside.

753
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,700
Okay.

754
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,070
Alan, someone's coming to see you.
He said it was urgent.

755
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,330
-Okay.
-Okay.

756
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,820
Charlie!

757
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,670
What's wrong?

758
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,060
Who are you?

759
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,440
I'm just a sex buddy.

760
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,870
Like you said before.

761
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,960
What can a person like me be?

762
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,440
Don't let me know what you're planning.

763
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,930
Because I'm keeping an eye on you.

764
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,240
You're thinking too much.

765
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,440
Do you have anything else?

766
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,710
if not, I will leave.

767
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,750
what would you come for?

768
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,210
Hello, Alan.

769
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,120
I'm Kenta, representative of Red Racing Team.

770
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,790
If you have any business, say it quickly.

771
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,550
I came to negotiate the purchase of racers from the X-Hunter team.

772
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,570
Our team is not in trouble to the point of
having to release racers to competing teams.

773
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,070
Don't rush to reject me.

774
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,410
Expenses on your own team occur every day.

775
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,490
Would you like to listen to my offer first?

776
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,000
Exchange with Pit Babe.

777
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,990
I think it's not a bad offer.

778
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,610
You go tell your boss.
No matter how much money can buy me

779
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,500
If we can't fight him about money.

780
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,670
We just find someone with as much money as him to fight.

781
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,820
It's true.

782
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,720
You're truly the best, kid.

783
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,380
After this

784
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,500
Charlie will be on the field with us.

785
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,940
As for his position,

786
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,320
it's Babe's apprentice position.

787
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,680
Babe, you said we wouldn't kiss.

788
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,800
(Practise)

789
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,010
(So expert.)

790
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,590
Do your best, this is my car.

791
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,120
I totally ruined it.

792
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,140
Hug him and say "Babe" in cute.

793
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,150
Babe.

794
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,360
(How cute must it be?)
Is this what you call cute?

795
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,420
Let's do it again.

796
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,060
(Playing for real hurts.)
Don't drop your guard.

797
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,590
(Playing for real hurts.)
Don't do it to me.

798
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,390
You see, my finger is jammed.

799
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,910
(IA warrior has wounds)
It's over.
