1
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,860
Welcome to X-Hunter, Charlie.

2
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
From now on, I will prohibit Dean

3
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,539
from going to the garage or practice field for one week.

4
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,080
I don't want you to be a Babe's boy anymore.

5
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,570
Why?

6
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,539
Let's be boyfriend.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,120
When will you stop calling me Kid?

8
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,510
If I don't want to call you Kid,

9
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,870
what do you want me to call?

10
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,000
Darling?

11
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,660
Can I have your necklace?

12
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,250
If there's an amulet from Pit Babe,

13
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,050
then one day

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,970
I might be able to move a little closer to you.

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,930
Way even threw away the necklace I had given him.

16
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,640
Here it is, child.

17
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,120
-Thank you, Auntie.
-Thank you.

18
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,039
Alan, let me ask honestly.

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,440
What's wrong with my relationship with Charlie?

20
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,690
You have to understand him a bit that right now Way is rowdy.

21
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,030
In the past, everything was Way.

22
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,030
Now everything is Charlie.

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,840
People who are close to you like him must naturally feel this way.

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,300
You know that Way and I can only be friends.

25
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,190
Sometimes

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,190
in the past I felt like I didn't dare to love or have a boyfriend.

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,960
Part of it was because Way made me
feel like I wasn't worthy of loving anyone.

28
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,660
He likes to say

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,980
that being alone is the best solution.

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,190
Well, you give him some time.

31
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,590
Oh, Way!

32
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,510
Hey, are you lonely?

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,540
That's why you called me here.

34
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,430
You're all grown up and you're still attached me?

35
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,170
Why are you making a face like that?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,000
I touched Babe and I used my senses on Babe.

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,610
Pictures of the future that occur.

38
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,630
I see something.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,080
Even though I had never seen a picture like this before.

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,530
After you guys are in a relationship.

41
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,790
What do you see?

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,650
The X-Hunter team's car had an accident in the field.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
I think it's Babe's car.

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,900
There were people lying in a pool of blood.

45
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,750
But I don't know who the person lying in the pool of blood is.

46
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,210
Brother.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,329
I think it's becoming more and more dangerous.

48
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,360
You know when I see the future it never fails.

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,890
We withdraw now, it's still time.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,930
We don't need to risk this much.

51
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,210
The closer you are to Babe,

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
the more at risk you guys are.

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,329
That guy

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,329
wouldn't stop.

55
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,630
Brother.

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,660
That person lying in a pool of blood might be you.

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,260
You don't have to say, I can't leave Babe right now.

58
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,030
If I have to take a risk, I will.

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,560
Please give me whiskey like this one.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,010
Today you came alone, didn't you come with a team?

61
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,740
Mr. Pete.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,590
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

63
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,240
The only sponsor of the X-Hunter team.

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,500
I can definitely remember.

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,720
It's just that Alan didn't put your picture in the garage.

66
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,120
You can just call me Pete.

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,040
I'd like one more glass of this for this guy, please.

68
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,660
I treat.

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,320
Two glasses on the rock please.

70
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,340
I don't like to owe anyone anything.

71
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,050
You probably didn't think I was flirting with you, right?

72
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,310
Isn't it like that?

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,010
I just saw you sitting alone.

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,780
So I'd like to come say hello.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,780
Actually, I feel like you're sad.

76
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,440
You might want to talk to someone.

77
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,470
Did I guess correctly?

78
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,330
I said I wasn't going.

79
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,700
Why did you bring me here?

80
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,220
Got home.

81
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,310
I want to keep drinking.

82
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,410
Please, please, bring me some liquor.

83
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,990
Bring some liquor.

84
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,830
Way!

85
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,550
Bring some liquor.

86
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,920
I will drink.

87
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,270
Oh, I still don't want to go home. Why are you bringing me here?

88
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,130
Huh!

89
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,180
Where is Babe?

90
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,470
Why did you bring me home?

91
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,840
Babe.

92
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,180
Babe.

93
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,560
Babe, don't leave me.

94
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,980
Babe, please don't leave me.

95
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,510
(Antianxiety Drugs.)

96
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,740
(If you need a drinking buddy, you can always contact me.)

97
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,990
(If you need a drinking buddy, you can always contact me.)

98
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Give me back my phone.

99
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,040
Are you investigating this?

100
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,230
What do you plan to do?

101
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,710
What I want to do is up to me.

102
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,950
Yes, it's your business.

103
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,950
Don't you know what you're doing?

104
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,490
It has a negative effect on the team.

105
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,270
So, do you know who the person behind Babe's accident is?

106
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,310
I don't know and I don't care.

107
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,330
The only thing I care about

108
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,050
is that Red Racing has to win.

109
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,400
You don't understand me.

110
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,550
How long have I had to put up with Babe?

111
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,260
I've waited a long time for this moment

112
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,770
to throw Babe away.

113
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,680
And Mr. Tony has already paved the way for you like this.

114
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,480
You just stomp him into the ground.

115
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,130
But if you don't want to do it.

116
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,520
I'll do it myself.

117
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,770
And then you go back to Korea.

118
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,060
Don't get in my way.

119
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,460
And if I still see you dealing with these things, it won't have to be Tony.

120
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,950
I'm definitely not keeping you.

121
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,370
Please come, sir.

122
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,270
What did you come here for?

123
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,500
Why are you doing this?

124
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,580
That's too bad, Kenta.

125
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,030
If next time you make a mistake again,

126
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,110
I'm probably going to have to punish you.

127
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm sorry. Next time I'll be more careful.

128
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,510
Does this mean you accept it?

129
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,240
That you guys were the ones who caused Babe's car to have an accident.

130
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,880
Why would you be surprised?

131
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,950
I did everything

132
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,700
to make Red Racing win.

133
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,150
And in that race you also came in 1st place.

134
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,080
Why are you complaining?

135
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,840
I don't want a victory like that.

136
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,500
I'll beat Babe myself.

137
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,450
You still don't know?

138
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,590
Even if you race to the death, you'll never beat Babe.

139
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,740
Your skills aren't even half as good as Babe's.

140
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,750
If you don't believe in me,

141
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,520
then why did you spend millions to get me?

142
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,180
The truth is, I can take anyone to compete with Babe.

143
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,740
It doesn't have to be you.

144
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,450
And the wage I paid you

145
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,570
was considered very cheap.

146
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,370
If compared to the actual value that I will get back.

147
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,660
But you don't have to do this much.

148
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,030
Babe could be dead.

149
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,370
I won't make him die.

150
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,810
Babe is more valuable than you think.

151
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,920
So,

152
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
whatever you're investigating right now,

153
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,170
stop it.

154
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,810
And then you don't have to go back to Red Racing again.

155
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
Our contract

156
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,620
ends now.

157
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,910
You can leave now.

158
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,540
Regarding Babe's price,

159
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,230
have they negotiated at all?

160
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
Not at all.

161
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,930
They are willing to pay if we can deliver on time.

162
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
That's good.

163
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,490
Reply to him that he will definitely get it.

164
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Yes.

165
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,710
I'd like another glass of this, please.

166
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,900
Look at this.

167
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,670
The person who caused your accident on the racetrack

168
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,570
If I were to guess,

169
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,420
you and Tony would have serious problems.

170
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,790
He's going to cut you out of the will, right?

171
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,440
You're so involved in my affairs.

172
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,100
It seemed like you would make a huge profit for him.

173
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,960
What did you know?

174
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,420
He raises children like you to sell.

175
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,440
You are the highest priced person on their list.

176
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,260
And there's another thing that I think you don't know yet.

177
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Please calm down.

178
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,170
Have you met Jeff?

179
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,010
When you were at home, you were closest to him.

180
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,350
I haven't met him at all.

181
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,630
Hello Mr. Suwat.

182
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,130
Hello!

183
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,680
This is my adopted son Charlie.

184
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,250
Hi Charlie.

185
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,820
As for those who can see the future,

186
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,970
I am rushing to find him in time for the auction.

187
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
Okay.

188
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,150
Hopefully, it'll be in time.

189
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,810
Babe.

190
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,859
Charlie.

191
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,160
Babe, how did you get here?

192
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,000
Don't ask me how I got here.

193
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,210
Have you been fooling me all this time?

194
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,070
You are Tony's adopted son.

195
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,780
You are a partisan with him.

196
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,410
Babe, I...

197
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,580
-I can explain.
-That's enough.

198
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,970
What else are you planning to lie to me about?

199
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,720
Do you dare to say that you have never lied to me in the past?

200
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,030
I'm so stupid.

201
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,370
I was so stupid I should have believed what Way told me.

202
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,860
I shouldn't trust anyone.

203
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,030
Get out of my life.

204
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,180
Babe.

205
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,680
What is the matter that brought you here?

206
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,560
I want to drink with you.

207
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,130
Sure.

208
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,890
Oh wow.

209
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,510
Is that enough for tonight?

210
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,010
Won't we get so drunk at all?

211
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,780
Why did you come alone today?

212
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,750
How about your boyfriend?

213
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,850
Let it be!

214
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Way.

215
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,630
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,780
I'm sorry for everything.

217
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,460
I should've believed you from the beginning.

218
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,560
Charlie is exactly as you said.

219
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,970
He's lying to me.

220
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,830
He lies to everyone.

221
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,340
Wait, what did Charlie lie about?

222
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,730
He is another adopted son of Tony.

223
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,220
He has been fooling us all along.

224
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,470
Do you know?

225
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,350
How sorry I am

226
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,450
that I brought people like this in.

227
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,910
You know I've never loved anyone.

228
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,710
I gave everything in my life.

229
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I give it all to him.

230
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,480
It's okay, it's not your fault.

231
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,400
It's my fault.

232
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,010
It's my fault.

233
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,790
It was my fault for making our team like this.

234
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm sorry.

235
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
It's not your fault

236
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,210
Don't cry anymore, I'm right here.

237
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,760
As for the matter of Charlie, you can stop thinking about it.

238
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,740
Tonight, sleep here and return tomorrow morning.

239
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,830
Is this ok?

240
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,410
Oh, Way!

241
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,710
Are you hungry?

242
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,170
Yeah!

243
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,050
Tonight, I'm going home.

244
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,910
So you want me to go with you?

245
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,200
If you go back, won't you meet Charlie?

246
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,520
If I have to meet him, I will meet him.

247
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,940
If I meet him, it's good too, I'll be able to clear things up.

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,510
I don't like the unfinished business.

249
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,680
So you're sure you're okay?

250
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,920
You haven't forgotten that I'm here, right?

251
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,290
I know.

252
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,280
You're so good, how can I forget?

253
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,560
So if I have any problems, I'll come back to you immediately, okay?

254
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,050
Sure.

255
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,940
So let's go have dinner today?

256
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Sure.

257
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,830
Auntie's restaurant, the same restaurant.

258
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,480
Okay, okay.

259
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,410
Consider it a celebration of my singleness.

260
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Babe.

261
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,610
Even if I chase you back several times,
you'll still be bold and back again.

262
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,800
It's appropriate to be partisan with him.

263
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,430
You'd better pack up your things and don't come back here again.

264
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,240
My house doesn't welcome people of that family.

265
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,320
Do you understand?

266
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,690
Babe.

267
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,710
Can you listen first?

268
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,710
Babe, I can explain.

269
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,060
Can you calm down first?

270
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,280
-Can you listen to me first?
-Let me go!

271
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,120
Babe, hey!

272
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,980
Pick up your things too.

273
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,120
Babe, it's not like that.

274
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,290
Didn't you hear me when I said it?

275
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,460
Huh?

276
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,250
Come here.

277
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Babe.

278
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Come here.

279
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,450
You and I broke up, Charlie.

280
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,930
I have neither love

281
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,480
nor benefit for you any longer, do you get it?

282
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,740
But I love you.

283
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,280
Yes, I actually know Tony.

284
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,640
I am actually his adopted son.

285
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,670
But I brought myself in to help you

286
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,700
in order to protect you from his plans.

287
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,310
You had no idea

288
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,670
how much Tony intended to take advantage of your senses.

289
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,810
I know that, I've known it for a long time.

290
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,050
Tony wants to sell me to those millionaires, yes I know.

291
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,300
You know?

292
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,920
I know.

293
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,160
I've been running away for a long time.

294
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,380
All you're doing is buying yourself more time.

295
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,890
You believe me, Tony never thought about letting you go.

296
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,510
You look at this.

297
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,240
Other children at the foundation are raised separately

298
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,390
to practice special skills.

299
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,980
You weren't the only one who was raised like this by Tony.

300
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,400
Orphans that Tony took in to raise from the charity.

301
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
There are many people.

302
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,090
Everyone is Alpha.

303
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,130
Some are elite Alphas with special skills within them.

304
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,000
If trained well, Tony will take care of him like his beloved son.

305
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,940
Didn't you intend to practice your senses like the teacher taught you?

306
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,190
Even though it's really your only advantage.

307
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,060
If you're still stuck like this.

308
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,470
Daddy won't come to see you anymore.

309
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,970
And you will have to stay here alone for the rest of your life.

310
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,650
But if you don't do it well,

311
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,750
your daily life is almost no different from being in solitary confinement.

312
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,410
Charlie, I advise you to find

313
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,450
your special potential as quickly as possible.

314
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,260
We've been wasting more than 2 years now.

315
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,770
I still don't see anything in you.

316
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,800
I will delay sending the report on you to Daddy but it won't be long.

317
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,510
You don't want to get kicked out, do you?

318
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,070
I...

319
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,730
I'll try harder.

320
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,320
I will definitely get better.

321
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,890
I've always wondered why there are so many children in the foundation,

322
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,610
but I hardly see any of them.

323
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,540
These 8 kids

324
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,380
are my group with the most potential.

325
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,400
Their age is still not that old.

326
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,100
I guarantee that if you teach them more,

327
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,680
They will bring more enormous business benefits to us
than anyone can imagine.

328
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,400
Buy it, I guarantee.

329
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,110
You guys won't be disappointed for sure.

330
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,560
And your Chinese millionaire friends

331
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,620
offered any prices yet?

332
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,450
How much will they offer each person?

333
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
-Not everyone voluntarily leaves their home.
-Sure

334
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,220
-They were not adopted willingly elsewhere.
-I sell so cheap.

335
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,070
-But the truth is, everyone is raised like animals.
-I'm willing to sell.

336
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,300
-Everyone is waiting for the day to be resold.
-How much is the cost?

337
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,170
And I was kicked out of the Chen family.

338
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,070
Because I don't have any special sense.

339
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,790
Tony intends to adopt children and then sell them.

340
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,630
Such as people with special potential like you

341
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,130
and me.

342
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,890
You are not an ordinary Alpha, but a special Alpha.

343
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,300
But what is more valuable than you

344
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,190
is the child that is born from you.

345
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Child?

346
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,150
Child is from me?

347
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,420
Tony intends to force you to have a child with Enigma.

348
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,940
The 1% on Earth are more capable than the special Alpha.

349
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,150
And that child born will have a bounty of at least 100 million.

350
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,980
Don't tell Charlie that you first approached me because you were Enigma.

351
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,820
No, I'm a normal Alpha.

352
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,000
I was adopted as well.

353
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,970
But I don't know

354
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,040
who the Enigma that Tony plans to pair you with is.

355
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,780
Charlie actually infiltrates Babe's side

356
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,160
in the X-Hunter garage.

357
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,360
We just ignored it because we didn't think Babe's Boy,

358
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,000
which was only played temporarily, would be a problem.

359
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,940
It's true that I be kind to you.

360
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,400
But I didn't think you'd make this many mistakes.

361
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,150
How could you let Charlie go stay with Babe?

362
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,950
Didn't you say that Charlie has no use for us?

363
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,200
There was no use and he had to leave the mansion.

364
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,340
It was my fault that I didn't work properly.

365
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,750
Will you let me handle it?

366
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Don't have to.

367
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,800
If Charlie plans to get close to Babe,
he must have some kind of plan in mind.

368
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,170
I'll wait and see him a little more.

369
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,870
What exactly does he intend to do?

370
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Kenta.

371
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,270
Yes.

372
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,870
You've really never seen Charlie and Babe together before, have you?

373
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Yes.

374
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,230
You are the person who keeps useless people like me to raise.

375
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,990
I absolutely do not dare to lie to you.

376
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,870
Since I found out Tony was taking you back to the foundation.

377
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,150
I also searched for your information.

378
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,560
Then go to The Hallow field.

379
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,199
I'm trying to make you notice me.

380
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,659
Because I want to know what Tony will do next.

381
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,409
And I hope I can warn you.

382
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,630
What will happen next?

383
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,469
Can I have that glass?

384
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,450
But after I really got to know you.

385
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,950
Learn your talents, strengths,

386
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,380
and weaknesses.

387
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,350
Then I want to be the one beside you

388
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,580
Protect you

389
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,670
from Tony and Enigma who try to get close to you.

390
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,970
But in the end,

391
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,970
it was me who was selfish.

392
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,300
I'm afraid that if you know the truth, you'll hate me like you do today.

393
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,700
Have you told all of your lies?

394
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,020
No, I haven't.

395
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,220
What else are you hiding from me?

396
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,760
I have the same special abilities as you.

397
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm the one who made your senses disappear.

398
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,920
My Sense disappeared because of an accident.

399
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,290
It's not like that.

400
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,090
My special ability is absorption.

401
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,500
The simple explanation is

402
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,610
I took other people's power for myself through touch.

403
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,070
The closer I am to someone,

404
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,870
the more I can steal other people's power as my own.

405
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,780
For now, my wounds have healed

406
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,020
but I still have no sense left

407
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,330
because of you?

408
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,680
I can return it to you.

409
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,850
If I die,

410
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,520
the power I took will automatically return to its owner.

411
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,600
I can die for you.

412
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,150
Don't joke like this, Charlie.

413
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,520
Don't think

414
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,470
that even if I don't have any sense left,

415
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,760
but I'm Pit Babe.

416
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,150
Any special abilities are not necessary.

417
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,130
So, do we think we can reconcile yet, Babe?

418
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,240
Anyway, I won't break up with you.

419
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,770
Can I?

420
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,660
Can Mama not break up with Papa?

421
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,740
Is it time to joke?

422
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,910
Later, if there is anything, you must not hide it from me again.

423
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,570
Do you understand?

424
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,190
Thank you, Babe.

425
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,520
Thank you for forgiving me.

426
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,610
I won't break up with you.

427
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,750
But I invite you to pay for your entire life's karma.

428
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,120
You have to take care of me.

429
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,620
Do you understand?

430
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,670
Of course!

431
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,380
As you wish.

432
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,050
Why are you crying?

433
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,040
I didn't cry.

434
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,180
You've become an arrogant.

435
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,310
Huh!

436
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,300
Oh, dear!

437
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,440
Who will go on a date to Auntie's restaurant?

438
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,270
Over there, they went to a nice restaurant.

439
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,710
No matter how beautiful the restaurant is, it's just not meaningful.

440
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,430
So what will you eat today?

441
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
I'd like the same as before.

442
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Okay.

443
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,720
What's wrong, Babe?

444
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,420
I invite you to come out for a ride and breathe in the fresh air.

445
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,690
Why are you still frowning?

446
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,140
Have you really stopped being angry at me?

447
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,860
I told you I'm not mad at you anymore.

448
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,750
It's just that many things are mixed together.

449
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,380
Does that mean you're still stressed?

450
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,290
That's right.

451
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,870
Why?

452
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,360
May I help you relieve stress?

453
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,090
Are you serious?

454
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,840
Are you sure you can handle it?

455
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,250
It's secretly cramped.

456
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,610
Must try it first.

457
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,930
I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere.

458
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,740
Or are you in a hurry?

459
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,280
If that's the case, I could try all night.

460
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,520
You're just lying there.

461
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,590
I'll do it for you.

462
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,600
Sorry, I just finished clearing things up with Charlie.

463
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,150
I'll tell you later.

464
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,600
Thank you so much for always listening to me.

465
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,330
Are you saying that Charlie and Jeff are also Tony's adopted children?

466
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,560
And they are also people with special abilities like you.

467
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,090
Yes.

468
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,970
And Tony, a wealthy philanthropist
who helps sponsor nearly 50 children one year.

469
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,860
The truth is they are scumbags who run the human trafficking business.

470
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:30,930
I don't know if I couldn't escape from Tony's house back then

471
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,670
and you didn't recruit me,

472
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,860
what my life would be like now.

473
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,520
You can't leave it like this.

474
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,090
Both about you and other children.

475
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,120
Anyway, your fucked-up adoptive father must be in jail.

476
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,880
So what can we do to him?

477
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,340
Even if it were news,

478
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,340
I believe Tony has enough money to silence all the reporters.

479
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,840
If we do anything blindly,

480
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,960
let me tell you, it will be us who are all in trouble.

481
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,680
Alan, did you hear any news about Kim?

482
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,810
He was such an insult to Tony.

483
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,590
Tony wouldn't let him go.

484
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,050
I'm afraid he will be dangerous.

485
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,370
Babe is Tony's adopted son.

486
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,150
Charlie is Tony's adopted son.

487
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,270
And Jeff is also Tony's adopted son.

488
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,370
And how many children does Tony have?

489
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,030
How difficult will it be?

490
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,450
The children in the foundation are all orphans.

491
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,530
All children are considered to be Tony's adopted children.

492
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,830
Oh!

493
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,770
Hey!

494
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,300
Look, if it's like this,

495
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,130
it means Charlie loves Babe very much.

496
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,350
But think about it,

497
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,130
they've never met at the foundation.

498
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,580
But when he found out that Tony was going to harm Babe,

499
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,190
Charlie rushed to help.

500
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,270
I couldn't believe

501
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,830
that someone as generous as Tony would actually do such a thing.

502
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,020
It's like the proverb says

503
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,010
that you can't see your heart by looking at a face.

504
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,540
Know your personality but don't know your nature.

505
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,010
Fucking North.

506
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,630
I lost the game.

507
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,030
Oh, Babe.

508
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,520
The two of you never thought about practicing.

509
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,580
Only paying attention to nonsense.

510
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,780
Babe, what nonsense?

511
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,960
There is no impact on our team at all.

512
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,360
That's right, have you ever heard of

513
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,310
One who knows the enemy and knows?

514
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,040
Have you seen Way?

515
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
I haven't met him.

516
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,110
Last time

517
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,940
I invited him to drink but he didn't answer me.

518
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,800
I don't know how he is now.

519
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,620
Babe, if I didn't know you,

520
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,060
I'd think Way secretly liked you.

521
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,110
You think about it since you dated Charlie.

522
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,120
Way has completely changed, irritated like a person in menopause.

523
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,580
North, shut up.

524
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,340
You talk nonsense.

525
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,100
Way and I are just friends.

526
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,280
If Way contacts you, please tell me.

527
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,330
All right.

528
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,880
What's wrong with him?

529
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,520
Speaking at an inappropriate time

530
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,790
What the fuck?

531
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,000
What did I do wrong?

532
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,350
You still don't know?

533
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,800
Let me go, let me go.

534
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,630
You're so naughty.

535
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,890
I'm giving you a chance to get out of this game.

536
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,260
Why are you still stubborn?

537
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,560
The Thai racing industry isn't for you, Kim.

538
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,020
Shylock like you

539
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,610
should not have a place in this world.

540
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,460
Playing dirty and biting like a dog

541
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,230
You sell people alive.

542
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:35,500
How did you do it and are you still human?

543
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,290
Shut up now.

544
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,330
You did a lot of research about me.

545
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,520
But you still don't know me that well.

546
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,460
Do you know?

547
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,770
I'm not selling just living people.

548
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,630
Dead man...

549
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,670
I also sell.

550
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,310
I just want you to bring him back to me.

551
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,050
I promise I won't do anything to him.

552
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,770
If you're afraid, what can you do?

553
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,720
Now they're targeting us.

554
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,850
No matter how we escape, Tony will attack us anyway.

555
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,030
I don't want to live in a cave like before, and it's all because of you.

556
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,150
Hey, I'm your friend.

557
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,200
And who said I love you like a friend?

558
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,080
But shouldn't you have told me that you had reconciled with Charlie?

559
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,330
Or have you seen that I've been waiting for you all this time?

560
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,680
Do you really want to help him?

561
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
Charlie goes!

562
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,470
If Way contacts you, please tell me.

563
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,700
(I almost get told off.)

564
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,990
(Get told off!)

565
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,270
Cut

566
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,380
(Already reconciled.)

567
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,770
The benefits you want I don't have for you.

568
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,730
(Puppy hurriedly reconciled.)
Cut.

569
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,880
(Crying until exhausted.)

570
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,720
(Someone helped console him.)

571
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,660
(I hope you get better, Pavel.)

572
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,770
Being abused.

573
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
(The face is covered in blood.)

574
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,890
(This scene is prepared to be filmed.)

575
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,760
Not realistic.

576
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,150
(Daddy will help you add makeup.)

577
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
(I've given up.)
