1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Well done!

2
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
Way to drink water first.

3
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,400
It's unbelievable

4
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,550
that Pit Babe

5
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,840
King of the Hallow

6
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,240
will perform below standard.

7
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,460
Have you prepared yourself?

8
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,460
That your era of decline

9
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,600
-is coming.
-Babe!

10
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,000
What the hell is the matter?

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,229
You lost to me anyway.

12
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,080
-Babe!
-Calm down.

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,670
So what if I lose?

14
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,009
But your skill has rusted.

15
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,570
Counting the days until my team knocks you down.

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,580
Calm down, Babe.

17
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,509
We'll go to avenge on the field tomorrow.

18
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,920
Let them know that they can only
make smart-mouthed in qualifying rounds.

19
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,400
Babe!

20
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,140
I think you trust Alan.

21
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,830
People like Winner's all talk!

22
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,780
Hey, Babe!

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,910
Just calm down,
and you can go back to the pits.

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,260
-Hey!
-Babe.

25
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,829
Why are you looking at me?

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,230
You wanna fight?

27
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,460
Why?

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Want to mock me?

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,190
You relate to us in this qualifying round?

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,450
Do you look too down on us?

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,840
I didn't relate to you guys.

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,890
You will definitely see me in the finals.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
So?

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,200
I hope so.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,630
If not,

36
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,340
you would make me lose my determination to win with dignity.

37
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,020
Winner kept barking like a crazy dog.

38
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,440
But I'm not the same.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,510
I moved across the country

40
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,710
to have fun with you.

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,090
If you suck like this.

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,920
I could easily step on you.

43
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,250
It's probably no fun.

44
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,620
You don't have to worry.

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,690
You'll have fun for sure.

46
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,190
Please keep trying, Kim.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,970
Good.

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,630
Hey!

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,230
Ouch!

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,490
Babe!

51
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,800
Get out, I don't want to see your face.

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,400
Get out!

53
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,860
Querify competitions are both won and lost.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,270
But it's only a ranking.

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,020
This isn't even a real race.

56
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,010
After all, no one can replace you in tomorrow's race.

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,160
Tomorrow everyone will see,

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,060
that the hollow has only one King, Pit Babe.

59
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,950
Shall I help you get over your anger?

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,760
What's wrong with you, babe?

61
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,950
You go back to your condo.

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,810
I want to sleep alone.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,250
What did I do wrong?

64
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,560
I don't want to see you.

65
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,140
And you don't have to follow me.

66
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,570
Do you understand?

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,110
Hold on, Babe.

68
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,430
Alan

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,720
hasn't returned home yet?

70
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,010
Wait for them to finish packing and then I'll be back.

71
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,060
Ah!

72
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,200
Is Babe experiencing any stress during this time?

73
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,280
Do you know?

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,680
It would probably be about Charlie, his fanboy.

75
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,220
Charlie?

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,290
I don't know.

77
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,130
I feel displeased with this Babe's fanboy.

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,409
I don't understand why he gave him importance.

79
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,450
I've never seen him take a fanboy's thoughts this seriously.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,820
I doubt Babe really likes this fanboy.

81
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,490
Normally, Babe

82
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,460
doesn't care about his sex buddies.

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,909
If he cares and is like this, it's better to break up.

84
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,250
If they stay together, he loses his job.

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,880
This isn't good for Babe.

86
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
Come on,

87
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,430
you know we can't force him.

88
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,780
Because I know it has to be like this.

89
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,710
During this time, I'd like to ask you to take care of him.

90
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,360
Don't worry, I'll take care of him anyway.

91
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,560
Excuse me, are you Pit Babe?

92
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,520
Did you come alone today?

93
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,450
If I drink alone,

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,210
is it bothering you?

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,780
Not really.

96
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,060
I'm afraid you're lonely.

97
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm your fan.

98
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,990
Watch all your matches.

99
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,670
Would you like a drink? I'll treat you to it.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,740
Oh, that's okay.

101
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,080
But may I sit beside you?

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,630
If you want to sit, please come.

103
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,890
That's smelly!

104
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
You're not my type.

105
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,670
Oh Way!

106
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,760
Sit down.

107
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,490
That's it.

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,140
Even though I'm handsome, I'm still not your type.

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,909
Don't hope for just that look.

110
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,670
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,710
Don't tell me you're looking for sex buddy.

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,470
No,

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,470
I came to you on purpose.

114
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,710
I have something to ask you.

115
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
Is it because of Charlie

116
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,190
that you came 3rd in qualifying?

117
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,050
Why?

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,900
Did you guys fight

119
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,550
or break up?

120
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,090
If you want to talk about this,

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,780
go sit somewhere else.

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,200
I don't want to talk.

123
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,700
Then you should try this.

124
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,510
What?

125
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,640
Are you going to open a hosting bar?

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,020
I'm not investing, I don't have any money.

127
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,310
It's not like that.

128
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,390
This is a list of Alpha that I hand-picked.

129
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,580
There should be someone here

130
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,470
who can touch your heart.

131
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,049
Way!

132
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,740
Why? Don't you like it?

133
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm Pit babe.

134
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,230
I can find myself.

135
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,080
I don't need to use anyone on your list.

136
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,120
So which Pit Babe are you talking about?

137
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,130
The Pit Babe I know

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,800
doesn't let impulse make him sad like this.

139
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,420
Are you sure

140
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,680
you didn't let Charlie influence you too much?

141
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,370
It's best for you to be alone.

142
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Love can't be trusted.

143
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,200
You just go back and do everything as before.

144
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,630
Follow the routine.

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,300
Everything will get better soon.

146
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,770
In the past, when you didn't have him, you were still able to live.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,130
Okay.

148
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,200
Who said I can't live?

149
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,770
I just don't want to have sex with anyone.

150
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,620
When I smell it, I feel sick.

151
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,510
Let's go.

152
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,320
It's better to make you feel better.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,060
Where to go?

154
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,930
Come on, let's go.

155
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,070
Hurry up!

156
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,280
Are you serious?

157
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,390
Yeah, come on.

158
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,160
What are you laughing at? Is it just one red light?

159
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,910
It was you who invited me to compete.

160
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,400
So are you a loser or are you thinking of cheating?

161
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,600
What kind of cheating

162
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,570
is this if counting is only a few seconds apart?

163
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,630
Wow!

164
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,200
Just a few seconds, but losing is losing, Way.

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,510
You go and order Auntie

166
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,050
to take everything as before and 3 beers.

167
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,630
OK, let's sit.

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,950
-Hello Auntie.
-Yes.

169
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,910
Hello Auntie

170
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,870
-Today I ordered everything as usual.
-Okay.

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,290
And 3 bottles of beer.

172
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,340
No matter how many years have passed.

173
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,230
This shop is still the same.

174
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,470
Well, that's true.

175
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,540
Vibe is the same as before.

176
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,370
The food is the same.

177
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,290
You probably remember all the menu page numbers.

178
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,690
But in the past,

179
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,280
how did we drive to eat here?

180
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,410
It's very far.

181
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,980
Because in the past we were not famous.

182
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,740
We are no-name racers.

183
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,780
Are you going to waste Alan's money every day?

184
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
We had to bear our stomachs to eat here.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
Let's be honest.

186
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,760
Here,

187
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,820
it's my 3rd house.

188
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,410
Oh, it's here.

189
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,230
-Thank you.
-Please eat well.

190
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,180
Do you want anything else?

191
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,410
Oh, no, I don't want it anymore. Okay.

192
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,570
If you don't have enough to eat,
the rice pot is inside. Go scoop it yourself.

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,200
Ok, thank you

194
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,690
Yeah.

195
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,530
Hey!

196
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,420
Please share some fried egg.

197
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,350
Fried egg?

198
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,270
So you gave it all to me?

199
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,920
Um, why not?

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,170
It's just a fried egg.

201
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,160
We are friends, that I can give you.

202
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,310
Wow!

203
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,880
Thanks

204
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,870
And if I have a boyfriend,

205
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,740
do I have to share it with you?

206
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,440
Are you crazy?

207
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,060
Talking trash!

208
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,110
So can I make up for it by being your boyfriend instead?

209
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,310
You're as easy to fool as ever.

210
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,560
Why must I be your boyfriend, Babe?

211
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,320
Who is going to be your boyfriend?

212
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,150
You gave it to me.

213
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,350
Hey, the egg yolk is here.

214
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,690
I miss the old days.

215
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,170
We, too, have been through a lot.

216
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,860
Even though thinking makes us like old people.

217
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,270
But I still remember the first day we started practicing.

218
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,210
I was so excited that my legs were shaking.

219
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,040
As you drive far away

220
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,740
before I can catch up.

221
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,000
At that time we had no money

222
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,070
but it was really fun.

223
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,510
Just practice

224
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,470
and go crazy with energy.
I can say that we never get tired.

225
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,460
Our goal at that time

226
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,800
was to win the championship for Alan.

227
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,030
You finally did it.

228
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,890
Pit Babe,

229
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,090
King of the Hallow.

230
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,280
But there was a time

231
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,760
I was afraid of losing so I wanted to run away.

232
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
It's only you

233
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,070
who's always pushing me.

234
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,390
Without you that day,

235
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,780
there wouldn't be Pit Babe today.

236
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,530
But that day, you looked happier than now, Babe.

237
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,340
I don't know what's stressing you out right now.

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,060
But I want you to enjoy racing like before.

239
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,970
No matter what you encounter.

240
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,900
You still have me.

241
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,690
You know, right?

242
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,630
That you could tell me everything.

243
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,820
Yes!

244
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you very much, Way.

245
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,860
Anyway, you will always be my closest friend.

246
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,810
And I hope we stay like that forever.

247
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,840
No matter what happens, I'll be with you.

248
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,440
It really works.

249
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,970
It's not oily anymore.

250
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,040
Babe, have you ever said that your face is oily?

251
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,920
Shall I buy you this serum?

252
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,370
Babe, are you home?

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,920
Have you eaten?

254
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,340
What are you doing?

255
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,810
Can you answer the phone, please?

256
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,480
I think you're unhappy with me.

257
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,369
Babe, if you get home,
please tell me. I'm worried.

258
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,050
Hello, Babe.

259
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,720
Are you waiting for someone's call?

260
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,960
What's up?

261
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,150
Why do you sound disappointed like that?

262
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,170
What's the matter?

263
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,460
Wait.

264
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,290
Why are you being upset with me?

265
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,680
Are you fighting with Babe?

266
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,460
Everyone is asking what the hell is going on between you two.

267
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,940
If I knew, would I sit here and be stressed like this?

268
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,080
I don't know what I did wrong.

269
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,500
Suddenly Babe refused to talk to me.

270
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,170
Then he kicked me out of the house.

271
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,300
Babe kicked you out of the house?

272
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,210
It's a big deal.

273
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,860
So when will you go back?

274
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,280
I don't know if I'll ever go back to Babe's house again.

275
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,750
Is he bored with you?

276
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,910
I do not know.

277
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,170
Charlie,

278
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,880
you can't leave it like this.

279
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,230
It will completely ruin the plan we made.

280
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,320
I'm stressed out.

281
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,050
But don't worry.

282
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,130
I'll find a way to solve the game.

283
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,810
Okay, I won't let him ruin my plan.

284
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,280
Hmm.

285
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
(Babe, have you ever said that your face is oily?)
(Shall I buy you this serum?)

286
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
(Babe, are you home?) (Have you eaten?)
(What are you doing?)

287
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,090
(Can you answer the phone, please?)
(I think you're unhappy with me.)

288
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,290
(Babe, if you get home,
please tell me. I'm worried.)

289
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,090
What the fuck are you driving?

290
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,020
Hey Charlie!

291
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Babe!

292
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Charlie!

293
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
Charlie, watch out.

294
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,100
Hey, stop, what are you doing?

295
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Charlie!

296
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,190
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

297
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,710
-I'm fine but he is.
-Hey, stop it.

298
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,010
Come here, get up.

299
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,470
Are you okay?

300
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,970
Where does it hurt?

301
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,010
Let's go to the hospital.

302
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,990
You hurry to race.

303
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,210
I'm fine.

304
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,970
You won't be able to race in time.

305
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,510
You have to do it for your team.

306
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,260
-Is this okay?
-Okay!

307
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,590
All prepared.

308
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,150
Wey, how's it going?

309
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,400
Why hasn't Babe come yet?

310
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,940
Wait, what happened to your face?

311
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,500
Who stomped on you?

312
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,910
What's happened? Babe, Charlie!

313
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,510
Before coming here, a little incident happened.

314
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,990
Someone came to assault me, luckily Charlie came to help me.

315
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
Hey!

316
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,580
Assault?

317
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,090
So what's wrong with you two?

318
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,570
I'm fine.

319
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,710
But this guy

320
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,170
I told him to go to the hospital and he didn't go.

321
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm not a big deal.

322
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,360
As long as you show up on time, that's enough!

323
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,290
Who does this kind of shit?

324
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,370
It's not difficult to guess who it is.

325
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,010
It must be the team that wants to defeat us the most.

326
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,030
I think it's Red Racing.

327
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,570
I think they wouldn't dare do something like this.

328
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,280
It's probably someone else.

329
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,230
If not them, who would it be?

330
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,590
Who will destroy our team on a competition day like this?

331
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,260
Aren't they?

332
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,300
Red Racing shouldn't do anything to damage their brand.

333
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,820
Moreover, the people who can do these things.

334
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,540
He must have enough power.

335
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,450
Or will it be Tony?

336
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,160
You don't have to worry,

337
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,750
an evil person like him can't do anything to me.

338
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,030
The most he could do was backbite.

339
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,770
I'll prove it to him on the field.

340
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,870
Okay, everyone, go get ready.

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,010
Okay.

342
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,780
The first race day of this season has arrived.

343
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,120
Today the first person at the starting
line-up was Kim from Red Racing Team.

344
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,760
Followed by Pitbabe from Team X-Hunter.

345
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,430
and Winner from the Red Racing team was 3rd.

346
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,490
and Way from the X-Hunter team was 4th.

347
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,610
Today Mr. Tony, President of UAC CORP from the Red Racing team

348
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,410
came to watch as well.

349
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,330
As always, today we come to Ringside Racing with Pit Babe

350
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,240
in the first race of this season.

351
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,240
That's right, but today our Pit Babe isn't the first to come out.

352
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,010
But I'm sure

353
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,130
that my Grandmaster Pitbabe's disciple will definitely win.

354
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,350
Okay, now I'm really excited.

355
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,500
Now it's almost time to start and the race is about to start in...

356
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,600
Five Four Three.

357
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,580
That's good.

358
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,900
Continue following right here.

359
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,750
As I said, Pit Babe wasn't the first to start.

360
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,370
Now the 1st is still Kim.

361
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,320
Let's wait and see if Pitbabe can take the lead.

362
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,500
Starting now, Kim is in 1st place.

363
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,490
Followed by Pit Babe in 2nd place.

364
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,220
Pit Babe tries to find a chance to take the lead over Kim

365
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,130
but still not successful

366
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,570
Passing the curve, Pitbabe tries to chase down Kim.

367
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,200
Now 1st is still Kim followed by Pit Babe.

368
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,780
Then there's Winner and Way, 3rd and 4th.

369
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,230
By doing this, he intends to defeat Babe.

370
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,600
Now the tandem comes up and Pit Babe tried to overtake

371
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,120
But it looks like the Red Racing team

372
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,960
can defend it.

373
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,340
Babe was attacked like this.

374
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,310
Red Racing will win for sure.

375
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,500
There's nothing like that. Our team still has Way.

376
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,310
Way is trying to block Winner.

377
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,270
Now Winner and Way are pushing together.

378
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,010
And Way has already surpassed Winner.

379
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,810
Way is now 3rd, supporting Pit Babe.

380
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,950
Now Pit Babe is accelerating and overtaking Kim.

381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Now Pitbabe is in the lead in 1st place

382
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,860
followed by Kim in 2nd place.

383
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,670
Followed by Way and Winner.

384
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,710
-At this moment, Babe has come.
-Babe is coming.

385
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,330
Very good, Babe.

386
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,620
Pitbabe still leads, followed by Kim.

387
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,770
Pit Babe still leads,

388
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,130
Kim chases him down and looking for a chance to overtake.

389
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,420
Pitbabe can still protect.

390
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,500
Pitbabe is very powerful.

391
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,320
Now onto the final straight of the track.

392
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,320
Kim is still chasing Pitbabe.

393
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,340
He has crossed the finish line.

394
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,220
Pit Babe entered 1st, followed by Kim and Way and Winner.

395
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,530
After your match, you and Charlie go see the doctor.

396
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,540
Go check to see if it hurts anywhere else.

397
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,750
Forget it!

398
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,160
I know myself.

399
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,910
Injured before the race?

400
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,780
Are you still wondering about this?

401
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,260
You probably know who did it.

402
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,560
Who?

403
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,500
And if Babe couldn't come to race?

404
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,740
Who do you think the benefits will go to?

405
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,140
Huh!

406
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,570
Pitbabe

407
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,010
is really cool, you see?

408
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,710
The shot where he was flanked left and right by Team Red.

409
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,080
And then boom.

410
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,000
Win, Awesome

411
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,980
But he clearly intended to flank Babe, see?

412
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,250
Yes, Sonic, I think he wants Babe to hit the side of the road.

413
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,420
-So badass
-Red is tricky like this.

414
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,190
Hey, Babe comes.

415
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,640
We still have to face it in many races.

416
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,090
I think he must have done something dirty again.

417
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,770
We must be careful.

418
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,430
Especially you, Babe.

419
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,180
If your Daddy did it...

420
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,430
I will give him just today as my last day.

421
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,020
Very good.

422
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,520
I told you that the king of the field must be you.

423
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,190
Babe.

424
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,560
I think you should take him to the doctor.

425
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,900
I leave you to take care of him.

426
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
Hey!

427
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,260
I'll take him to see the doctor.

428
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,520
North, Sonic, take him to the doctor.

429
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,000
Yes, yes.

430
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,800
Aren't you short of money?

431
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,300
Just cut the brake fluid line.

432
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,650
There's no problem.

433
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,840
Huh?

434
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,410
You'd rather put him to death.

435
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,860
What are you nosy about?

436
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,360
I've already told you, right?

437
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,680
Don't backbite other racers, especially Babe.

438
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,460
Can't you do something honest?

439
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,740
Why did you send someone to attack Babe before race?

440
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,640
If I win, it's worthless.

441
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,560
It's not me even though I want to hurt him.

442
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,040
But I didn't send anyone to harm him before Race.

443
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,290
Lie!

444
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,500
If it's not you, who will it be?

445
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,090
People who talk like that

446
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,380
have many enemies.

447
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,120
Didn't you think that other people wanted to hurt him?

448
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,900
Take your hands off me.

449
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,570
That's enough.

450
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,170
Let him go.

451
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,860
Finally, you come home.

452
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,850
Have you had enough of lingering?

453
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,320
This is not my home.

454
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,510
And I will never come back here again.

455
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,420
You're still stubborn and haven't changed.

456
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,950
This way of thinking doesn't work.

457
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,080
Born to be human

458
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,210
you must at least repay the gratitude to the people who raised you.

459
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Have you forgotten that you are Daddy's favorite son?

460
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,830
That's enough.

461
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,000
Hey!

462
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,650
I was born as a human being

463
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,480
and should be raised as a human being.

464
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,940
They were not raised like animals.

465
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,660
Whatever he orders, you do everything.

466
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,690
Remember to put it in your skull.

467
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,870
not to mess with me

468
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,880
and guys.

469
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm thinking of the favor that you once had.

470
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,420
Taking on the role of a good adoptive father

471
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,650
Just wait and see,

472
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,590
wait for the day when I will expose your evil deeds.

473
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,790
Including your badness and fake richness.

474
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,250
Don't force me to do that.

475
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,860
Oh, Babe, you're back.

476
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,330
I made a sandwich for you.

477
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,770
Why aren't you at the hospital? Did the doctor tell you to go back?

478
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,520
I'm alright.

479
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,220
Just take the medicine and put the cast on and I'll be better.

480
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,290
This condition is called sick.

481
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,190
And have you had a full body X-ray yet?

482
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,500
Is there any crack somewhere?

483
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,480
There is one place.

484
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,070
Where?

485
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,150
Right here

486
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,070
My heart is all broken

487
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,380
when I see you in danger.

488
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,670
This is not the right time.

489
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,440
You mustn't chase me back to the condo again.

490
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,850
I'm not going back.

491
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,940
No matter how you chase me, I won't go.

492
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,040
Charlie, you have to go back.

493
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,430
I'm not going back.

494
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,870
I'm afraid they'll hurt you again.

495
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,450
It's best for me to be with you.

496
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,860
Please.

497
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,540
That's up to you.

498
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,040
Wherever you want to be, stay. I'm going to bed now.

499
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,860
Ouch!

500
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,250
What happened?

501
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,790
What's wrong?

502
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,130
It's okay.

503
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,490
I probably put a lot of weight on my hand, so it hurts.

504
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,240
So be careful, the more it gets inflamed, the worse it gets.

505
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,690
Why make things difficult?

506
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,960
Just warming it up is delicious.

507
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,620
Because I'm worried about you

508
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,610
I want you to eat a lot of breakfast

509
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,480
and eat food on time.

510
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,270
The Smoked Vienna Sausage I bought

511
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,520
can be cooked in many dishes.

512
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,470
You can request anything you want to eat.

513
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,330
I'm already this old.

514
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,590
I don't need to wait for someone to cook for me.

515
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,680
For now, you should go back to your own condo.

516
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,780
I have races almost every week.

517
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,250
I'm too busy to play.

518
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,610
Why do you say it's up to me?

519
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,750
You said I could be anywhere.

520
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,490
I want to be here.

521
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,120
Besides, I'm a Baby Boy, so I had to take care of you.

522
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,679
The deal we agreed on

523
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,820
was a car for audition practice, right?

524
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,810
OK, I'll call Way.

525
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,070
You can go pick up the car at the garage.

526
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,560
It's end.

527
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,170
Oh, wait a minute, Babe.

528
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,570
End, end of what?

529
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,760
It's us.

530
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,540
It's finally ending.

531
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,810
This would be better for both of us.

532
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,190
That's not good at all.

533
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,310
The car can still be faster than this.

534
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,240
But the horsepower is more than the last race.

535
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,860
Alan tuned it for me again.

536
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,410
Nueng, prepare the car. I'll continue testing it.

537
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,700
Hey, you.

538
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
-Hey, you!
-Let him go.

539
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,300
Stay out of him.

540
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,030
He is in a bad mood.

541
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,480
If you're in a bad mood, why bring it on me?

542
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,250
When did I do anything to him?

543
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,070
Oh, don't be angry.

544
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,610
Small guy!

545
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,710
Why are you acting irritated like an old person?

546
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,290
If Uncle doesn't fix this problem,

547
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,420
I will strike and refuse to work.

548
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,880
Don't worry, I'll fix it for you.

549
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,410
Who would let you be bullied?

550
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,360
You're my favorite mechanic.

551
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,790
Babe

552
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,950
is your favorite.

553
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,630
Oh, you're jealous too.

554
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,990
I'm not jealous.

555
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,020
But Babe is really your favorite.

556
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,710
Everyone must surrender to him.

557
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,710
Babe isn't the favorite.

558
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,510
He is younger brother

559
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,410
Everyone on the X-Hunter team loved him like family.

560
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,560
Just stay for a while and you'll know.

561
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
Hey, kid.

562
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,030
You are an important person for the team.

563
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,930
You're one of my younger brothers too. Try opening your mind.

564
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,530
If you have anything, just come and tell me.

565
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,530
Never mind!

566
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,570
Hey!

567
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,730
See!

568
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,930
Uncle!

569
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,960
I can't train with Babe anymore.

570
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,290
Even if it's just a simulator.

571
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,990
Can you do something?

572
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,430
Seriously.

573
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,450
In the past, he was very serious about racing.

574
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,350
But now multiply by a hundred.

575
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,150
Even though I train hard every day, I still can't train.

576
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,780
Leaving it like this, will it be good?

577
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,210
OK, I'll talk to him.

578
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,060
Are you waiting for Babe?

579
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,780
It's close to a round trend.

580
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,160
So, is it clear or not?

581
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,710
I have something to talk.

582
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,410
I have nothing to talk.

583
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,700
If you don't talk, I'll talk to Charlie in the room. That's fine, right?

584
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,420
You're upset with me about Charlie.

585
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,720
You are misunderstanding

586
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,990
Charlie and I could never have a relationship like that.

587
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,340
You can rely on it.

588
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,850
It just isn't about me.

589
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,490
Why are you telling me?

590
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,760
If it's because of this that you're angry at each other.

591
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,950
I would like to confirm that there is nothing.

592
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,980
Trust me.

593
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,610
I don't want to hear this.

594
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,560
Go away.

595
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,000
Hey, Babe, let's talk first.

596
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,030
I don't understand what I did wrong.

597
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,700
Why did you have to avoid me and break up with me?

598
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,190
I haven't avoided but I'm disgusted.

599
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,260
Disgust? What disgust?

600
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,230
I don't like sharing things with anyone.

601
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,890
What does it mean?

602
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,340
Who do you share things with?

603
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Let me go!

604
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,500
Can you stop lying, Charlie?

605
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,140
You're dealing with me.

606
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,480
But you having a fling with Jeff.

607
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,740
Was it fun to agitate me?

608
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,580
We've gone overboard.

609
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,320
Jeff and I didn't have anything between us that was impossible.

610
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,790
So?

611
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,450
So you answer me.

612
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,320
Why do the two of you like to do something sneaky?

613
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,950
Answer me!

614
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,380
See, you can't answer.

615
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,080
I can't tell you

616
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,540
But I swear it's not what you think.

617
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,730
You think I'll believe you?

618
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,460
I asked if you thought I would believe you.

619
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,850
Nothing is as real as what I saw with my own eyes.

620
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,610
Why are you so stubborn?

621
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm not stubborn, that's enough.

622
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,680
You and I are over.

623
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,160
Get out of my life.

624
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,810
Hold on, Babe.

625
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,390
Wait!

626
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,450
Let's talk first.

627
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,260
Babe Babe!

628
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,020
Babe, can we talk first?

629
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,540
How is it? Did you get anything?

630
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,350
Didn't find anything, found neither history nor photographs.

631
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,330
Mr. Pete may have been abroad for a long time
before returning to manage Beyond Group.

632
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,190
I've given you a long time to find information

633
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,470
but there's nothing for me?

634
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,750
There is one place that Mr. Pete likes to go.

635
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,380
What's up?

636
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,340
We have found the person we have been looking for a long time.

637
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,430
Coming to the second race.

638
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,620
Wow, seeing the X-Hunter team is really amazing.

639
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,770
Since Beyond Group became a sponsor.

640
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,400
It looks like a complete overhaul.

641
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,690
No need to put pressure on yourself, just have fun driving as always.

642
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,710
Skills like driving with eyes closed are still the king of the field.

643
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,680
Do your best.

644
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,580
Don't you want to relieve stress?

645
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,560
If the headache is unbearable, let me call...

646
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
It's okay.

647
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,770
I'll win for sure.

648
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,530
Now all the cars are ready at the starting point.

649
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,120
It's almost time to actually start the race.

650
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,800
Look, Kim and Babe

651
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,240
are very close.

652
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,890
Starting with the first car that was brought up, it's no surprise.

653
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,000
Pitbabe our King.

654
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,970
As for Red Racing, following closely is Winner and Kim.

655
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,740
Whey from X-Hunter is ranked 4th.

656
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,360
Hurry up a little. Way Hurry up a little.

657
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,300
Now Way has successfully overtaken Winner.

658
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,660
Everyone was still competing fiercely.

659
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,030
Now it's still Pit Babe who leads.

660
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:41,850
Babe is still the best-performing racer in the series.

661
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,410
Will he be able to retain his position again?

662
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,780
Kim has overtaken.

663
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,990
Pit Babe has already been overtaken by Kim.

664
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,000
Wait, guys in the racetrack seems to be something strange going on.

665
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,260
Pit Babe's car seems to have some problems.

666
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,070
Alan, what's wrong with Babe's car?

667
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,920
Babe, what happened?

668
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,760
What happened to Babe's car?

669
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,600
I don't know, I'm trying to communicate.

670
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,530
It's okay, Alan, I can handle it.

671
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,110
Uncle, Babe doesn't normally drive like this.

672
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,980
If this is the case, I think the car has a problem.

673
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,410
The team checked the car well.

674
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,740
Before competing, Babe came to check himself again.

675
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,930
After that, no one touched this car.

676
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,550
Oh my gosh, Pit Babe has overtaken Kim once again.

677
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,240
Hey, Babe.

678
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,750
Now it's like Pit Babe loses control of the car.

679
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,150
Now the car started to shake.

680
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,360
Kim rose to 1st place

681
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,230
Followed by Winner and Way.

682
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,650
Pit Babe's car is still parked.

683
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,050
Pit Babe's car has exploded.

684
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,670
And Pit Babe is still stuck in the car.

685
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,830
The other cars return to the pits first.

686
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,200
Field officials were rushing in to help Pit Babe's car.

687
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,280
What did Jeff do with Babe's car?

688
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,580
I'm not. I didn't do anything.

689
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,430
Uncle, I didn't do it.

690
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,070
I must take action from you to the utmost.

691
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,770
Do you care about me?

692
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,690
Pleased to meet you.

693
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,810
Then I'll do the hard work for you.

694
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,680
Has my Sense completely disappeared?

695
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,690
What would you say if I asked to run the rest of the season instead of you?

696
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,220
If Babe can't come to the race.

697
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,530
Which team do you think the benefits will fall on?

698
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,210
(The director hasn't ordered a cut yet.)

699
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,500
(So who cares?)

700
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,510
(Someone secretly laughs.)

701
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,500
(Kim, don't laugh.)

702
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,490
(Being a Pit Babe can get hurt.)
It looks like it's swollen here.

703
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,980
Where is Charlie?

704
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,990
(Tony feels hurt.)
Ungrateful son

705
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,740
Hurting Daddy.

706
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,420
(I love Daddy as always.)

707
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,500
(Got tricked a lot.)

708
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,780
(No energy.)
