1
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,320
You want me to lie to that kid's friends that he's dead?

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,100
I beg you, Pop.

3
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,910
But we don't know

4
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,950
if the potion will completely remove your senses

5
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,590
or just temporarily suppress them.

6
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,330
Pete.

7
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,140
This is Kenta.

8
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,170
I can't let you do that.

9
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,910
Ken, you are not a bad person.

10
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,110
I give you one final warning.

11
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,550
Withdraw yourself.

12
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,800
May I sit with you?

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,470
Ah!

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,419
You push me.

15
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,660
Well, I'm tired. Whenever I play football with you, I'm always tired.

16
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,710
Next time, I think I'll invite you to a swimming competition.

17
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,920
Let's be honest.

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,829
It is better to play badminton.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,190
-Interested?
-Yeah.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on!

21
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh!

22
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,640
Way, don't have to follow him

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,220
Why are you stopping me?

24
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,829
It's not worth it.

25
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,770
He just followed orders.

26
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,100
Why did you stop me from following Kenta?

27
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,510
Even if he has to do as Daddy orders.

28
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,420
But his objective is to kill you.

29
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,720
If I didn't happen to be here, what would you do?

30
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,840
Kenta won't kill me.

31
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,530
Kenta and I

32
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,340
are like real brothers.

33
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,800
We never distrusted each other.

34
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,330
Even if something about Daddy drives us apart.

35
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,940
But I believe he still sees me as a brother.

36
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,860
I wanted to help him get out of that house.

37
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,620
Just like I want to help you.

38
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,570
Pete, you can't help me.

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,280
I can help.

40
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,550
Otherwise you wouldn't have come to see me here.

41
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,800
I just came to see you.

42
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,820
You know now that you want to do everything right.

43
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,370
But you don't know how to beat Daddy, do you?

44
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,620
You used your sense to read my mind?

45
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,080
I don't really want to use it.

46
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,030
But if it's necessary, I must use it.

47
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,740
Otherwise, you will never accept the truth.

48
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,730
Don't let obligation or fear

49
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,590
make you not dare to decide to do the right thing.

50
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,430
You are worth more than Daddy says.

51
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,860
And you always have a choice.

52
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,330
You still have the right to choose, Way.

53
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,740
Ineffectively.

54
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,630
Ineffectively.

55
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,180
Ineffectively.

56
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,540
I told you to go get some special alpha kids.

57
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,930
Is this what you found?

58
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,180
These trash kids are useless.

59
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,650
Why would you choose it for me?

60
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,120
But, if we train these kids well,

61
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,000
they can still develop.

62
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,740
Alpha children are special,

63
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,310
it's something they have since birth.

64
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,690
What are you going to train these rubbish children to do?

65
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,290
Look at yourself.

66
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,310
How many decades have I been training you?

67
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
What efficiency do you get?

68
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,470
In the end, you're still just an ordinary person.

69
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,930
These guys really like to rush me.

70
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,920
Please go check and see if there are any children in our house

71
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,460
who have special senses.

72
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,870
Right now, there are only people who have not yet developed fully.

73
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,770
Because they are still young.

74
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,500
There were only people who used their strength and speed.

75
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,630
But we still have one person left

76
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,570
who have a special sense, much better than those brats.

77
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,330
Who?

78
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,740
Pretending to be old.

79
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,120
I told you to be gentle but you gave it your full strength, Uncle.

80
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,990
Hey!

81
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,040
Hey, just stay still.

82
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Hey you.

83
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,030
i give it to you.

84
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,620
Take it.

85
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,060
It smells so good.

86
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,800
Can I eat it too?

87
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,900
You always have to be sly.

88
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,810
If you want to eat, why don't you make it yourself?

89
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,710
It's delicious.

90
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,140
The more you feed me, the tastier it will be.

91
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,090
Hey Babe!

92
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,740
Do you want to eat fruit?

93
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,160
Or tell me what you want to eat.

94
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,430
I'll cook it for you.

95
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,100
I can eat anything.

96
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,880
Babe!

97
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,510
Fuck North!

98
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,450
What the fuck are you doing?

99
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,600
Why don't you give it to him nicely?

100
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,530
Who would've thought that Babe wouldn't be able to get it?

101
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,090
You know that normally,

102
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,490
whatever I throw, he can catch it.

103
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,620
Damn it!

104
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,900
Babe!

105
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,690
I apologized just a moment ago.

106
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,330
Come on, it's okay.

107
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,580
Babe, do you miss Charlie?

108
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,370
When my senses first disappeared,

109
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,010
Charlie also tested me by throwing fruit like this.

110
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,880
And I can't catch it.

111
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,500
But at that time,

112
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,400
my senses had already moved to Charlie's.

113
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,120
But now Charlie is dead.

114
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,020
And the sense has returned to me.

115
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,470
Why can't I catch it yet?

116
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,200
Maybe your senses have just returned, right, North?

117
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,610
That's right, it's like this, Babe.

118
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,830
I think it's better to go slow.

119
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,190
Don't rush, it'll only get worse.

120
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Okay.

121
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,570
It must be like that.

122
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,020
North, it's because of you.

123
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,370
Babe.

124
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,870
All right!

125
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,280
Are you ready?

126
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,900
Do I have to inject this frequently?

127
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,730
I've tried observing your symptoms.

128
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,510
If you space out the injections,

129
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,250
it seems like your senses will gradually recover.

130
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,850
I think with this injection

131
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,610
every 3 hours.

132
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,250
And I'll quickly find a new drug

133
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,610
that can permanently suppress your senses.

134
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,630
Thank you, sir.

135
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,980
Where are you going?

136
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,570
I'm going to take a walk around here.

137
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,040
Hmm. You'd better not do it yet.

138
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,050
If someone finds you, things will get even bigger.

139
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,280
Just walk around here.

140
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,410
Huh, okay.

141
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,830
Take a walk around the house, don't go too far.

142
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,130
Okay.

143
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,160
Kid.

144
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,980
Where is he going?

145
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,860
Jeff.

146
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,150
Jeff.

147
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,890
Where is he going?

148
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,750
Kid.

149
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,090
What's wrong with him?

150
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,770
Hey, Uncle.

151
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,580
What are you calling us for?

152
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,940
Looking for Jeff.

153
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
Jeff?

154
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,240
-Huh.
-Did he go see someone?

155
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,620
So, is he living with someone or not?

156
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
Look, Uncle, we can follow his phone signal.

157
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,560
Have you ever given him your phone?

158
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,900
Well, what should I do?

159
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,130
Oh!

160
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,360
Deal with it.

161
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,230
Please give me the code.

162
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,910
Better go do it in the car.

163
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,150
Let's go.

164
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,350
-Oh, what a hurry!
-Go, go now.

165
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,640
Go quickly, Kim.

166
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,270
Turn right. Uncle, turn right.

167
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Hey, it's around here.

168
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,060
-I don't see anything around here.
-You park right here.

169
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,109
Yes, yes.

170
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,579
Right here, right here, right here

171
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,230
Is that right?

172
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,930
The GPS says it's here. You can look at it.

173
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,680
-Are you drunk?
-Look, Uncle, look.

174
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,570
Let's see.

175
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,320
Where? I don't see anything.

176
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,550
Where? Let's take a look.

177
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,410
Here.

178
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,920
-Yes, yes.
-Why not ask this gang?

179
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,950
That's it, just ask.

180
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,090
Sir, may I ask you something?

181
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,370
Holy shit, the police are here.

182
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,820
-Wait, don't go yet.
-Hey, hey!

183
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,000
Run away. Run away.

184
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,730
Just come here, come here.

185
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,380
-Let me go.
-Why are you guys running away?

186
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,450
-Let me go.
-GPS follows them.

187
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,550
Hey Kim, go quickly.

188
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,390
Hey!

189
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,040
Hey, please stop.

190
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,830
Kim followed them.

191
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,600
Hey, stop here.

192
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,740
I told you to stop.

193
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm not stopping.

194
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,430
Hey, stop.

195
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,480
Stay still.

196
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,400
-Let me go.
-Why are you guys running away?

197
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,500
-Why did you arrest me?
-Turn around here.

198
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,040
Where is your phone?

199
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,940
No, I don't have a phone, what's the phone?

200
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,860
Honestly, I really don't know.

201
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,430
Is this your phone, Alan?

202
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,210
Come here.

203
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,160
Sit down.

204
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,730
Hey, here's the phone I gave Jeff.

205
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,890
Where will you get it from? Huh.

206
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,440
I really don't know.

207
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,040
The man in the van gave it to me.

208
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm telling the truth.

209
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
Or will Jeff be kidnapped?

210
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,570
Call me, is there any progress?

211
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,990
Like I told you last time

212
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,750
we need someone to have help in our plan.

213
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,540
I already told you.

214
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,820
If it's Wey, I won't join.

215
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,900
I'm sorry, Babe.

216
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,610
Why are you talking now?

217
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,710
Even if you apologize to me a million times.

218
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,370
It can't erase the bad things you did.

219
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,920
But when I came, I didn't want to ask you to forgive me.

220
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,330
I just want to apologize from my heart.

221
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,830
Have you finished speaking?

222
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,910
I really want to help you get rid of Daddy.

223
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,110
Anyone who believes you is a fool.

224
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,560
You've been with him for 10 years.

225
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,670
You suddenly want to change your mind and get rid of him?

226
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,560
Why? Didn't you think of it from the beginning?

227
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,610
In the past I was weak.

228
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm so weak that I don't dare fight with Daddy.

229
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,020
I've always allowed Daddy to trick me.

230
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,950
That if I agree to do everything he tells me, it will be over.

231
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,300
But today I know that I am of no use to him.

232
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,230
If I can't do what he tells me to do.

233
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,870
Including my past actions.

234
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,080
It hurt a lot of innocent people.

235
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,890
Including you,

236
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,650
the person I love the most.

237
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,650
My sense tells me that Way isn't lying.

238
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,130
I understand your feelings very well.

239
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,390
But I want you to think carefully.

240
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,050
What is your true reasons?

241
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,090
If that was Tony's takedown.

242
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,020
This is the only chance we have.

243
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,870
Fine.

244
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,530
But this will be the last time I will work with him.

245
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,130
Now the evidence we have is a clip of Mr. Dong's child's testimony.

246
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,500
and a list of names of children who were sold to other millionaires.

247
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,720
But if Tony is to be prosecuted for human trafficking

248
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,300
The only thing we're missing

249
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,890
is evidence that Tony received compensation.

250
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,730
Those are the evidence.

251
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,250
Even if we search until we die, we won't find it.

252
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,270
Daddy is always careful.

253
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,270
He wouldn't let anyone easily track him down.

254
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,660
Compensation that Daddy received.

255
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,870
Most of them are land or real estate

256
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,710
which was received on behalf of the nominated company called T world.

257
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,330
But if we try to examine it carefully.

258
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,060
None of those assets were used on behalf of the company.

259
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,160
But it was only applied to Daddy's personal matters.

260
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,580
What's wrong with you, Babe?

261
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,290
It's the T-World company.

262
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,480
Tony used it as a nominee

263
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
to cheat my father until he was penniless.

264
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,500
Those documents are at the company.

265
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,480
If we can get those documents out.

266
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,500
Everything is probably connected.

267
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,450
And if combined with the information
that Kim found from the human trafficking warehouse

268
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,940
Let me tell you.

269
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,830
Tony definitely won't survive.

270
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Mr. Tony ordered you not to enter.

271
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,880
And you dare to block me?

272
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,270
I've already told you, right?

273
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,200
That if you are going to escape from this house, you must flee far away.

274
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,910
Otherwise, you'll end up the same way.

275
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,400
What can I do?

276
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,140
Well, Daddy won't stop.

277
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,780
So how can I stop?

278
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,830
But this time I can't help you.

279
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,620
He ran away that way.

280
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,500
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

281
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I know.

282
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,920
Thank you very much.

283
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,560
Last time you agreed to let me go.

284
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,250
I'm just here to warn you.

285
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,880
That this time your Daddy is serious.

286
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,670
If you're thinking of doing something, do it quickly.

287
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,340
Ready to work for me?

288
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,330
I don't agree with you bringing Kenta into our plans.

289
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,690
He's Tony's right-hand man.

290
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,150
What are you thinking, why trust someone like that?

291
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,970
Kenta and I have been friends since childhood.

292
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,370
I believe that deep down he is still a good person.

293
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,180
And one more thing.

294
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,490
If he doesn't want to cooperate with us.

295
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,660
He probably wouldn't accept my appointment like this.

296
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,690
Because he'll trick you.

297
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,950
Don't you know that Kenta would do anything for Tony?

298
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,270
Whether it's something dirty

299
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,160
or a bad thing, he's done it all.

300
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,830
Do you think people like that will easily repent?

301
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,980
But I think people can change.

302
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,520
Even now you still don't believe

303
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,970
that I have repented.

304
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,920
And what if something goes wrong?

305
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,600
What will you do?

306
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,840
We don't know.

307
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,050
We can only try it first.

308
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,250
I know what you guys plan to do.

309
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,910
I'm just coming to tell you.

310
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,540
That I'll never do what you guys want.

311
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,510
Daddy is the person who gave me life.

312
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,920
I will never betray him.

313
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,530
And when will your eyes be open?

314
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,340
And stop acting like a fool and being Daddy's dog.

315
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,070
So you think your life is better than mine?

316
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,880
Have you guys forgotten each other?

317
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,450
That if Daddy hadn't saved your lives.

318
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,240
How will you all be doing now?

319
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,820
Only Daddy

320
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,670
can give you love

321
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,700
and a good life.

322
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,630
In the end, you guys came to repay Daddy like this?

323
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,520
What you said is right.

324
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,600
That we don't have anything better than you.

325
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,490
But I want you to think about the children.

326
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,660
Children living in the house.

327
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,800
Children who don't know anything.

328
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,550
You want those children to grow up.

329
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,300
And then came across things like we encountered?

330
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,110
Live a life that is not your own life.

331
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,390
Deceived, used, tricked into selling.

332
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,770
Being valued as being cheap or expensive.

333
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,130
It's like we're objects.

334
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,030
You can change those stories, Kenta.

335
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,090
You have your own worth.

336
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,520
Without having Tony tell him what to do.

337
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,440
Whoever you want to be in this life, you can be.

338
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,740
You can choose, Kenta.

339
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,910
How was your meeting with them?

340
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,440
I told them to withdraw.

341
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,400
That's it?

342
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,620
Yes, sir.

343
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,800
I thought you had changed your mind and moved to their side.

344
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,660
You are the one who raised me.

345
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,020
I will never betray you.

346
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,660
If you are truly loyal to me,

347
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,640
what you should do is get rid of those people.

348
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,870
It's not like leaving those people floating around like this.

349
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,360
How many times have I ordered you to take them down?

350
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,780
Have you ever done anything?

351
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,210
You can't do it.

352
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,810
I'd like a chance to fix it.

353
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,400
Is that such an opportunity?

354
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,090
You've had that chance your whole life, Kenta.

355
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,340
And the last chance of your life,

356
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,980
I already gave it to you.

357
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,790
But you've disappointed me.

358
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,970
You bite the hand that feeds one.

359
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,910
Please give me a chance.

360
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,430
Even if I have to exchange my life.

361
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,400
I will prove to you

362
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,250
that I will never betray you.

363
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,100
In exchange for your life?

364
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,210
Is your life really that valuable, Kenta?

365
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,790
Don't overestimate your life.

366
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,540
From now on.

367
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,930
You must not step on this floor again.

368
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,790
You have no value to me anymore.

369
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,050
Get over it.

370
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,100
Sir.

371
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,770
Sir,

372
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,140
I'm sorry.

373
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,310
Sorry?

374
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,430
How many times have you apologized to me, Kenta?

375
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,550
How many times?

376
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,100
Huh!

377
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,920
Sir.

378
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
Don't do this.

379
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm begging you, please.

380
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,320
Father.

381
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,910
I'm not your father.

382
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,770
I've never seen you as my son, Kenta.

383
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,200
I raised you like a dog.

384
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,310
Do you still not understand this?

385
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,430
If you choose to be a dog,

386
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,430
then stay downstairs as a guard.

387
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
You, sir.

388
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,140
Go.

389
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,700
Winner.

390
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,860
From now on, you're here to do everything for Kenta.

391
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,950
Yes.

392
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,620
Way, what are you doing?

393
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,660
Daddy let me come get the bag.

394
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,000
But normally,

395
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,580
he had Mr. Kenta bring it himself,

396
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,190
why today it was you?

397
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,510
Send me your bag.

398
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,980
Sleep now.

399
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,320
Hey!

400
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,260
Let's go.

401
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,210
I'm already thinking about it.

402
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,820
Put the bag down.

403
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,630
I told you to put it down.

404
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,290
Please give me a bag.

405
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,200
Please give me some.

406
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,080
Do it quickly.

407
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,210
Hey!

408
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,820
Hey!

409
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,620
No!

410
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,360
Babe.

411
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,909
Hey hey!

412
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,699
Babe gets in the car quickly.

413
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,610
Oh my gosh.

414
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,690
Right here.

415
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,280
Here.

416
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,520
What are you doing without consulting again, Babe?

417
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,070
Things like this probably can't wait, Uncle.

418
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,260
You have to think quickly and act quickly.

419
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,180
You are the same.

420
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,920
Bring a whole bunch of people to look for Jeff like that.

421
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,130
Don't you think you'll tell me at all?

422
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,100
Well, my boyfriend disappeared.

423
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,090
Who can wait?

424
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,660
In conclusion, Jeff's.

425
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,350
Is it because of Tony?

426
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,890
If I were to guess, I'd probably be taken back to that foundation.

427
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,140
But I don't know what Tony's plans are.

428
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,200
Hey, Babe.

429
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,220
So now you've

430
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,740
reconciled with Way?

431
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,410
I don't know.

432
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,720
Think of it as a temporary truce.

433
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,330
I also can't trust him 100%.

434
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,890
But right now

435
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,320
everyone is important to our plans.

436
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,450
And my target is Tony.

437
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,050
I'm going to get revenge for Charlie.

438
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,130
And please help my Jeff back.

439
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,130
A big problem has happened.

440
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,820
Tomorrow night.

441
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,230
Tony is hosting a charity event for the foundation.

442
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
This event was organized only to cover up.

443
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,590
The truth is

444
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,440
that the auction of those children.

445
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,960
Which millionaire will get it?

446
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,640
If we want to help children.

447
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,830
Tomorrow we must not miss this event.

448
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,540
Are we going to just walk into the event?

449
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,110
I've already made a deal with one of Tony's partners.

450
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,400
He will receive an invitation card

451
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,250
and he will take us inside.

452
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,770
Tomorrow's event will have a lot of media.

453
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,390
If we could reveal them.

454
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,790
Tony would just end it.

455
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,700
Hey Alan,

456
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,370
there's one more thing you should know.

457
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,260
My spy told me that

458
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,180
Tony's No.1 product tomorrow night

459
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,580
is a person who can see the future

460
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,410
They came in and stole this.

461
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,890
But I was right there.

462
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,410
So it went against their plan.

463
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,110
I almost caught them.

464
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,940
But only missed a little.

465
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,590
Well, that's lucky for them.

466
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,090
That Babe still has sense.

467
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,500
If not, I'll drag Babe's neck

468
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,920
come back to you.

469
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,030
What did you say just now?

470
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,510
Has Babe's Alpha sense returned?

471
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,350
Well, it should be like that.

472
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,120
I saw that he still looked as agile as ever.

473
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,010
I think

474
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,310
they'll definitely come and disrupt the auction tomorrow.

475
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Shall I order three times the number of bodyguards?

476
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,020
They will not be able to disrupt the auction.

477
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,560
Take this bag and keep it in my room.

478
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,960
Acknowledged.

479
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
Everybody's ready.

480
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,690
Babe, let me ask you something.

481
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,860
Do we have a chance to go back to the way things were before?

482
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,350
What is it like before?

483
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,110
Like I'm still your important person.

484
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,560
There might be one day.

485
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,610
But not soon.

486
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,170
But I can't answer when.

487
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,380
I'm sorry...

488
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,100
for all the past things.

489
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,300
Charlie.

490
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,020
How do you get into this room?

491
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,540
Who exactly are you, uncle?

492
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,980
Are you the same as Tony?

493
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm not on Tony's side.

494
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,480
And they are not anyone's.

495
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,770
So what are these photos?

496
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,970
Why are you stalking Babe?

497
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,980
What do you want?

498
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,080
Why can't I follow?

499
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,520
I just want to know

500
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,430
if my only son

501
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,760
is good or bad.

502
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,730
That's right.

503
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,840
I am Babe's father.

504
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,900
Please give a round of applause to Mr. Tony Chen.

505
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,140
Greetings to all honored guests.

506
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,050
Today our Chen Family Foundation.

507
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,910
Received honor from many artists.

508
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,730
Put their artwork up for auction.

509
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,540
To use the money to help children

510
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,870
with a bird theme.

511
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,020
Invitation to auction of art by children under the care of the family.

512
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,470
Invitation to auction item number 1.

513
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,610
The first auction has begun.

514
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,820
It is a sculpture with a starting price of 1 million baht.

515
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,450
Bid 500,000 per time.

516
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,580
You can start bidding.

517
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,280

518
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,180

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,020

7 Million Baht.

523
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,110
Does anyone want to fight the price again?

524
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,510
Congratulations to Mr. Suwat.

525
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,680
Way and I will go look at the work and see what we can do.

526
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,500
As for you helping me find documents
that were confiscated by Winner that day.

527
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,850
Okay.

528
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,600
We'll catch all those Tonys and the millionaires.

529
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,730
I'm going to help Jeff.

530
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,490
Uncle, how did you get here?

531
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,920
Kid.

532
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,490
Go.

533
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,370
Let's hurry.

534
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,300
They've come in.

535
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,490
2 Million Baht.

536
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,020
3 Million Baht.

537
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,750
3 Million Baht.

538
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:33,920
4 Million Baht.

539
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,730
4 Million Baht.

540
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,580
Does anyone want to fight the price again?

541
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,000
Can't get in.

542
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,920
Let him go.

543
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,670
I would like to join in this merit making as well.

544
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,910
You probably don't mind our entry.

545
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,940
Daddy!

546
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,950
Please come.

547
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,810
(Next episode preview)

548
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,880
(Next episode preview)
Don't you mind saying hello to this Daddy?

549
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,220
Sit down.

550
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,820
Both Alpha, beloved child.

551
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,600
And there are 2 more Enigmas.

552
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,660
I'll let you guys make me money.

553
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,230
Run away quickly.

554
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,350
Wherever he goes, he has to find a focus point.

555
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,190
Uncle.

556
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,050
Uncle.

557
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,020
It's your turn and you go.

558
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,930
P'Nat just poked.

559
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,720
Way doesn't need to follow.

560
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,560
(Prepare for payback!)

561
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,820
(He's satisfied.)

562
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,100
(Nat allows the kids to tease him.)

563
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,300
(Prepare to receive the impact.)

564
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,800
(Put the whole mag in.)
(Combo 3 Hits)

565
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,180
(Is something wrong?)
Cut!

566
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,660
(Is this okay?)

567
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,060
(Reconcile)

568
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,640
(This side is doing slow motion.)

569
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,680
(Pupu's Saber)

570
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
You're angry instead?
