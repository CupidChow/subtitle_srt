1
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,110
We are back again,

2
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,390
The Hallows Super GT Championship.

3
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,930
The Car Racing Program
at the best stadium in Thailand.

4
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,720
- This is our final race for today…
- Live, now.

5
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,400
- …since the qualified round yesterday.
- Easy, easy.

6
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,810
Our favorites are in the front row,
as expected,

7
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,970
Winner from the Red Racing Team.

8
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,789
- And Way from the X-Hunter Team.
- The Hallows with the X-Hunter Team.

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,370
He holds the fabulous record
in this season.

10
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,009
Another favorite

11
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,940
is the one known as
the King Of Racing for many seasons.

12
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,020
Let's see if he can defend his throne today.

13
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,690
Pit Babe from X-Hunter Team.

14
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,840
- All checked, right?
- And this is the racing car.

15
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,220
of King Of the Hallows.

16
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,890
- Okay. Let’s go.
- Pit Babe.

17
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,950
How is it?

18
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,460
I will take you to meet our No.2.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,750
Where is Pit Babe?

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,290
So, you don’t know?

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,070
He makes the concentrating.

22
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,229
Do you know that
Babe is a special Alpha?

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,750
Among 100,000 people
will meet at least one.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,070
All senses of his.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,230
Sight…

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Taste and touch.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,740
Hearing…

28
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,610
or even smelling.

29
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,450
So he has to blow off steam and
relieve it before coming in the race.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,150
Your Alpha’s smell is just…

31
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,400
What smell, Babe?

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,670
You just go back now.

33
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,340
I don’t want to see you anymore.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,010
His advantage
makes him superior to others.

35
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,800
Ready?

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
Helmet.

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,490
Let's start now, Pit Babe's car is in the lead.

38
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,810
Now Pit Babe is in number one.

39
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,350
In this field, Winner is really good.

40
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,120
Pitbabe is really talented.

41
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,050
Hey!

42
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,750
He’s coming. He’s coming now.

43
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,640
He is going to win.

44
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,580
Hey! Hey,Come on.

45
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,550
Way. Awesome!

46
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,990
You are so good, Way.

47
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh! Babe Babe Babe.

48
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,850
Here he is…

49
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,530
This is our King.

50
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,540
นี่คือโฉมหน้าของ
Pit Babe.

51
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,300
Everyone, give it up to Pit Babe.

52
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,140
That was awesome, Pit Babe.

53
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,590
I can't help but be excited.

54
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,100
Although I know that
you would definitely win the race.

55
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,290
- Thanks
- What’s wrong with you?

56
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,570
You look grumpy again.

57
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,320
No! I am fine.

58
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,470
Pit Babe is always the one who wins.

59
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,130
Hey,what’s up with your friend?

60
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,270
What do you think?

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,030
The Alpha he made out with
before the race was not satisfied.

62
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,560
Again?

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,620
How many of them for this month?

64
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,060
Why do you ask?

65
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,900
I've never asked a single question
about how long you've been single.

66
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,430
Come on, Babe.

67
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,480
Hold on.

68
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,270
Don’t mind him. You also know

69
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,530
Babe can't stand
the smell of Alpha for long.

70
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,610
You know it like
you were in that room with me.

71
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,340
If I don’t know you well,
no one in the world would know.

72
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,510
Come on.

73
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,020
We will go celebrate tonight,
will you join us?

74
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,600
You go first,

75
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,180
I’ll take a shower.
That Alpha was so smelly.

76
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,610
- See you later.
- Alright.

77
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,500
Hey! North.

78
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,290
Winner! Winner!

79
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,050
Please help me push the car.

80
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,270
All right, wrap everything.
Keep it tidy.

81
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,409
We’ll go celebrate tonight.

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,130
- My treat.
- Hey, are you sure?

83
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,850
- Really?
- No take backs.

84
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,500
Hey,Babe.

85
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
It’s hurt.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,050
Why are you stalking me?

87
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,360
I am a normal guy.

88
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,790
I am a fan of the X Hunter Team.

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,940
Fan club?

90
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,860
Now a stalker looks this good?

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,659
I am definitely not a stalker.

92
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,560
I just came to watch the Car Racing.

93
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Here!

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,460
It’s true, I came to watch Car Racing.

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,470
So you use the wrong exit.

96
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,020
This is a staff area.

97
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,250
Audiences are not allowed.
Please go.

98
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,830
I didn't come the wrong way.

99
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,820
I came to wait for Babe.

100
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,090
So, you are really a stalker.

101
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,080
I have reason for waiting,

102
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,550
I want to see you all along.

103
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,110
Do I have to remind you

104
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,560
that this is a staff area.

105
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,550
Unauthorized persons
should not come here.

106
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,180
Can I borrow your car?

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,720
I can take any car of yours.

108
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,410
Come on.

109
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,510
I dream of being a race car driver like you.

110
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,310
But I couldn't test-drive with the team.
I didn't have a racing car.

111
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,980
Go rent the car.

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,169
- I am not a saint.
- I have just graduated, I…

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,820
I am jobless,
so I don’t have money to

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,590
rent a good racing car.

115
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,620
I know that
you collect many good racing cars.

116
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,420
- If you can do me a favor…
- Enough.

117
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,230
I don’t get your reason at all.

118
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,830
Why do I have to lend it to you?

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,060
Just get lost.

120
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,690
Otherwise, I will call security
to drag you away.

121
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,270
Understand?

122
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,990
So, you are a stalker,
and also a psychopath?

123
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,460
Get out, I will take a shower.

124
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,050
You can scold me whatever you want,
but I will never let this opportunity slip away.

125
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,090
It’s not easy to see you at all.

126
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,820
I need to borrow your car once.

127
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,970
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll give it my all.

128
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,660
- What is your name?
- I am Charlie.

129
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,570
Are you Alpha?

130
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,960
That’s right.

131
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,620
Are you sure that you won’t
regret that offering to me?

132
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,560
I offer you everything I have
if you really lend me your car.

133
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,990
I will never forget your kindness.

134
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,780
I can be your servant
for the rest of my life.

135
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,890
A servant?

136
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,700
I don’t need one.

137
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,720
I need you.

138
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,720
Babe, what do you mean?

139
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,680
You said you are my fanboy.

140
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,730
Don’t you know about my alias?

141
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,060
If you can satisfy me,

142
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,840
you can pick any car you want.

143
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
But there is a price to pay.

144
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,260
And this offer,

145
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,620
I give you only once.

146
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,470
If okay, go to the next step.

147
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,640
If not, you just get lost
and don’t come back again.

148
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,780
I will do it.

149
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,140
You said okay like this.
Are you sure you know how to do it?

150
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,330
Huh.

151
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,980
This kind of thing…

152
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,790
once I start, I won’t allow you to stop.

153
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,600
If you want to know,
you have to test it yourself.

154
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,450
Test it.

155
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,670
Hey, I can see.

156
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,330
So when doing it,
do you have to use your eyes?

157
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,590
Huh.

158
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,200
How did I do, Babe?

159
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,480
Am I qualified to be your
peer's activity standards?

160
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,000
You acted all innocently

161
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,360
because you wanted to trick
for my car, right?

162
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
I don’t really know your test,

163
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,300
so I didn’t dare to act bold.

164
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,880
Besides, I have never been
friend with benefits with anyone.

165
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,240
I did right or wrong, I really don’t know.

166
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,850
You blend right in.

167
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,920
So, do I pass your probation?

168
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,620
Hello?

169
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,860
Babe, where are you?

170
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,360
Everyone is waiting for you.

171
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,800
We celebrate for No.1
but No.1 doesn’t show up.

172
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,570
I will be there soon.

173
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,450
I was busy with something.

174
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,580
Busy with what?

175
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,290
Did you do the concentration again?

176
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,650
Don’t stand us up.

177
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,470
I’ll be there soon.

178
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,300
I’ve got to go somewhere else.

179
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,010
So, this is it for today, right?

180
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,470
What are you fussed about?

181
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,580
I don’t want to take advantage of you.

182
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,410
I don’t say I let you go back.

183
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,860
Just follow me.

184
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,410
Welcome to
“Ringside Racing”, everyone.

185
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,260
Pit Babe. King of the King.

186
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,500
The hottest guy
in the Thai supercar circle.

187
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,460
Hey, Sonic.

188
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,130
Your dress is outshined
by the channel owner.

189
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,110
This is called “honor
the channel owner. Put it right!

190
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,330
I also want to honor
the latest Champion of the X-Hunter.

191
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,930
Don’t forget that the X-Hunter
never loses in a race.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,110
And I, Sonic, never drop nor fail
in term of fashion.

193
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,620
Hey, everyone listen up.

194
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,790
Babe will treat us tonight.

195
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,100
To be honest, I can treat everyone.

196
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,150
Except both of you, North and Sonic.

197
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,850
By the way, Stop using me
to get the channel's ratings

198
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,830
My fee is

199
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,110
Two Million Baht per scene.

200
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,760
- Hey, Babe
- Hmm?

201
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,980
Your new boy?

202
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,040
Picked up from the roadside.

203
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,270
so I took him with me.

204
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,760
Oh, wow.

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,190
My name is Charlie.

206
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,100
I've been a fan of
the X-Hunter and Babe for a long time.

207
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,270
Please take me under your wing.

208
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,800
Take of what?

209
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,580
You should pass probation first.

210
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,270
Let’s take a bit, guys.

211
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,540
How long will this boy last?

212
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,510
I think it will last for…

213
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,880
two days.

214
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,099
Let’s say three days.

215
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,589
Body like this…

216
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,970
for four days.

217
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,109
Don’t take it seriously. Come on!
Toast for the champ.

218
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,050
Let’s drink.

219
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,390
Cheers.

220
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,569
As expected,

221
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,210
the whole team would hang out here.

222
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,110
Party for Champion?

223
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,360
Do you mind if I join too?

224
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,350
Cheers to Champion.

225
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,400
Whoever competes with this Champion,

226
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,140
he would beat them for all races.

227
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,640
Speaking of which, don’t you think
you are shameless or what?

228
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,340
As no one can beat your senses.

229
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,070
You already lost to me in the track,
and now you really want to mess with me?

230
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,710
So what?

231
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,540
You are just…

232
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
luckier than anyone, right?

233
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,100
Hmm?

234
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,550
Even if I have normal senses like others,

235
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,870
I still can beat a lousy racer
like you anyway.

236
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,990
Do you want to fight for revenge?

237
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,670
What about it?

238
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,580
How much do you want to place a bet?
500,000 Baht?

239
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,590
Deal.

240
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,920
Let’s compete again.

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,880
But I won’t take money for winning a bet.

242
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,230
If I win,

243
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,400
I’ll take your new boy.

244
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,240
He looks like a wimpy,

245
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,300
it will be fun to play with him,

246
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,100
Well…

247
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,650
I…

248
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,810
Deal.

249
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,290
If you have guts to beat me,

250
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,540
you can take him.

251
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,600
You already placed your bet,

252
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,210
so I will get to

253
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,970
choose how we compete.

254
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,250
Hey,
you want to compete in drifting?

255
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,610
You can’t choose to compete
in what you are good at.

256
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,730
This is not fair.

257
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,020
It’s okay.

258
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,600
I haven’t done drifting for quite a while.

259
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,110
It’s good to do it again.

260
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,300
Same racing car,

261
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,300
same horsepower,

262
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,740
the car is exactly the same.

263
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,280
Let the talent do the talking.

264
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,370
Babe.

265
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,780
Please change the bet to something else.

266
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,370
You are so noisy.

267
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,030
I don’t want this.

268
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,740
I don’t want to be with him.

269
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,730
I’d prefer you to him.

270
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,450
Listen! Charlie.

271
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,190
I am Pit Babe.

272
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,900
- I would never lose to anyone.
- I would never lose to anyone.

273
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,620
But anything can happen.

274
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,560
Babe,

275
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,950
I think you should be careful.

276
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,680
People like Winner,
he doesn’t play by the rules.

277
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,660
He can bring it on.

278
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,660
I will be ready for it.

279
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,260
Get in the car. What are you waiting for?

280
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,590
You are the bet, right?

281
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,280
Let’s go.

282
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,010
Come on.

283
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,970
Go!

284
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,060
Winner! Winner! Winner!

285
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,610
Winner! Winner! Winner!

286
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,210
Winner! Winner! Winner!

287
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,620
Awesome!

288
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,450
Great!

289
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,730
Great!

290
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,780
Winner.

291
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,750
All right!, we go to round two.

292
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,550
Winner! Winner! Winner!

293
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,360
Will you be able to crush it?

294
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
Can you handle it?

295
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,830
Winner Winner Winner Winner!

296
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,180
Winner! Winner! Winner!

297
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,270
Babe?

298
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,260
How do you evaluate wins and losses
in a competition like this?

299
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,890
Last lap, Winner followed me
and had to stop as close as possible.

300
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,800
This time, I had to follow him
and stop as close as possible.

301
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,790
Like becoming his shadow,
who gets the closest is the winner?

302
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,530
Let’s go.

303
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,220
He wins.

304
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,560
Pit Babe! Pit Babe! Pit Babe!

305
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,640
Pit Babe! Pit Babe! Pit Babe!

306
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,540
Pit Babe! Pit Babe! Pit Babe!

307
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,950
Pit Babe! Pit Babe! Pit Babe!

308
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,490
Hooray! Yeah!

309
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,970
Hooray!

310
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,340
Hey!

311
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
All right, everyone.

312
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,630
This is clear, right?

313
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,510
For this round, Pit Babe's closer.

314
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,830
So he is the winner.

315
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,800
Next time you will run out of luck.

316
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,410
I’ll get you revenge.

317
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,670
You talk like this every season.

318
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,550
Once you think of the new tactics,
then we compete again.

319
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
North.

320
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,880
What are you looking at?

321
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,380
Hey, Babe,

322
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,550
don’t mess with him too much.

323
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,540
Don't add fuel to the fire with your rival.

324
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,040
I can’t help it.

325
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,560
Talented people will naturally have envious people.

326
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,090
You can drop me here.

327
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,620
Your life is so extreme.

328
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,090
Is the life of every racer be like this?

329
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,730
I can't help it. Or back out and borrow another.

330
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,820
No way.

331
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,320
I will definitely borrow your car.

332
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,590
Because you are No.1,

333
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,360
so your car must be No.1.

334
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,680
It depends on the car-racer.

335
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,100
So,

336
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,100
did I become Babe’s boy?

337
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,720
Today's just a test drive,

338
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,370
so that long-term contract,

339
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,430
I'd think about it.

340
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Do you get it?

341
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,640
Sounds good to me,

342
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,730
I don't want to exploit you.

343
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,450
I got a car after we hooked up once
that’d be too much.

344
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,620
You're so naive,

345
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,540
Be careful, you'll be eaten
until no bones are left.

346
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,510
You're tired, can you drive?

347
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,400
Do you want to take a nap?

348
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,950
I don't go into strangers’ houses.

349
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,340
Okay.

350
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,490
Meet me at the garage tomorrow.

351
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,870
I'll send you the time
and map via Line.

352
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,620
Don't be late.

353
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,530
Okay.

354
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,280
No need to hurry.

355
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Let him struggle a little more.

356
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,510
I also want to know,

357
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,440
how he’s going to escape me.

358
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,460
Woah!

359
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,400
This is like a dream.

360
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,040
Is this really the X-Hunter team?

361
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Why would I lie?

362
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,490
Look around in case
you’ve no chance to go further.

363
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,870
This is your car.

364
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,740
Has Babe ever
brought his boys here?

365
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,160
Of course not, Uncle

366
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,500
this is the first time.

367
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,540
Is he special?

368
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,290
Maybe the whole group lost the bet,

369
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,840
He wasn't likely to
stay for just 1-2 days.

370
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,220
Uncle, pay for me too.

371
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,780
It's always me.

372
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,870
Babe, I’m done
modifying your child.

373
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,580
- Do you want to see?
- Really?

374
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,970
Of course.

375
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,150
I'll be back.

376
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,430
Your friend's too much.

377
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,020
Now he's even brought his boy here,

378
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,930
Have you scolded him?

379
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,530
Let him be,

380
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,900
You say it like you don't know him.

381
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,090
Not long, he'll change
to a new boys.

382
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,400
Because of this, right?

383
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,960
You never dared to
cross the friend zone.

384
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,720
Is it because of this?

385
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,970
I've seen both of you since you were little,

386
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,960
Even an old man like me knows

387
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,940
how you feel about him.

388
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,330
Why don't you try talking to him?
Maybe he has feelings for you too.

389
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,650
No, I think it's better
to stay just like this.

390
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,760
Okay, that's up to you,

391
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,930
but let me warn you,

392
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,750
you know, right?

393
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,110
if a car...

394
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,380
doesn't accelerate

395
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,190
It'll never move forward.

396
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,930
If you keep driving tardily,

397
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,570
It would be a waste of time.

398
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,490
I believe in Babe.

399
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,990
I think he knows where he belongs.

400
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,320
I already told you,

401
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,800
That you can do everything

402
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,440
except the kiss.

403
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,280
Alright.

404
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,530
I'm going home.

405
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,390
Um…

406
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
You don't have to take me back.

407
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,200
I don't think...

408
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,290
you can get up now.

409
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,470
Just leave, I'm going to sleep,

410
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,860
tomorrow I have practice.

411
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,230
Babe,

412
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,510
Do you still want me here tomorrow?

413
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,940
It's 4321.

414
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,650
What's that?

415
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,050
The door's password.

416
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,460
Come meet me at noon, and help
me concentrate before practice.

417
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,920
Of course,

418
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,130
Sweet dreams.

419
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,210
Byebye.

420
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,100
Babe, come eat a sandwich.

421
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,140
Here's some coffee.

422
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,750
What is this?

423
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,170
Roleplaying as a maid?
wear the costume too, then?

424
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,730
I can rear it...

425
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,639
if you want, master.

426
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
What the hell?

427
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,570
I'm just joking,

428
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,290
but if you feel uncomfortable

429
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,280
then just consider it as
an extra option for Babe's boy.

430
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,870
Dare to call yourself that?

431
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,469
I haven't decided yet
whether you passed or not.

432
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,540
We’ve already
test-driven so many rounds,

433
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,250
If it still doesn’t,

434
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,150
Then I’m not coming here again.

435
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,190
What the-

436
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,440
fine, you pass.

437
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,870
I’ll let you be the Babe’s boy.

438
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,070
Could I really become Babe’s boy?

439
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,140
But...

440
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,840
I only help with the car,

441
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,260
as for the audition,

442
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,590
I won't.

443
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,620
One's abilities
are their own, okay?

444
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,850
It's okay, just this is awesome.

445
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,430
Do you want something?

446
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,560
Or would you like some massage?

447
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,860
No.

448
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,990
What's wrong with you?

449
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,160
Thank you, Babe.

450
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,580
Alright.

451
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,260
Continue massaging.

452
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,410
This leg too,

453
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,870
anywhere else?

454
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,320
What are you doing?

455
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,640
A customer asks to
revise the work urgently,

456
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,770
Can I use your house for a while?

457
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,300
if I go to a café,
I'm afraid I’ll submit it late.

458
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,190
Are you working?

459
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,850
Are you a programmer?

460
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,180
You have high expectations of me.

461
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,350
If I were a Programmer then
I wouldn't have to borrow your car.

462
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,800
Right now I'm just
a shabby freelance Editor.

463
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,080
Then your poverty makes sense now.

464
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,960
Please don't worry,

465
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,470
In less than an hour,

466
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,610
I’ll disappear from
your house without a trace.

467
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,960
Don't overreact,

468
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,060
you can go after finishing work.

469
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,030
just a few plugs
won't make me break a sweat.

470
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,350
Are you going out to practice?

471
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,630
Yeah.

472
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,900
Take care then.

473
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,020
When you’re done don't go back,

474
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,510
go meet me at the club,

475
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,090
okay?

476
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,320
Okay.

477
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
Bye-bye.

478
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,820
So?

479
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,910
The new tuning car, how was it?

480
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,990
I think a bit stumbling,

481
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,800
If replaced before
next season it should be fine.

482
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,730
And how stingy will you be?

483
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,890
just change it already.

484
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,130
I'm not stingy,

485
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,810
I just have so many problems.

486
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,670
Even though
I’m superior to everyone,

487
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,020
but if the engine sucks,
Anything can happen.

488
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,190
I know,

489
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,920
I'll take care of it later.

490
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,470
What's wrong?

491
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,720
You look stressed out.

492
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,600
You haven't seen the news.

493
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,930
What news?

494
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,250
The Red Racing Team started moving.

495
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,150
They’re expanding
their team to overthrow us.

496
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,340
I heard them say this every year.

497
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,740
in the end, I still won.

498
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,840
This time it's not just that,

499
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,570
I heard they’ll steal
talented staff too.

500
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,280
If they pay more,
then how can we stop it?

501
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,380
That's true,

502
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,020
but isn't right now we should be
careful of the team's information?

503
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,830
Before the opening season like this

504
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,600
If the information leaks,
that’ll be the worst.

505
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,330
I already told you,

506
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,290
We need to be careful of Charlie.

507
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,750
He has a wimpy face
doesn't mean he can be trusted.

508
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,890
Besides, we still don't know
what his real intention is.

509
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,030
Charlie just wants a car
for the test to join the team.

510
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,660
Can you be serious, Babe?

511
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,650
what? I'm being serious.

512
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,530
I'll be more careful from now.

513
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,640
If he seems fishy,
then I'll dump him too.

514
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Okay?

515
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,570
The new kid stayed more than
three days now, Congratulations.

516
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,470
Thank you.

517
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,410
Huh!

518
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,160
One shot?

519
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,900
Alright.

520
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,170
Hey,

521
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,470
Don't you drink it,

522
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,650
just let adults do.

523
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,480
I'll drink, Way.

524
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Today I have work at the garage,

525
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,770
so you two have dinner together.

526
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,770
What?

527
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,960
you go now?

528
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,140
Yeah, I go now.

529
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,290
See you then.

530
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,220
Okay.
Bye-bye.

531
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,330
Babe,

532
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,170
- Hm?
- Way doesn't like me?

533
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,310
Is it?

534
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,680
You're over thinking.

535
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm naive but I'm not stupid.

536
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,030
He dislikes me.

537
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,810
He’s just worried for his friends.

538
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,360
Just ignore him,

539
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,960
and focus on me.

540
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,990
Why’d you help me
even after three days?

541
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,050
Even though there are many
better guys that you could have?

542
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,070
What's this?

543
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,150
Why asking now?

544
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,140
Well, I want to understand.

545
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,750
Everyone on the team
thinks I'm special,

546
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,030
but I still don't know what was.

547
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,220
You last longer than
other sex buddies...

548
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,510
because you're
indeed special, Charlie.

549
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,010
Part of it is probably because of…

550
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,850
your personality, I guess?

551
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,750
docile,

552
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,740
innocent and soft

553
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,680
when I pet you,

554
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,190
it feels like touching
a golden retriever.

555
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,660
And the thing is,

556
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,460
you're not like other Alphas.

557
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,870
You don't have the pheromone,

558
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,340
so your body and mine are...

559
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,990
considered a perfect match,

560
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,740
got it now?

561
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,790
I got it.

562
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,620
(Babe, have you seen
the news? Watch it now.)

563
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,650
The big news in
the supercar racing world today is

564
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,360
UAC CORP has become the new
sponsor for the Red Racing team.

565
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,450
As you may know,

566
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,250
UAC CORP is currently the No.1
retail business leader in Thailand

567
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,580
and this is considered to be
an unexpected move to the business

568
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,620
as they’ve confirmed that
this investment

569
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,810
will be supervised
by the company's CEO,

570
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,280
Tony Chen himself.

571
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,570
Let's see if UAC Corp will lead the Red Racing Team to victory or not.

572
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,480
You’ve contacted our men, right?

573
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,970
Yes, sir.

574
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,460
Good.

575
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,780
Then emphasized to them

576
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,740
that I didn't care about the method

577
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,890
so just dealt with Pit Babe ASAP.

578
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,580
Hello,

579
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,890
Don't you want to
report about Babe?

580
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,270
Well, let's talk soon.

581
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,500
From news sources, it is expected that Mr. Tony Chen

582
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,320
has decided to invest a huge sum of more than 100 million baht

583
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,270
to bring in foreign racers to strengthen the team.

584
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,860
As for the competitor team, Team X Hunter,

585
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,470
there is no news that there will be any sponsors joining the team.

586
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,370
Can I choose him?

587
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,010
No.

588
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,520
Then I’ll fight instead.

589
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,930
Good that both of you’re here,
I want to ask you a favor.

590
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,770
That's right.

591
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,610
What do you want us to do?

592
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,220
Please keep an eye on Charlie.

593
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,450
Hey, Way.

594
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,240
What about Charlie?

595
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,120
- He looked harmless.
- Yeah.

596
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,300
There, go against him.

597
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,010
Who's going to give up first?

598
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,840
(Come on!)

599
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,040
Ah, no one gave in.

600
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,340
(While practicing)

601
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,370
(Let me intimidate you.)

602
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,500
(This side's also not giving up)

603
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,320
He knows how,
If I can drive a clutch,

604
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,440
I’ll be drifting 360 degrees now,

605
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,490
let's say that.

606
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,940
Charlie, please give Babe
two fingers, two fingers.

607
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,280
(Well done!)

608
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,520
(Okay, cut.)

609
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,190
I thought it gonna be this.

610
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,460
(Thought it was gonna be
a V sign, fighting!)
