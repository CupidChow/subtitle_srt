1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,539
I think it's becoming more and more dangerous.

2
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,140
You know when I see the future it never fails.

3
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,250
We withdraw now, it's still time.

4
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,070
Actually, I feel like you're sad.

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,440
You might want to talk to someone.

6
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,600
Did I guess correctly?

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,050
Don't cry anymore,

8
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm right here.

9
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,060
If I die,

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,810
the power I took will automatically return to its owner.

11
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,259
Do you know?

12
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,130
I'm not selling just living people.

13
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,860
Dead man...

14
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,840
I also sell.

15
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,810
Let me go, let me go.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,620
You're so naughty.

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,820
I'm giving you a chance to get out of this game.

18
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,100
Why are you still stubborn?

19
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,520
The Thai racing industry

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,490
isn't suitable for you, Kim.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,880
Shylock like you

22
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,790
should not have a place in this world.

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,520
Playing dirty and biting like a dog.

24
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,300
You sell people alive.

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,450
How did you do it and are you still human?

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Shut up now.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,280
You did a lot of research about me.

28
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,510
But you still don't know me that well.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,500
Do you know?

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm not selling just living people.

31
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,630
Dead man...

32
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,660
I also sell.

33
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,430
Get up.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,340
The organs of an athlete whose body is still strong like you.

35
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,880
You know what?

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,670
The price is as good as those Alpha specials.

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,620
Go!

38
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,860
-Go! Go!
-Let me go, Tony.

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,400
-Bastard, Jerk!
-Shut up.

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,990
Hey, let me go.

41
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,230
Go!

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,490
Hey, kid.

43
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,540
I intend to make you eat it, please eat it.

44
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,810
Why are you just playing with food?

45
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,910
If you have anything to say to me, just say it.

46
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,060
This time, if you say you will be fired from the garage again,

47
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,850
I will not go back again.

48
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,810
Wait,

49
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,700
who said I'm going to fire you?

50
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,190
Charlie told Babe and everyone that

51
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,600
I was one of Tony's stepsons, too.

52
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,240
If the X-Hunter team doesn't want me
to continue working, I wouldn't be surprised.

53
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,740
I am the adopted son of your enemies.

54
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,080
Well, you can't choose, can you?

55
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,820
I am like a pig

56
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,300
that is raised only to be sold.

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,980
So what,

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,590
are you going to let him do that?

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,790
When you were at the garage, weren't you a bit naughty?

60
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,590
Huh?

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,909
I'm just thinking about the past.

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,780
It was hard for me to escape from there.

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,720
There's no way I'm crawling back there.

64
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,580
I intend to live on my own like Babe.

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,440
Well,

66
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,580
but what is your special ability?

67
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,830
I've never seen you use any special abilities.

68
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,710
If I tell you, can you promise not to tell anyone?

69
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,320
Hey!

70
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,980
If it's such a secret that you don't feel
comfortable telling anyone about it,

71
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,470
you don't have to.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,770
I won't force you.

73
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,030
Everyone who knows about my special abilities is afraid of me.

74
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,740
I don't want that to happen again.

75
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,560
My special ability is

76
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,330
when I touch other people.

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,900
I will see some future that involves that person.

78
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,900
Touch?

79
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,010
Have you ever touched me like that?

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,510
I have never touched and never used my skill with you.

81
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,220
It's only you who likes to come close to me.

82
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,550
Hmm.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,810
It's true.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,280
Is this why you try to avoid other people

85
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,150
and prefer to be alone?

86
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,030
Knowing other people's stories even though we don't want to know.

87
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,740
It's not fun.

88
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,050
I've met people who feared me

89
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,670
and expected me.

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,690
Until

91
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,350
I don't want to tell this to anyone again.

92
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,250
So when you came to tell me this,

93
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,700
weren't you afraid that I would take advantage of you?

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,550
I'm telling you

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,940
because I don't want to be the same person again.

96
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,940
It's so warm outside.

97
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,750
I don't want to live in a cave like before.

98
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,480
It's all because of you

99
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,310
that makes me believe that there are still people like you.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,910
The one

101
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,330
who doesn't think of taking advantage of anyone.

102
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
And is a person who wishes good things to others all over

103
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,410
Okay, let's continue eating.

104
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,680
Speaks well.

105
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,330
So how are you feeling more comfortable?

106
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm more comfortable now.

107
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,010
Then eat.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,140
Hurry, the water is boiling now.

109
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,360
thanks for the other day

110
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,010
If you hadn't dropped me off, I would probably have to sleep around here.

111
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,450
Do you still have any sadness today?

112
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,570
Come and drink alcohol often like this,

113
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,050
I think it's probably not good.

114
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,910
I probably won't go back to the way I was before.

115
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,530
People must have some learning, right?

116
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,400
Some things from the past that hurt us.

117
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,539
Sometimes we have to let it go.

118
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,049
Is it that easy to let go?

119
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,510
There are 2 ways,

120
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,100
if you don't choose to cut it off,

121
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,250
you have to find a way to get revenge.

122
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,420
Sometimes being a good person doesn't get us anything,

123
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,740
and it's better to be a bad person.

124
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,330
But you don't have to lose yourself for anyone.

125
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,450
You've got it wrong.

126
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,860
I haven't lost myself at all.

127
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,220
I just went back and did what I had to do from the beginning.

128
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,400
I treated that glass as thank you for the day before.

129
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,250
June.

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,570
Now everyone knows about me and you.

131
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,180
And Alan also knows what my special sense is.

132
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,660
Would you like me to warn Babe?

133
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,810
Don't do it yet.

134
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,880
I still hope that the bad things you saw

135
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,810
can be changed something.

136
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,890
I'm not sure

137
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,610
whether the future you change

138
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,690
will be better or worse.

139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,400
But you should know this.

140
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,720
I can't let Babe be in danger.

141
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,360
You know, right?

142
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,570
That humans

143
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,110
should not change anything that has been determined by their karma

144
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,100
Otherwise,

145
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,210
the people who interfere with this

146
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,790
will have to suffer endless consequences.

147
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,200
If it can't be changed,

148
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,030
then why have your special sense, Jeff?

149
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,750
I...

150
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,320
I don't know.

151
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,510
I want it to go away too.

152
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,180
Believe me,

153
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,000
everything has its reason.

154
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,760
Including what you see in your future.

155
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,600
I think it's there to remind us

156
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,630
and tell us

157
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,670
what we can still fix.

158
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,310
I will do anything no matter the cost.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,930
Today, UAC Corp has successfully bid
for the Duty-Free store concession at the airport,

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,250
they were defeating competitors like Beyond Group.

161
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,050
As a result, UAC's shares this morning

162
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,450
had the highest trading value in history.

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,460
It's unbelievable that they were finding
the funds to put it up for auction in time.

164
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,640
It's unfortunate, Mr. Pete.

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,480
We missed just a little bit.

166
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,480
As for the next auction, we will bid against UAC Corp.

167
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,800
Would you like me to put in more money?

168
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,520
No, you wouldn't.

169
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,820
Withdrawal from all auctions.

170
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,840
Withdraw?

171
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,410
Yes you do.

172
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,060
A project like that,

173
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,980
no matter how much money you put in, it's not worth it.

174
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,300
I didn't want Beyond Group to compete in the auction in the first place.

175
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,550
I just want to know the source of Tony's funding.

176
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,850
We forced them to spend a lot of money at the last minute like this.

177
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,130
There probably aren't many people

178
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,510
who are ready to transfer a lot of money to him.

179
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,220
and so quickly.

180
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,680
I thought that with this little time,

181
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,310
they wouldn't have time to erase all traces of the money transfer.

182
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,940
Go to find that person.

183
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,320
OK, I'll take care of it.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,520
Is Tony renting this hotel for Kim?

185
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,670
Yes, North and Sonic were the ones to investigate.

186
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,300
He said Kim had not been to Red Racing for several days.

187
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,980
He saw that Tony had a very serious argument with Kim.

188
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,590
He'll cancel the contract.

189
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,530
Stay here, stay here first.

190
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,610
Stay here.

191
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,420
Hey Charlie!

192
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,520
Hey, be careful.

193
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,500
Hey!

194
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,350
Hey, let me go.

195
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,750
Hey Charlie!

196
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,770
Oh, come out here.

197
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,620
Run away.

198
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,690
Go!

199
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,160
The Chen Family Foundation?

200
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,060
This is the child that you signed to adopt.

201
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,650
Promising.

202
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,050
-Are you an Alpha or not?
-Yes.

203
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,920
Tony's house raises only quality children.

204
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,150
If you are interested in sponsoring other orphans,

205
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,630
Our Foundation is very pleased.

206
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,850
There is nothing better than giving these children love

207
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,330
and a place to stay.

208
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,540
Here.

209
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,770
Thank you.

210
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,900
If you want to do something, please stop.

211
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,070
Don't be involved with Mr. Tony.

212
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,290
Otherwise, I won't stop next time for sure.

213
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,420
I think the person who should stop is you.

214
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,480
You know that what you did to those children was wrong.

215
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,910
You're the one who can stop this, Ken.

216
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Has Babe's injury healed yet?

217
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,160
Why doesn't Babe's senses seem the same?

218
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,360
And what I've asked you to do,

219
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,900
when will you succeed?

220
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,170
I've given you too long.

221
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,350
It's Enigma.

222
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,210
Its abilities are already superior to that of a normal Alpha.

223
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,660
Or even a special Alpha like Babe.

224
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,560
In fact, he can't even be compared to you.

225
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,390
Unless

226
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,470
you intend to pull one's punch for him.

227
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,500
I know you don't want to hurt Babe.

228
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,750
In truth, I don't want to raise someone
who doesn't know how to be grateful.

229
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,290
But Babe has special Alpha powers more than anyone else.

230
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,210
I still want to take advantage of him.

231
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,130
I have a choice for you.

232
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,390
I just want you to bring him back to me.

233
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,300
I promise I won't do anything to him.

234
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,010
Long time no see, Jeff.

235
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,140
Let me go.

236
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,160
You've probably forgotten

237
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,530
who you're supposed to be loyal to in this house.

238
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Let me go.

239
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,950
-Jeff?
-Yes.

240
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,790
He said he sent the wrong message.

241
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,730
Do you think they will come here?

242
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,380
No one knows because they can do everything.

243
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,630
Take off your shirt.

244
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,220
What?

245
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,320
Take shirt off.

246
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,560
You!

247
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,680
I saw you fall while dodging bullets

248
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,650
so I'm going to see if you're bruised.

249
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,980
Oh, what are you thinking?

250
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,660
Well

251
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,460
It's not very bruised.

252
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,330
But if you want to heal a wound

253
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,360
I can get hurt.

254
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,660
Charlie, I'll pinch you until it hurts.

255
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,930
Oh, I'm really hurt.

256
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,190
Can you be serious?

257
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,520
Are you hurt anywhere or I'll leave you here?

258
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,130
Come here.

259
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,390
What should I do slowly? Turn around.

260
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,370
Hurry up!

261
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,620
-Be careful of dropping the phone.
-My arm hurts.

262
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,160
So, okay, your arm hurts, right?

263
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,040
I took off your shirt because I was going to heal your wound.

264
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,460
Don't think otherwise.

265
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,040
Let me look at your back.

266
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,900
It hurts a lot?

267
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,130
It feels pain.

268
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,790
So let me look at this wound first because it's bleeding.

269
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,800
From now on, you don't have to go with me.
If you go, you'll get hurt like this.

270
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,280
Anyway, wherever you go, I'll go too.

271
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,010
I'm a Babe fan.

272
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,360
Charlie, you can see that they really did shoot.

273
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,920
I don't have the sense to protect you.

274
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,540
Even myself, I can't survive.

275
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,790
Well, your sense is with me.

276
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,680
I'll

277
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,810
do anything to protect you.

278
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,390
Or do you want me to return Sense to you?

279
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm sorry, Babe.

280
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,520
I'm just kidding.

281
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,570
It isn't a joke, Charlie.

282
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,080
You know that for me to regain my senses

283
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,860
means you must die.

284
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,320
I don't want it.

285
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,440
Just once.

286
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,020
Yes!

287
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,070
But I'm telling the truth that I said I'll do anything to protect you.

288
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,130
OK, I know.

289
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,590
Come!

290
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,530
Please apply this.

291
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,560
Do you feel a stinging?

292
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,210
Stinging.

293
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,010
But if you apply medicine to me, I can bear it.

294
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,420
I haven't recovered yet.

295
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,920
Where else does it hurt?

296
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,190
Right here.

297
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,110
Charlie!

298
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Is it the right time?

299
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,440
It hurts here.

300
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,190
Come on!

301
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,410
Have you recovered yet?

302
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,160
Not yet.

303
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,220
Still?

304
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,060
Where else does it hurt?

305
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,130
So you're falling on both sides?

306
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,130
Have you recovered yet?

307
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,200
Almost recovered.

308
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,630
Is there still more left?

309
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,180
Wow!

310
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,840
So you fell over your whole body?

311
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,990
Where?

312
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,130
This isn't.

313
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,530
Is it better?

314
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,970
If so, Dr. Babe, can you please examine me?

315
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Then you lie down.

316
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,390
Doctor will give you a physical exam.

317
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,880
I'll check where you're injured, is that okay?

318
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,240
OK.

319
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,540
Oh, you're awake?

320
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,090
Are you finished getting dressed?

321
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,670
I finished long ago

322
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,740
Go take a shower, Alan is waiting.

323
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,670
Oh, and how are your arms?

324
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,360
It's gotten better.

325
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,630
Does it hurt?

326
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,870
Okay now.

327
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,110
Does it still hurt?

328
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,180
You're so good.

329
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,330
Okay.

330
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,240
What cream do you use?

331
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,540
Sunscreen.

332
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,420
Do you know DD cream?

333
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,250
I didn't know you used those.

334
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,570
Anyone can have a powder face.

335
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,390
But it can't be me.

336
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's go take a shower.

337
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,170
Charlie.

338
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,260
Before you kiss, please brush your teeth first.

339
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,510
Charlie.

340
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,800
Go brush your teeth.

341
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
Go take a shower too.

342
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll give you a kiss, okay?

343
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,490
I will give you a french kiss.

344
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,410
Okay.

345
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,930
-Look, you're in a hurry.
-Go, go, go.

346
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,080
Oh, you did this to relieve your shyness.

347
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,820
You can stay with me.

348
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,790
Hurry up!

349
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,730
Why don't you just let me kiss you if I don't brush my teeth?

350
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,000
My mouth doesn't smell bad at all.

351
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,630
Are you secretly using my toothbrush, Charlie?

352
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,060
Are you thinking of tricking me into indirectly kissing me?

353
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,670
Please hurry. Alan is waiting.

354
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,570
Hey hey!

355
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,750
We’ve gotten out of hand.

356
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,610
-It doesn't look good.
-That's it.

357
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,300
Do they do this at all?

358
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,950
Should we report it?

359
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,390
Let the police come to help.

360
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,670
I've filed a report

361
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,480
but we can't just rely on the police.

362
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,520
Until the police find him Kim would definitely become fertilizer.

363
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,260
Earlier you said that the police couldn't do anything.

364
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,860
So what can we do?

365
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,790
Wouldn't it be better for us not to be busy?

366
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,950
Hey!

367
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,460
If we work together, Mr. Tony can't do anything.

368
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,230
Oh my gosh, it sounds like a Marvel movie.

369
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,530
Uncle, this is really blood.

370
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,970
This time it seems to really hurt and really die.

371
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,470
Even though we're afraid, it's of no use.

372
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,010
Now they're targeting us.

373
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,450
No matter how we escape, Tony will still attack us.

374
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,180
The only way is to fight back.

375
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,880
We must take him down.

376
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,220
That's what I thought.

377
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,060
If there was another way for us to choose, it would be good.

378
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,920
But it seems like we just have to fight.

379
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,470
That's it.

380
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,670
So what should we do?

381
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,700
If you want us to do something, just tell us.

382
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,450
I don't want to stay still and wait for him to attack us.

383
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,940
North, Sonic.

384
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,810
Yes.

385
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,640
I want the two of you to go spy on Winner

386
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,770
to find clues about where Kim was taken.

387
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,660
Okay.

388
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,730
Babe, what's the evidence we'll use against Tony?

389
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,360
You don't have to worry about that.

390
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,770
I can find a way.

391
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,810
Way, I want you to help.

392
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,850
-It's me.
-Yes.

393
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,420
Now all we're missing is evidence against Tony.

394
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,230
I need witnesses to confirm that Tony really sold the kid to a rich man.

395
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,900
But right now our problem is that we can't reach their customers at all.

396
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,990
But I found this one.

397
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,840
Is this person a customer at your showroom?

398
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,690
Yes, a good customer.

399
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,550
Buy only top model cars.

400
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,060
But as far as I know, Mr. Dong is the hotel owner.

401
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,960
Yes!

402
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,950
I've searched for information.

403
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,670
He is a member at the BU Club and charitable associations.

404
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,660
So what's strange about it?

405
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,890
What is strange is this association

406
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
had to pay millions to become a member.

407
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,450
I've searched all the names, and they're all related to Tony.

408
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,600
If so, it means that this association cannot be trusted.

409
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,130
Yes.

410
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,120
Way, I want you to find a way to take me to meet them.

411
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,120
Ok, I'll take care of it.

412
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,800
Way, I'm sorry that day I missed an appointment.

413
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,930
But I can explain.

414
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,080
I went to talk to Charlie about Tony's human trafficking.

415
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,490
So I didn't go to see you.

416
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,330
I know.

417
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,200
But would you have told me that you had reconciled with Charlie?

418
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,740
I wouldn't have to wait.

419
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,420
Or because in the past you saw that I always waited for you?

420
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,280
So you thought you could do anything to me.

421
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,190
Well, I'm really sorry.

422
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,280
Even though I came first, Babe?

423
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,220
Did you make an appointment with me first?

424
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,560
Am I really still important to you?

425
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,880
Way, you're important to me.

426
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,000
You're my only close friend.

427
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,750
If you want me to get rid of my anger, you can take me to dinner.

428
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,250
But I don't eat at Auntie's old restaurant anymore.

429
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,090
Well, yes.

430
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,010
If you want to eat at any restaurant, just choose.

431
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,880
Or do you want to eat at an expensive Western restaurant?

432
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,989
Or Omakase?

433
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
How to do it?

434
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,400
I'm totally fine.

435
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,469
Don't pretend to be smart.

436
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,920
I'll order food until you're completely penniless.

437
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,120
Oh, come on.

438
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,949
Just one friend, I can take care of you.

439
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,300
I can take care of you for the rest of my life.

440
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,340
Go.

441
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,820
What are you doing here alone?

442
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,730
Phong.

443
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,480
-Yes.
-Where is Jeff?

444
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,730
Haven't seen him since morning.

445
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,110
Is he on leave?

446
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,220
Did Jeff tell anyone about his leave?

447
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,940
He didn't tell anyone.

448
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,400
-Thank you very much.
-Yes.

449
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,250
Normally he never leaves.

450
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,940
Why did you turn off the phone?

451
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,360
Hey Sonic, why do we have to care about Kim?

452
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,700
Damn, he's our competitor.

453
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,300
Are you going to let a person die in front of you?

454
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,530
Oh, oh!

455
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,980
What if this happened to me?

456
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,540
Will you help me?

457
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,800
Let's say, let's say if Tony took me like this.

458
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,810
Will you go find me?

459
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,850
No.

460
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,440
Well, I'll have it easy on the ear.

461
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,540
Hey hey!

462
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,750
I'm your friend.

463
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,460
Then who tell me that I love you like a friend.

464
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,890
Oh, oh, oh!

465
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,860
And if I'm not a friend so what could it be?

466
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,560
That's enough.

467
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,900
Winner has been going there for a long time.

468
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
How do we take it?

469
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,010
Alan still hasn't arrived.

470
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
If so, we'll go ahead and do it ourselves.

471
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,700
Hey North!

472
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,950
Wait for me.

473
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,720
The BU Association will have a party every Saturday
at the end of the month at Mr. Dong's hotel.

474
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,390
Most of them come to show off their wealth and build connections.

475
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,820
Only members of the association can enter the event.

476
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,360
Because every door in the event will have very strict guards.

477
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,390
But you guys must hurry

478
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,970
because I have already made
a special appointment to offer Mr. Dong a new car.

479
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,950
Please wait here for a moment. I'd like to inform Mr. Dong first.

480
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,140
I only have 15 minutes to close this deal.

481
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,430
Any longer than that and I would be kicked out immediately.

482
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,800
Are you guys ready?

483
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,360
-So what do you say?
-Things like this.

484
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,270
-Okay.
-There's a lot of it.

485
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,150
-Please come.
-Won't you just ask?

486
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,130
I'd rather give in.

487
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,710
Are you hungry?

488
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,870
Wait a moment, the game is almost over.

489
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,100
If so, I'll put in an additional 5 million.

490
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,890
Sense can see through objects for sure.

491
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,780
You look so confident, Mr. Dong.

492
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,500
Just for fun.

493
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,150
We're just playing for fun.

494
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,350
How are you?

495
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,910
-Do you see the beautiful cards?
-Very nice.

496
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,700
But I think today is not your day, Mr. Tong.

497
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,890
I win.

498
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,360
Then I'd like to take a break for a moment.

499
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,610
You guys go get something to eat first and then start the game again.

500
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,050
-Okay.
-Okay.

501
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,200
Just this is okay.

502
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,560
-Oh Mr. Way.
-Hello, Mr. Dong.

503
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,870
If you have anything to say, I have 5 minutes for you.

504
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,120
Just 5 minutes?

505
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,160
I'm afraid it won't be enough.

506
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,220
Oh, there's no way.

507
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,320
You don't have to talk too much, I'll buy it with you.

508
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,450
Today I just want to choose the color of my car.

509
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,810
Andy, go get something to eat first.

510
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,260
Then come back in time before starting a new game.

511
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,420
-Then I'll start.
-Alright, let's start.

512
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,910
How did you guys get in?

513
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,690
Take it easy.

514
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,650
Take it easy.

515
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,870
Your name is Andy, right?

516
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,640
Take it easy.

517
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,000
-Daddy sent you guys, right?
-No, no, no.

518
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,300
Calm down, I'm from the foundation too.

519
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,380
I just want to help you out.

520
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,450
Andy doesn't want to work for Daddy, doesn't it?

521
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Andy.

522
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,260
I need corroborating evidence against Tony.

523
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,150
I need proof that he didn't give the children up for adoption.

524
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,910
but rather sent them to be sold to rich people for their use.

525
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,290
If Andy can help me,

526
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,860
I guarantee Andy will be safe.

527
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,130
No.

528
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,760
You guys can't help me.

529
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,260
No one can help me.

530
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,370
He has a GPS installed.

531
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,390
Even if I ran away,

532
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,470
he would be able to follow me.

533
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,260
They'll definitely kill me.

534
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,620
Andy, calm down.

535
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,040
Everything isn't that bad.

536
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,600
I've lived in that house before.

537
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,180
But I escaped.

538
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,700
If I can escape,

539
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,620
Andy can escape.

540
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,160
I'll help you.

541
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,880
Trust me.

542
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,860
I can help you.

543
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,130
It's okay. It's okay.

544
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,580
It's okay.

545
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,370
What are you doing here?

546
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
So who did you come with?

547
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,250
Andy, Mr. Dong is looking for you.

548
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,260
Go quickly!

549
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,050
Hurry up!

550
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,620
Babe, be careful.

551
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,400
Come on!

552
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,630
Charlie, go!

553
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,070
Sit down!

554
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,780
Babe, go.

555
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,110
Charlie, go!

556
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,350
Sonic.

557
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,240
Winner is there.

558
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,820
Go.

559
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,290
What is Winner doing here?

560
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,900
Shit.

561
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,330
There's bodyguards.

562
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,930
This probably isn't normal.

563
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,760
Give me the cell key.

564
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,160
Bring it quickly.

565
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,060
There will be more children coming soon.

566
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,080
Everyone is waiting here.

567
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,790
I'm going to go say hello to an old friend.

568
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,090
But...

569
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,270
Why?

570
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,100
I'm your master's henchman.

571
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,040
Or do you guys have a problem?

572
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,350
Please eat a little to fill your stomach.

573
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,710
Can you still look cheerful with this much pain?

574
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,060
Just eat something delicious and the pain will go away.

575
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,950
Come quickly.

576
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,880
I'm sorry.

577
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,610
That makes you hurt like this.

578
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,490
I told you there's no need to apologize.

579
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,120
I'm ready to do anything for you.

580
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,500
But that doesn't mean you have to trade your life for me.

581
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,420
Is it worth it, may I ask?

582
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,740
Definitely worth it.

583
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,690
Just being with you, no matter the price, is worth it.

584
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,220
Charlie.

585
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,500
Hmm.

586
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,630
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

587
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,690
I don't want you to get hurt because of me, do you understand?

588
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,320
I know.

589
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,930
However, I definitely won't let you go through this alone.

590
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,710
Okay.

591
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,050
But if you get hurt, don't complain later.

592
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,890
I'm very strong.

593
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,960
What's up, Kim?

594
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,120
-You're so pathetic.
-That's Kim.

595
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,160
I've told you before.

596
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,830
Don't go into Mr. Tony's business.

597
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,090
Do you want to be a gentleman?

598
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,300
As for the race, you don't have to worry.

599
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,360
Even without you,

600
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,040
Red Racing would still win.

601
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,610
But only me is the champion.

602
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,580
Good luck, friend.

603
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,280
Oh, door lock.

604
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,380
North!

605
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,810
Do you consider yourself to be a Khun Pan?

606
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,750
Oh, I saw in the movie that he could do this too.

607
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,190
Huh!

608
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,160
They'll be here soon.

609
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,760
Put it away now.

610
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,840
Damn it.

611
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,630
Hey!

612
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,080
Can't do it.

613
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,720
I do it.

614
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,900
Go away.

615
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,300
Hey, Kim.

616
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,500
Kim.

617
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,920
Oh!

618
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,640
Can you walk?

619
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,330
Can you walk?

620
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,380
Hey!

621
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,440
-Damn it.
-You guys stop.

622
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,660
-Oh!
-This way.

623
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,900
-Oops.
-Fuck.

624
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,070
Hey Sonic!

625
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,430
Run away.

626
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,040
Sonic runs away.

627
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,500
-North, but you.
-I told you to run away.

628
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,200
You go get together.

629
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,430
You guys are really nosy.

630
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,370
You guys really want to help him, right?

631
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,550
-Huh?
-Winner.

632
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,180
People like you are trash.

633
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,540
Oh, go ahead and say it.

634
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,260
Oh damn it.

635
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,400
-Get in the car quickly.
-Uncle.

636
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,050
Really annoyed.

637
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,420
Hello Mr. Pete.

638
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,060
Hello!

639
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,280
Are you interested in any children today?

640
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,250
Pete, you asshole!

641
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,820
Have you known this all along?

642
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,240
You are the only Enigma left in our home.

643
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,080
Internship here, pay very well.

644
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,060
Can I now call myself Alan's Boy?

645
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,040
You know that no matter what happens, right?

646
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,460
You're the only reason I'm here.

647
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,960
The qualifying round has begun.
They've already started.

648
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,860
Now maintaining distance.

649
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,190
Winner continued to blocked well
and entered the final straight.

650
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,250
What if I had a plan
to bring Charlie back to this house?

651
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,000
(So excited.)
(No, no, no.)

652
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,780
(Lean in, lean in)

653
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,790
(Oh, oh, oh!)
Go together.

654
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,230
(Turn around and look at him)
(Why can't I just run out?)

655
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,570
(Someone got hurt.)

656
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,730
It just went to the lock.

657
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,630
When I said "oh" it's real

658
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,230
(Action queue, Mr. Pavel likes it.)

659
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,210
(Run away quickly...)

660
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,460
(Someone is already panting 1 ea.)
Cut, cut!!

661
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:21,930
(And the younger ones have a lot of fun.)
(Walk like Charlie's.)

662
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,250
(Babe's puppy)
