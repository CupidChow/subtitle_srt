1
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,789
So,

2
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,470
did you know that your boy Charlie is Jeff's older brother?

3
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,960
He just told the people at the garage
that they were brothers who grew up together.

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Huh

5
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,430
If I can beat Charlie I'll get the race instead of Babe, right?

6
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,810
Who said I'm going to let you guys race each other?

7
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,420
The two of you have to race with Babe.

8
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,600
Only those who defeat him will have the right to race in his place.

9
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,350
What's wrong?

10
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,820
What's with the glum face?

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,160
Are you worried?

12
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,380
I'm worried.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,280
Even the best racers still can't beat you.

14
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,540
Who am I to be able to beat you?

15
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm not passing.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,230
- I'm going to tell Alan that I'm withdrawing.
- Charlie.

17
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,370
Listen to me.

18
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,810
If you underestimate your abilities

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,350
then you should withdraw.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,030
You've practiced a lot.

21
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,790
If you don't have anything good, I won't let you race in my place.

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,010
Babe.

23
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,110
If you give up before starting,

24
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,230
then don't race.

25
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,950
But if you want to fight,

26
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
you must fight to the utmost.

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,300
Okay.

28
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,620
I will beat you.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Yes!

30
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,400
It has to be like this.

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,710
This is worthy of being my competitor.

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,500
At first I thought I'd give it to you after the race.

33
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,120
But I've changed my mind.

34
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,640
Is this engraved with my name?

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,010
Yes!

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,690
Thank you, Babe.

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
Do you like it?

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,950
I like it.

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,120
Charlie.

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Charlie.

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,940
When you're on the field you have to do your best, understand that?

42
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,320
Because I will definitely pull no punch.

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,170
You don't think Babe will help his fanboy win?

44
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,400
If someone like Babe were to do something like that,

45
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,880
I think he would rather die.

46
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,860
Ready!

47
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Go!

48
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,230
Yes!

49
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,860
This kid's skills are not ordinary.

50
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,890
Damn it!

51
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,310
That's awesome, Babe.

52
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,610
You're still not recovered, but you leave every racer in the dust.

53
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,380
How can I do this? The ability is embedded in my bones.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,470
Even if I'm hurt, I'm good...

55
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,090
I'm sorry, Babe, that I lost.

56
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,570
Never mind!

57
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,020
But the rule is that if you lose, you can't race.

58
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
I know.

59
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Charlie.

60
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,630
This loss

61
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,210
is considered to be the beginning.

62
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,110
If you don't stop trying,

63
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,150
the day will be yours.

64
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes!

65
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,880
Thank you, Alan, for giving me the opportunity.

66
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,550
Until my skills improve, I will ask to join the team again.

67
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
Wait a minute!

68
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,700
Did I tell you back?

69
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,290
Yes.

70
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,340
I haven't told you the results yet.

71
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,980
So you've just given up?

72
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,340
Maybe I'll change my mind and fire you?

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,010
Welcome to X- Hunter, Charlie.

74
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,610
You are suitable to race in place of Babe.

75
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,470
Are you telling the truth?

76
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,210
- Hmm.
- Did I really join the X- Hunter team?

77
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,440
Well, that's right.

78
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,550
Thanks.

79
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,409
Charlie.

80
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,050
I did it, I joined the X- Hunter team and I raced in your place.

81
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,890
What are you so happy about?

82
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,640
You're not even a champion yet, just got on the team.

83
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,050
Alan.

84
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,410
Alan!

85
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,520
Why do you do this?

86
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,430
Why do you give an outsider like Charlie more of a chance than me

87
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,050
who has been with you for a long time?

88
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,890
I practice every day more than North and Sonic

89
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,470
and even more than Way.

90
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,450
In order to be like Babe.

91
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,230
But you didn't give me a chance.

92
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,130
You never valued me.

93
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,580
I always value you.

94
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,559
I know you have determination and dreams.

95
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,700
I intend to support you too and have given everything I can to help you.

96
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,530
You know what?

97
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,800
Why can a new kid like Charlie beat you on the field?

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Why? Why?

99
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,850
Because he is more decisive and brave than you.

100
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,360
And no one can teach you about this.

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
No matter how hard you try, if your heart is still afraid.

102
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,020
You can't reach him.

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,860
Don't think too much.

104
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,250
I promise.

105
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,350
If you keep fighting,

106
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,440
the next opportunity might be yours.

107
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,550
Charlie.

108
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Yes.

109
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,800
Have you talked to Jeff lately?

110
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,910
When will he come back to work?

111
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't often talk to him.

112
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,700
Why do you ask about him?

113
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,920
Nothing.

114
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,960
I just want to know when he will return to work.

115
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,880
Jeff isn't coming back to work, he told you he quit.

116
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Charlie,

117
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,420
do you have a way to help me apologize to Jeff?

118
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,570
I accidentally hurt his feelings.

119
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,760
Now I call and he doesn't answer.

120
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,310
Looks like my number has been blocked as well.

121
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,500
So why do you have to want to reconcile with Jeff?

122
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,870
There are many other technicians.

123
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,650
So,

124
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,010
your brother is skilled.

125
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,930
He has a good heart and likes to help others.

126
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,050
Even though he likes to act like a precocious adult.

127
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,550
And like this, how can I let him quit easily?

128
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,050
So if you insist it must be Jeff.

129
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,790
You have to go get him back.

130
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,340
He looks quiet, but he is a soft- hearted person.

131
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,470
Really?

132
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,760
These days, he likes coffee and often goes to his favorite cafe.

133
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,740
I'll send you the location.

134
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,550
Hey!

135
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,620
Thank you very much.

136
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,350
- Okay.
- Send it quickly.

137
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
What?

138
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,600
Have you ever said you stopped smoking?

139
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,650
So why? Are you worried about me?

140
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,950
That's right, because I have only you in my life.

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,900
No, Babe, you already have Charlie.

142
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Charlie is Charlie, you are you.

143
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,750
If you think I'm upset that Alan brought Charlie onto the team,

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,420
let me tell you, I'm not.

145
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm dissatisfied

146
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,880
because you allow the one who has low experience to race for you.

147
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,900
You know,

148
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,130
if it were in the past, you would never have made this decision.

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,350
Because you value practice and practice hours.

150
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,590
If you practice little and don't practice enough,

151
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,410
you will never be allowed to race.

152
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,360
Well, yes, but Charlie is very good.

153
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,110
I'm the one who trained him.

154
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,060
I can tell you guys are probably tutoring a lot, right?

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,030
Your fanboy has arrived.

156
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,410
Let's go.

157
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, I'll go first.

158
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,260
Hello, this is "Song Request" time.

159
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,940
Before we listened to the beautiful song,
someone asked to apologize to Jeff.

160
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,070
The One who sits at table number 8.

161
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,600
"I'm so sorry From A."

162
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,320
Hopefully "A" will be able to successfully reconcile with Jeff.

163
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,570
This song is a song that "A" requested for you.

164
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,950
He wanted to send a message to Jeff.

165
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,800
(Kid, I'm sorry.)

166
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,800
(Sorry that I don't trust you.)

167
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,290
(Sorry that I don't trust you.)

168
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,990
(Sorry to disappoint you.)

169
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,510
(Please forgive me.)

170
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,490
(Please forgive me.)

171
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,630
(I'm sorry.)

172
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,250
(I'm sorry.)

173
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:57,410
(I'm sorry.)

174
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,790
(I'm sorry.)

175
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,140
Very old joke.

176
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,860
Nowadays, who is reconciled by requesting songs through DJs?

177
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,550
Love actually?

178
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,200
The movie is old for ages.

179
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,060
These days, there aren't any good romance movies.

180
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,840
I've never reconciled with anyone.

181
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,880
This is the first time.

182
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,340
Please rate my effort.

183
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,710
But I'm embarrassed others.

184
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,970
If you're embarrassed, what can you do?

185
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,850
Well, you avoided me and blocked my phone number.

186
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
So why do you want to talk to me?

187
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,950
You said I'm not suitable to be with anyone else.

188
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,880
I should be alone.

189
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,230
I beg your pardon.

190
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,370
That I judged you like that.

191
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,690
Even though I don't know anything.

192
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,730
It's my fault that I don't trust you.

193
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,290
Even though in the past you have always done your best for the team.

194
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,220
I just wish well.

195
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,770
I want you to open your mind and get to know other people.

196
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,730
I don't want you to be lonely anymore.

197
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,130
At least

198
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,930
you can try opening your heart and getting to know me.

199
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,030
How can a person be alone in this world?

200
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,040
Hm, is it true?

201
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll try it out.

202
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,470
But I don't know if it will work.

203
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
Because I'm a caveman.

204
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Hey!

205
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,780
If you were a caveman,

206
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,320
I'd be the one to dig you out of the cave.

207
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,410
Huh!

208
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,590
Kid.

209
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,880
Huh, huh!

210
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,359
Huh, sulky kid.

211
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,200
Have you stopped sulk?

212
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,819
Who sulk?

213
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,369
Stop putting on airs now.

214
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,160
Oops, you're secretly smiling.

215
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,329
What?

216
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,630
Please smile.

217
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,790
Will Dean and Alan have issues?

218
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,780
Are you worried about this?

219
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Well, I don't want to be the cause of the two of them fighting.

220
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,890
And if those two are fighting, it's not about you, right?

221
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,110
Besides, I trust Alan.

222
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,360
He knows who should be where at what time.

223
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,630
As for Dean,

224
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,370
now might not be his time.

225
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,490
Yes!

226
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
So let's go celebrate Babe's Boy becoming a racer, shall we?

227
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,460
Wherever you want to go, I'll take you.

228
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,790
Better not go.

229
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,050
Today you have forced your body a lot, so go home and rest.

230
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,950
Charlie, how naive are you?

231
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,380
How?

232
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,810
When I ask, I don't mean do you want to go?

233
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,280
But I'm asking because I want to take you to celebrate.

234
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,930
You're too good a kid.

235
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,370
Well, I'm a good kid. You'll fall in love with me.

236
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,100
Charlie.

237
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,850
I know where it takes you.

238
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,380
Oh, I wonder where this is going.

239
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,950
We've been sitting here waiting for an hour.

240
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,550
What are you waiting for?

241
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,630
Come on, wait a second.

242
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,360
How beautiful!

243
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,150
Are there many stars like this here?

244
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,830
Hmm.

245
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,430
When I come to practice late at night,

246
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,910
I like to lie here.

247
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,790
I thought you had brought other people on dates here.

248
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Why?

249
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,510
It popped into my head

250
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,220
that you had definitely brought someone here.

251
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,200
I've never brought anyone here

252
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,820
except you.

253
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,240
I don't want you to be a Babe's boy anymore.

254
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,080
Why?

255
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,610
Let's be boyfriend.

256
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,510
Do you want to have children?

257
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,840
What?

258
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you want to have children?

259
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,400
Charlie, how can I have one?

260
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,790
Since you and I are both Alphas

261
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,390
I mean.

262
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,160
Have you ever thought about having children?

263
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,950
Regardless of whether I'm Alpha or Enigma.

264
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,480
Why do you ask?

265
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,150
You want to have one?

266
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,900
We've only been boyfriend for a few minutes.

267
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,300
So you're thinking of starting a family?

268
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,500
I was just thinking for fun.

269
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,550
That if we had a baby.

270
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,200
If baby calls me Papa and call you Mama

271
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,370
it would be cute.

272
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,080
Why do I have to be a Mama?

273
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,860
Because it suits you. Mama.

274
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,180
How suitable?

275
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,650
Mama.

276
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,210
Don't call me like that, I'm ticklish.

277
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,610
Don't you like being called that, Mama?

278
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,030
Don't make sounds like that.

279
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,250
Babe, what are we doing at the locker?

280
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,260
Because I want to reminisce

281
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,670
when I first met you.

282
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,930
Hmm.

283
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,560
You were a stranger then.

284
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,270
But now we're lovers.

285
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,800
Mama wants to know

286
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,110
if Papa has developed anything.

287
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,130
What is this?

288
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,180
Mama, do you want to test Papa again?

289
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm okay.

290
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,450
Things like this,

291
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,240
if you start, you can't stop.

292
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,260
If you want to try it,

293
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,400
you have to test it.

294
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,500
But I can't see it.

295
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,370
When making love,

296
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,610
do you have to use your eyes?

297
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,530
Who would have thought that Uncle would really bring Charlie into the team?

298
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,010
Have you looked at what he recorded?

299
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,750
I think he drives well.

300
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,670
I understand, but our team
we still have Dean who waiting to go on a Big Stage.

301
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,350
I don't know whether he will be disappointed or not.

302
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,490
Are you crazy? Dean isn't like that.

303
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,010
Are you hurt?

304
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,570
Dean!

305
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,240
- North.
- Why?

306
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,460
Why can't I be a badass? Huh!

307
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,120
What will I do good for?

308
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,490
But you're upset that you didn't get to the Big Stage.

309
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,900
That's right, why?

310
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,600
The two of you are the same.

311
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,720
Stop acting like a nice kid to Alan.

312
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,730
If you think he will be kind, I'm annoyed.

313
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,360
No matter how hard you practice, your skills will still be as bad as ever.

314
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,900
Uncle!

315
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,450
Do you think I'm being kind to you?

316
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,520
So you think you can do anything?

317
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,030
From now on, I will prohibit Dean

318
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,510
from going to the garage or practice field for one week.

319
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,160
If you still can't separate work and personal life,

320
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,280
then you don't have to practice with other people.

321
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,980
Do you really think that you still want to be this kind of person?

322
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,440
If you're stressed, it's better to let it out.

323
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,400
He's getting angry.

324
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,180
If you interfere now, you'll only lose each other.

325
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,970
Leave him alone, he'll figure it out.

326
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm not sure he can figure it out.

327
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,540
And if he can't figure it out, what more can you do?

328
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,630
I don't want to be the person who decides who's right or wrong.

329
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,010
But performance on the field and time statistics

330
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,370
never lie.

331
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,570
Dean had to accept and get over this on his own.

332
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,180
I understand.

333
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,120
I think everyone on the team saw what you were trying to do for X- Hunter.

334
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,470
Dean might need time to understand this.

335
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,460
And you, what is your dream?

336
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,830
My dream?

337
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,010
I want to sleep well.

338
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,040
Don't have to know about other people and live life peacefully.

339
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,780
Probably just this.

340
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,870
In addition to being a caveman,

341
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,630
you are also a strange human being.

342
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,010
Your dreams are very strange.

343
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,250
But it sounds kind of you, kid.

344
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,660
When will you stop calling me Kid?

345
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
I don't stop.

346
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,590
If I don't want to call you Kid, what do you want me to call?

347
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,970
Darling?

348
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,790
Alan, you have a bad mouth.

349
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,330
What the fuck?

350
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,600
Kid Kid, wait a minute.

351
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,710
Are you angry?

352
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,610
Can you assume I didn't say?

353
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Kid!

354
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,990
Hey!

355
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,670
You...

356
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,600
Hey! Why did you get in my car?

357
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,410
Well, I don't want to drive today.

358
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,280
Please take me along.

359
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,850
Tonight there's a party to welcome Charlie to the team.

360
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,600
I'm not going to party, I'm going home.

361
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,710
Why?

362
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,670
That's your brother.

363
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,150
Let's have fun together.

364
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,830
Then it's fine.

365
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,320
So you send me off first.

366
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,760
How is it possible? It's different ways.

367
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,600
Come on, I'll treat you to a meal.

368
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,410
I don't want to eat.

369
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,950
If so,

370
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,330
is it considered an order from the supervisor? OK?

371
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,200
Hey, is that why you refused to drop me off
because the gasoline was expensive?

372
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,700
I'll pay for the gasoline.

373
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,700
This car is not only good to drive but also economical on fuel.

374
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,430
Just drop you off, no problem.

375
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,740
But I'm angry at old people who like to annoy me.

376
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Oh?

377
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,600
Whose house is this?

378
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,390
My dad's old house

379
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,570
At first, someone bought it to run a restaurant.

380
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,460
But I already bought it back.

381
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,890
When I bought it

382
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,750
I wanted to tear it all down.

383
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,990
I don't want to keep it.

384
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,680
Because it makes me miss my dad

385
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,340
and thinking about the past that I don't want to remember

386
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,110
But I couldn't do it, Charlie.

387
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,570
It's like something is holding me back.

388
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,360
Don't let me go on.

389
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,950
But I think the time has come.

390
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,179
That I should do something

391
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,360
What do you think I should do?

392
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,380
Do what you want to do.

393
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:26,920
I know you have the answer in mind.

394
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Why?

395
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,030
Can't I just ask Boyfriend's opinion?

396
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,790
Can't I ask Papa's opinion?

397
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,770
I really mean it.

398
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,040
I know that you know what is best for you.

399
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,659
But no matter what you decide

400
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,340
I'm always ready to be by your side.

401
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,550
Well, I know.

402
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,090
And the weather is so good.

403
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,380
Shall we open a cafe?

404
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,600
A cafe?

405
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,210
I see now people like to set up cafes on the waterfront.

406
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,300
So you told me to think about it myself?

407
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,520
You think like you're the landlord.

408
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,690
Wait,

409
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,710
- What?
- don't move.

410
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,770
Go back first.

411
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,290
Oh, I don't take photos.

412
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,900
- Come on, just one pic.
- No.

413
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,190
- Please, one more pic.
- No.

414
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,370
Just one pic.

415
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,180
No, not even one.

416
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,920
Please, mama.

417
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,590
Don’t try to coax me.

418
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,560
- No, no, no, no.
- Please.

419
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,700
Please, just one pic.

420
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,990
Okay, fine.

421
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,320
Took it together.

422
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,350
Okay.

423
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,090
What?

424
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,740
Charlie.

425
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,030
Hmm.

426
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,300
Oh, Jeff.

427
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,370
So you're back to the garage?

428
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,540
Yes, I'm back to being an intern,

429
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,070
I'll be your pain in the ass for a while.

430
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,550
Have a word with me.

431
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,020
It's about my misunderstanding between you and Charlie.

432
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,920
It's fine, I get it.

433
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,400
Many people probably think like you too.

434
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,180
Yeah, but I still have to apologize to you.

435
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,900
for getting rowdy at you like that.

436
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,760
By the way, you're serious about Charlie, right?

437
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,010
If you're playing with him, then I suggest you to better stop now.

438
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,210
Charlie isn't someone who can be thrown off as easily as other Babe's boys.

439
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,470
That, I quite know.

440
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,580
But also I've never felt good like this with anyone before.

441
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,830
Your brother is the only one that I want to be with for a long time.

442
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,410
I don't want to hear any of this.

443
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,240
Let's just say, if you're really serious then I don't mind.

444
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,570
I'm serious.

445
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,610
If it weren't for Charlie, then I wouldn't come to discuss this with you.

446
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,150
Jeff, you're Charlie's brother, so you're my brother too.

447
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,820
Alright, from now on if someone bullies you

448
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,750
or even Uncle Alan who did, you can come to me and complain.

449
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,120
I'll take care of it for you.

450
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,800
Okay, but I probably don't need your help.

451
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,870
I think I can handle Alan by myself.

452
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,110
Oh, give me a break,

453
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,610
Please be kind to him.

454
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,660
He likes you a lot.

455
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,290
Huh?

456
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,950
What's wrong?

457
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Nothing.

458
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,970
Are you sure?

459
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,300
I want to go to the bathroom first,

460
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,940
I'll follow you in later, you go ahead.

461
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,570
Alright.

462
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,860
Charlie, he'll come soon.

463
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,330
Come on.

464
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,360
you keep looking for him.

465
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,750
Ah, see? There he is.

466
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,500
Your boy looking for you, I guess his neck might crack now.

467
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,470
I'm just worried, I'm afraid that he'll get lost.

468
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,610
Lost what? Lost in love?

469
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,730
What the hell?

470
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,540
He's been drinking here long before you ever came.

471
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:36,040
- Coming.
- Coming.

472
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,150
It's too extra.

473
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,600
Of course, It needs to be extra.

474
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,150
I guess this isn't just an ordinary Babe's boy, right?

475
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,460
That's right.

476
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,370
Other than introducing a new team member,

477
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,120
Do you want to do other "introducing"?

478
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,360
- Aw.
- Introducing what?

479
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,940
Ah, still playing dumb.

480
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,510
- Hey.
- What?

481
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,620
If you refuse to say it, then Tonic, teach him good.

482
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,790
- What?
- Let me see.

483
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,150
- Oh!
- Hey.

484
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,640
Woah.

485
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,360
You guys are this sweet,

486
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,780
how can it say otherwise?

487
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,950
- You still don't give in.
- How?

488
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,770
It's just a pic, there's nothing to it.

489
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,290
Oh, you chose this yourself. Then what if it's...

490
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,890
this picture?

491
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,500
Hey, Charlie!

492
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,050
I said don't post it.

493
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,890
Well, you said not to post on your phone,
but this is mine, so I can post it.

494
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,440
Well, he has a point.

495
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,690
When you're caught off guard, you're so cute.

496
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,640
So sweet, baby.

497
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,040
What's wrong with you guys?

498
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,900
You don't have to worry, my account is private.

499
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,340
There are only a few people.

500
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,540
But it has him.

501
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,540
if North knows the whole world knows.

502
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,250
Sorry I'm late.

503
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,540
- Oh, Jeff.
- Jeff.

504
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,980
Hey,

505
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,470
Can you be clear to me what's going on between

506
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,850
your brother and my Pit Babe?

507
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,470
Tell us, tell us...

508
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
- Tell us.
- Come on.

509
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,660
What? There's nothing.

510
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
He's shy.

511
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,030
Babe, so what is it?

512
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,010
We are couple now.

513
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,140
Aw, let's cheers.

514
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,030
- Let's cheers, come on.
- This one.

515
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,600
This one better, Oh, it's spilling.

516
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,190
I'll leave it to you, Charlie.

517
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,270
Even though sometimes he can be stubborn, foul- mouthed,

518
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,040
headstrong, cruel and act like a total jerk.

519
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,370
- Oh god.
- Geez.

520
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,830
Oh wow.

521
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,960
But until he regains his faith in love

522
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,810
and even reveals that they are lovers,

523
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,290
I don't know how long I've been waiting for this day.

524
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Congrats.

525
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,000
Thank you, Alan.

526
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,000
Too damn cheesy, uncle.

527
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,150
Someone like you need someone like Charlie to stay in control.

528
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,360
But let me tell you, you guys can be
together but don't jeopardize your work.

529
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,230
If it affects your work, I will scalp you and fire both of you.

530
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,770
Oh, so fierce.

531
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,990
Come, let's give a toast.

532
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,680
- Oh.
- Come on.

533
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,370
- Each one takes a glass.
- Come on.

534
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,960
Kid, can you take it?

535
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,370
- Just one shot.
- Fine.

536
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,320
- Okay.
- Please raise your glass.

537
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,890
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

538
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,930
To Babe and Charlie.

539
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,340
- Whoo!
- Down it. Down it.

540
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,990
Why do you hold it? chuck it down, one shot.

541
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,620
It flows down my throat.

542
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,770
Bum a smoke.

543
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,490
Why don't you celebrate with your new lover? why are you following me out?

544
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,880
I know you don't like Charlie because you don't trust him.

545
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,000
But can't you just open your heart and get to know him?

546
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,620
Please give him a chance.

547
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,030
He wants to get to know you.

548
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,740
And why do you care?

549
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,420
Whether I'm like him or not.

550
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,670
Way, you're my only best friend.

551
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,030
If my friend and my boyfriend have a conflict, what should I do?

552
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,300
I don't know what thoughts Charlie put into your head

553
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,120
or deceiving you about something.

554
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,390
But as far as I know,

555
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,940
since you've met Charlie,

556
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,620
you've changed.

557
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,210
How have I changed?

558
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,350
Can't you see that our team is in trouble?

559
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,300
Dean and Alan fought,

560
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,240
and now you want to fight me.

561
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,160
I don't want to fight you at all.

562
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,720
But when you got me to talk about this, you always look for a fight.

563
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,360
Way, when will you understand me?

564
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,390
I like Charlie.

565
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,010
And I love him so much.

566
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,810
If I'm going to date someone do I have to ask for your permission?

567
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,300
Then can I stop you?

568
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Way.

569
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,440
You know that those are just excuses.

570
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,530
You knew that everything that happened had nothing to do with Charlie.

571
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,910
But it's just you not accepting him.

572
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,710
Who exactly doesn't accepting it?

573
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,820
Is it me or you?

574
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,030
You really don't know?

575
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:27,520
For all this time that I stayed by your side

576
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,690
no matter what shit you're going through.

577
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,450
You really don't know how I feel?

578
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,890
Way, I know.

579
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,680
I know everything and I'm really glad to have you by my side.

580
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:50,090
- But for Charlie...
- But you never cared how I felt.

581
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,370
Just me staying by your side is enough, right?

582
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,560
I once thought,

583
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,730
that if I'm patient enough,

584
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,000
someday you'll probably turn to me,

585
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,070
but today I was so damn wrong.

586
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,260
Time doesn't help a damn thing.

587
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,120
You and Charlie have known each other for less than a year,

588
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,650
and you've made him more important than me.

589
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,550
Please, Way.

590
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,250
After all, you're my only friend.

591
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,910
And you are no less important than anyone, do you understand?

592
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,900
Way.

593
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,970
Way.

594
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,610
Okay, Way, I screwed it all up.

595
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Here.

596
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,710
Thanks.

597
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,710
Babe, come here.

598
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,350
There's something on you face.

599
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,110
All done.

600
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,170
It's a chicken's heart.

601
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,340
- Huh?
- It's a chicken's heart.

602
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,520
No, just no.

603
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,240
Once you enter the curve, then...

604
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,280
You want to be a racer, but you don't want to win?

605
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,530
Because I don't want to beat you.

606
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,290
When there are 2 spots in 1st place, only then I going to want to beat you.

607
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,800
Is it possible?

608
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,880
Right now I'm only losing to a king of
the race track, and it's alright though.

609
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,350
Can I have your necklace?

610
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,150
What?

611
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,590
This necklace?

612
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,740
Yeah.

613
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Well,

614
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,540
I want to keep it as a good luck charm.

615
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,030
If there's an amulet from Pit Babe,

616
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,640
then one day I might be able to move a little closer to you.

617
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,540
Okay.

618
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,960
This is starting to get more and more dangerous.
You know that I never failed what I saw.

619
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,010
It's not too late to withdraw now.

620
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,140
You don't think I'm flirting with you, right?

621
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,670
I love you!

622
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,790
That's right, I really know Tony.

623
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,140
Don't cry anymore.

624
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,900
I'm here now.

625
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,820
So does this mean we're back together?

626
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,990
But you don't have to go this far, do you?

627
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,160
He might die.

628
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,840
I'm not going to let him die.

629
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,640
He's worth a lot more than you think.

630
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,380
It's hot.

631
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,260
I'm not afraid of the heat, but it's the sun.

632
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,810
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

633
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,520
It's all fall down.

634
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,270
I don't feel hot at all.

635
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,600
- Chill.
- So chill.

636
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,360
In the past ten years,

637
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,130
Today is the hottest day yet.

638
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,800
Please let us shoot for a while,

639
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,410
(Talking with imaginary friend.)
Just five minutes.

640
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,480
(Stick lemongrass to repel the rain.)
Come on, come on.

641
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:08,660
Hey, cut.

642
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,530
- Too late.
- Go inside now.

643
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,990
(Previously)

644
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,450
(Is it because you planted lemongrass?)

645
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,610
Pff, How's that?

646
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,530
(Proud of his tricks)
