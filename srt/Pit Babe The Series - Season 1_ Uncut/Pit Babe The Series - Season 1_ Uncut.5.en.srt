1
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,210
Querify competitions are both won and lost.

2
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,530
But it's only a ranking.

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,460
This isn't even a real race.

4
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,020
Tomorrow everyone will see,

5
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,750
that the Hallow has only one King is Pit Babe.

6
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,570
That's not good at all.
The car can still be faster than this.

7
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,330
Alan tuned it for me again.

8
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,920
Wait, guys in the racetrack seems to be something strange going on.

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,060
Pit Babe's car seems to have some problems.

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Alan, what's wrong with Babe's car?

11
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,640
Babe, what happened?

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,410
-Babe!
-Can't get in here.

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
Babe!

14
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
Babe!

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Help!

16
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,820
Help!

17
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Babe!

18
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
Babe!

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,280
Please help, anyone please help.

20
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,530
Babe!

21
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,329
Babe!

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Babe!

23
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,210
Babe!

24
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,820
Babe.

25
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Babe!

26
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,030
Babe Babe!

27
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,610
Babe!

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,730
Yes, nurse, please help lift the patient to change beds.

29
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,529
I'm going to slide the board out.

30
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,690
-Go left and count 1 2 3.
-Be careful of the patient's legs.

31
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,070
-Please be patient.
-Be patient.

32
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,100
-It hurts a little.
-Be patient.

33
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,590
Babe!

34
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,780
How are your symptoms?

35
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,280
Babe, how are you?

36
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll help you.

37
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,360
Is it still painful anywhere?

38
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,010
The car hit with such force. How can I not be hurt?

39
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,070
Still speaking like this makes me feel comfortable.

40
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,870
Alan, who finished the race in first place?

41
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,790
Who could it be but Kim?

42
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,600
But you don't have to worry, I'll get revenge for sure.

44
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,060
It probably won't be that easy, Babe.

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
So why do you make it difficult?

46
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,230
After removing the splint, it does not
mean that you will be able to walk normally.

47
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,270
You have to do physical therapy.

48
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,170
And I think...

49
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,800
you should probably break the rest of the season.

50
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,870
Huh!

51
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,910
Take a break for the whole season?

52
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,100
If I brake, who will race?

53
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,020
It must be Way.

54
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,260
Don't you trust him?

55
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,670
It's not distrust.

56
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,860
Meaning our team has 1, they have 2.

57
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,800
So how can Way handle it?

58
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,320
If there was me, I could still block them and let Way take the lead.

59
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,730
I think this game works better.

60
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,610
I don't think you need to worry about racing right now.

61
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,630
Now your health is most important.

62
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,250
If you force yourself when you're not ready,

63
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,090
it'll only get worse.

64
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,450
Babe, have you eaten yet?

65
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:58,350
And if you force it and your legs
can't be used like before, what do you do?

66
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,640
It ain't worth it

67
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,340
There's still next season, now you have to rest first.

68
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,410
Trust me.

69
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,260
-Let's eat.
-Annoying.

70
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,910
I think you should rest first.

71
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,560
You're an Alpha, aren't you?

72
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,590
Your body may recover faster than others.

73
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,830
If your symptoms improve,

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,730
then come talk to me about racing again.

75
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Okay?

76
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,650
Let's go.

77
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
Stop!

78
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,960
-Babe.
-Get out.

79
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,590
Get out.

80
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,290
I will go when you get better.

81
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,900
Whether I'm okay or not is none of your business.

82
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,340
Why wouldn't it be about me?

83
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,160
I just saw you hurt on the field and I was really worried.

84
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,360
It's good to bring that up.

85
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
I haven't dealt with you yet.

86
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,970
How did you think of that?

87
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,090
My car accident, that's it, I'm okay.

88
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,890
Car has safety.

89
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,650
I also have a fire protection suite .

90
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,060
But you run down without safety, are you crazy?

91
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,880
At that time,

92
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,409
all I thought was

93
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,409
I was worried about you.

94
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,770
Later, don't do that again.

95
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,140
Why?

96
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,420
You're worried about me?

97
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,330
I'm not worried but it looks stupid.

98
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,410
You leave, I'm drowsy.

99
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,130
No, you go.

100
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,240
Go away.

101
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,480
If Babe were to recover in time, would you let him race?

102
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,250
Are you crazy?

103
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,070
Even though he was an Alpha,he had an accident like this.

104
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,919
I don't think he'll recover in time for this season.

105
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,860
Why must such an unfortunate thing happen to our team?

106
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,250
Come on,

107
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,520
no one wants that to happen.

108
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,450
And do you think this was just an accident?

109
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,060
What do you mean?

110
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,180
Come on.

111
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,970
In the next match, Winner is the champion.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,950
-Of course.
-Bottoms up!

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,570
-Let's make a toast!
-Make a toast.

114
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,490
Hey!

115
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,100
People who like to break the mood are here.

116
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,690
I've already told you, right?

117
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,010
That I don't want to win in this way.

118
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,190
How many times have I told you and have you ever listened?

119
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,700
How many times have I told you?

120
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,540
Babe's car accident isn't about me.

121
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,640
And I don't know who did it.

122
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,200
If I knew, I would bow down to him.

123
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,750
And I'll tell the person who did it.

124
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,800
Next time please do it harder.

125
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,240
Besides you, who could possibly

126
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,260
hate Babe that much?

127
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,320
People who talk like that are hated by everyone.

128
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,110
If you're really good, you can ask him yourself.

129
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,100
Maybe it was someone on his team

130
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,960
who did it.

131
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,950
Then you stop bothering me.

132
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,600
Jeff, what did you do to Babe's car?

133
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,380
I didn't do anything.

134
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,270
Everyone saw it all over the field.

135
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,860
That Babe's car accident was because the car had a problem.

136
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,590
Nothing was hit.

137
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,630
There are only a few people in our team who have access to a Babe car.

138
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,690
So why me?

139
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,630
There are many technicians in the team.

140
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,430
Because you came in last and were most suspicious.

141
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,030
I think you might be too biased.

142
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,660
If you think that the people who approach Babe's car

143
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,700
are the ones causing the car's problems.

144
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,650
If so, everyone here,

145
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,150
including you, are suspects.

146
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,010
Way!

147
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,370
-Enough.
-Will you still take his side?

148
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,570
I didn't take sides.

149
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,250
But what Jeff said was right.

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,960
Jeff isn't the only one who has access to Babe's car.

151
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,670
That's right, Way.

152
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,600
I think you should calm down.

153
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,190
Let's check to make it clear first.

154
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,100
That you guys won't believe me.

155
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,970
Do we have to wait for something worse to happen?

156
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,310
It's not that we don't believe you.

157
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,420
But we can't do it without evidence.

158
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,810
What if I have evidence?

159
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,380
I think this might be evidence that Jeff is there.

160
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,000
The evidence is so clear, is there something you want to make up?

161
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,040
I didn't do anything wrong

162
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,360
I just tuned the car for Babe.

163
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,720
If you didn't do anything wrong,
why did you have to do it secretly at night?

164
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,920
I just got a new method and don't
want to waste time because the race is close.

165
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,860
Enough, Way.

166
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,670
Uncle, I didn't do it.

167
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you have proof that you did not do it?

168
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,520
Just words can't be trusted.

169
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,400
Okay, now you've packed your things and left the garage first.

170
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,890
I told you I didn't do it.

171
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,840
Didn't you hear what I said?

172
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,920
Who sent you here?

173
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,590
You're a spy for Red Racing, right?

174
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,310
I swear I didn't do it.

175
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,470
You can let me out of the garage.

176
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,540
But I won't admit guilt for things I didn't do.

177
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
And uncle,

178
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,660
if you don't trust me,

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,420
don't say I'm your brother.

180
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,960
Jeff isn't a Red Racing spy.

181
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,460
Do you side with him?

182
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
That's right.

183
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,080
Me and Jeff are brothers.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Jeff is my brother.

185
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,650
Huh?

186
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,900
Younger brother?

187
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,730
What are the two of you talking about?

188
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,000
Me and Jeff are brothers.

189
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,700
Even though we have different bloodlines

190
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,090
But we were raised and grown up together.

191
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,370
Jeff was the only family I had.

192
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,390
I assure you that Jeff

193
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,320
had no involvement in Babe's car accident.

194
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,760
You guys are siblings, why didn't you say that from the beginning?

195
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,089
This is how it was intended to be hidden.

196
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,780
If I said that I was Charlie's brother.

197
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,060
You would think that I used my connections to get into this team.

198
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,910
You probably look down on my skills.

199
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,390
And wouldn't let me test it.

200
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,960
Although I wanted to intern here

201
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,130
because I wanted to work with the X-Hunter team.

202
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,830
So what?

203
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,400
So what is it like?

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,860
Dean's evidence was already this strong.

205
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,370
What will you deny?

206
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,880
Or are you colluding with him?

207
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,410
Someone secretly modified Babe's car like everyone thought.

208
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,090
It's just that person wasn't Jeff.

209
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,570
It must have been an outsider who snuck into the pit.

210
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,950
If this were the case, Jeff would be cleared of being a suspect, right?

211
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,700
Jeff, wait.

212
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,260
Jeff, Jeff, hold on.

213
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,450
Jeff, Jeff, hold on, Jeff.

214
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,610
Let them apologize first.

215
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,630
It doesn't matter.

216
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,810
Let me leave the garage. That's right.

217
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,440
Everyone doesn't trust me.

218
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,930
I can't continue working here.

219
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,910
Wait a minute.

220
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,720
But Dean's clip really makes it seem suspicious.

221
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,660
Even if Babe had an accident, everyone would be angry.

222
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,370
Including me.

223
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,180
I just pulled out the ECU box and tuned it.

224
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,130
Every mechanic does this.

225
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,270
But Dean and Way just don't like mechanics like me.

226
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll tell them to apologize to you.

227
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,270
But to be honest, Jeff.

228
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,090
It's half of you's fault.

229
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,480
Because in the past you have acted suspiciously.

230
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,300
When you come to work, act quietly and don't keep company with anyone.

231
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,660
At the garage you talked only with Charlie.

232
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,880
It's not strange

233
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
that others will not rely on or trust you.

234
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,930
Sometimes you have to know, Jeff,

235
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
that you don't care about anyone.

236
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,590
Do you like to do things alone, not involved with anyone?

237
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,020
And do you expect others to understand?

238
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,810
Is that possible?

239
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,270
Does that mean I'm wrong?

240
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,050
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,120
It's not like that, Jeff.

242
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,340
Never mind!

243
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,530
You don't have to say anything.

244
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,380
The problem lies with me.

245
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,120
Today I will go back and rest.

246
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,020
Then I'll come back and pack up my stuff.

247
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,850
Jeff, Jeff, hold on.

248
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,270
Well, raise your head a little.

249
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,940
If your back hurts, don't complain to me.

250
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,700
Just finished the race, why don't you go home and sleep?

251
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,800
If I go home and sleep, who will take care of you?

252
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,920
Isn't it better to have me with you?

253
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,500
It was good.

254
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,800
But I'm considerate of you.

255
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,690
Hey Babe.

256
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,940
How many years have you known me?

257
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,400
If you were considerate of me, you would have thought of this long ago.

258
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,640
Yep!

259
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,280
It's true.

260
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,030
Then I won't be considerate of you.

261
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,800
Then please come massage my legs.

262
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,940
-Quit freaking bugging me.
-Oops!

263
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,210
I'm sick.

264
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,940
As strong as this is, it will soon be better.

265
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,580
And how is it at the garage today?

266
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,930
There were many things that happened.

267
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,230
So,

268
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,150
did you know that your boy Charlie is Jeff's older brother?

269
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,360
Huh?

270
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,480
Charlie?

271
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,030
Is he hiding this from you?

272
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,810
He just told the people at the garage
that they were brothers who grew up together.

273
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,150
Then the two people that Jeff likes to do with Charlie is...

274
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,140
Is it because of this?

275
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,160
Babe, are you still going to understand him?

276
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,060
Even though you are the closest to him, he still hides it.

277
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm being honest.

278
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,290
If he can hide that from you, then he can lie to you about other things.

279
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,470
You should only trust Alan and me for now.

280
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,330
I know.

281
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,670
No one cares about me like you do.

282
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,150
You know that I...

283
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,590
I am drowsy and want to sleep.

284
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,350
Have a good dream.

285
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,830
Hmm.

286
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Huh?

287
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,080
You can get mad and tell me to go home.

288
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,310
But wait until you remove the splint, okay?

289
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,120
You have such difficulty moving, how can you take care of yourself?

290
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,700
Could you please not be stubborn?

291
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,630
I'm not stubborn, I'm just hungry.

292
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
I'll go get something to eat.

293
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,500
You don't need to, there's almost nothing in your refrigerator.

294
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,400
Why don't you take care of yourself?

295
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,300
If you don't have me, you'll starve to death.

296
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
You go take a seat first.

297
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,650
I'll take you there.

298
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Go!

299
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,780
You wait a moment and I'll cook for you.

300
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,050
I have prepared food for you.

301
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,370
The taste is not spicy, mild flavor.

302
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,090
It's suitable for sick people like you.

303
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,390
Do you usually cook your own food?

304
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,560
Or do you cook for Jeff?

305
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,740
Normally, I don't cook much.

306
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,170
The food that I cook for you

307
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,290
was found recipe on the internet.

308
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
So?

309
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,260
I thought you had to cook for your brother.

310
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,690
You know this already?

311
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,880
News so fast.

312
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,490
So you don't like that I'm Jeff's brother?

313
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,350
I don't have anything.

314
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,600
Just wondering why you two have to hide these things.

315
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,140
It's like you guys are manipulating other people.

316
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,340
Do you understand?

317
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,690
I just don't think everyone wants to know.

318
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,930
By the way, Jeff is the one who asked me not to tell.

319
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,390
Otherwise, why would I hide you?

320
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,280
How dare Babe's Boy keep secrets from Babe?

321
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,370
But I don't know

322
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,450
if I'll still be a Babe's boy now.

323
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,860
You suddenly don't want me,

324
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,960
even though it's just a misunderstanding.

325
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,740
I haven't done anything wrong.

326
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,560
You're still injured.

327
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,930
Don't move too much.

328
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,530
I'm worried.

329
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,240
I don't need to move much.

330
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,300
If so, let me move instead.

331
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,790
Red Racing doesn't care about other teams.

332
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,020
They only used techniques to block Babe.

333
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,660
Since Kim joined the team

334
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,200
taking the lead or overtaking in a curve has become more difficult.

335
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,870
In the next match, Babe still can't race.

336
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,350
It's just temporary.

337
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,570
Trust me, you'll get better.

338
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,400
Be patient, if you push too hard it will make things worse.

339
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm not upset that I didn't race.

340
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,930
But the point is, I don't want Red Racing to win.

341
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,480
It's like our team was insulted.

342
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,910
That's the point.

343
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,010
Now, our team has only Way who can race.

344
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,690
We would have to talk about the racing plan and completely new techniques.

345
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,150
Champion this year.

346
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,750
We must only place our hope in Way.

347
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,300
I understand you're stressed.

348
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,450
-But...
-It's okay.

349
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,380
Even though my skills are not as good as Babe's,

350
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,000
I will try my best.

351
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,010
Way, I'm sorry.

352
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,940
I leave it to you.

353
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,860
Charlie!

354
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Yes!

355
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,410
Please come and help me.

356
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,480
I'll go home.

357
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,380
Please take care of Babe.

358
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,630
-I'll go.
-Yes.

359
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,240
-I'll take you there.
-See you later.

360
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,760
-Bye bye.
-Hmm.

361
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,380
Why did you come to our garage?

362
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,920
If you're going to bother us, just go back.

363
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,450
We don't have time to play.

364
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,090
Are you worried about me?

365
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,370
What the fuck are you worried about?

366
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,510
You'll probably be happy.

367
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,970
I'm not happy at all.

368
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,300
I look forward to racing with you every day.

369
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,110
But when you get hurt like this,

370
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,540
it's like I'm wasting my time.

371
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,730
Your team is not good.

372
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,910
How could you let something like this happen to your car?

373
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,400
If I met a heedless team like this,

374
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,290
I would probably take action.

375
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,370
I probably don't need other teams' drivers to worry about me.

376
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,830
My team hasn't had any problems.

377
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,970
It's a problem because there are outsiders trickling in.

378
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,510
You should know who's good at things like this.

379
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,760
People like me have enough dignity,

380
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,710
no one would do such dirty things.

381
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,020
Even if you don't dare to do it yourself,

382
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,650
borrowing someone else's hand to do it is just as badass.

383
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,020
What does it mean?

384
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,990
Winner confirmed that he didn't do it.

385
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,370
Winner, everyone knows that he's only good with his mouth.

386
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,530
Maybe that bastard Tony.

387
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,660
You probably don't know what an old dog like him can do, right?

388
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes, Alan.

389
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,870
Jeff came in?

390
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Yes, he came in this morning but he went back in just a moment.

391
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,440
He came to pack all the stuff.

392
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,430
Thank you.

393
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,810
Earlier, a man wearing glasses had already taken the clip.

394
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,679
Is there a camera from another angle that can capture this person?

395
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,620
We don't have it.

396
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,040
He walked away from every camera that could capture it all.

397
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,820
It's like he knows where the cameras are.

398
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,480
I've seen the news.

399
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,270
Your team is in trouble.

400
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,730
A top racer with an injury like that

401
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,210
may not be able to race next round.

402
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,520
How do you think of solving the game?

403
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,190
Babe may be injured and unable to race.

404
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,520
But our team still has A-list racers.

405
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,360
Here.

406
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,430
Way.

407
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,640
They are the same racer as Babe and trained together.

408
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,970
Hello Mr. Pete.

409
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,290
Pleased to meet you.

410
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,380
Hello!

411
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,610
I'm entrusting you to take care of the benefits of the Beyond Group.

412
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,070
Yes!

413
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,730
No matter what, I do my best.

414
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,190
What about the car that had an accident?

415
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,580
Do you know the cause?

416
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,230
At this time, the culprit still cannot be found.

417
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,360
But I can guess what caused it.

418
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,250
At first I was worried that your team would have a mole

419
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,550
but you don't know.

420
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,860
Please be careful.

421
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,520
Guess the people who do it won't stop easily.

422
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,050
I'm worried about that too.

423
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,770
Well, I'll buy some time for you, Alan.

424
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,170
At least I'll keep him busy with other things

425
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,820
and not have time to support the Red Racing team for a while.

426
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,230
Hey, how did you know I like this brand?

427
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,870
I've never told anyone before.

428
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,460
Why don't I know?

429
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,620
Because I'm a Babe's boy.

430
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,160
Does that mean you secretly used it all up?

431
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,670
I just bought a tube earlier and this tube is gone again.

432
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,400
When I use it, it's refreshing.

433
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,820
So, is it really refreshing?

434
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,530
Then later on I'll buy a lot to stock up on.

435
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,960
Uh, okay.

436
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,320
You can go out and I'll take a shower.

437
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,620
How about the things I ordered you to do?

438
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,890
He refused.

439
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,460
Refuse? How is that possible?

440
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,310
Aren't we always lobbying with this person every time there's an auction?

441
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,950
Or did they change someone to manage this time?

442
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,780
Still the same person.

443
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,800
But this time he informed us that it wasn't just us who offered the money.

444
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,450
Beyond Group offered quite a bit of money.

445
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,310
I think it will be difficult to lobby this time.

446
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,170
And did he tell you how much he wanted?

447
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,470
Three times more than last time

448
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,110
But I'm afraid we won't be able to find that much cash in time.

449
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,650
So freeze the funds of Red Racing team.

450
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,030
Then transfer the money to him

451
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,020
But sir, this is the time to decide the champion.

452
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Why do you care?

453
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,720
I don't care about that shitty championship.

454
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,090
After all, racing teams

455
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,960
don't make me as much money as Duty Free.

456
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,130
You do as I say.

457
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Yes!

458
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,870
And one more thing.

459
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,350
I don't like anyone bothering me about my source income.

460
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,440
Please keep it out of my sight.

461
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,410
Yes.

462
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,300
Mr. Pete.

463
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,710
I have contacted our police.

464
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,270
About the person who caused trouble with Pit Babe's car.

465
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,420
He said

466
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,840
that they suddenly disappeared without a trace.

467
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,560
Like professionals.

468
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,810
It's not surprising.

469
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,250
So, do you want me to continue?

470
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,350
I'm not even sure if we'll get them.

471
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Don't have to.

472
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,590
Just by this, it was clear that it was definitely Tony.

473
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,780
We will take revenge on him with an auction.

474
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,380
It seems like you

475
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,550
have a personal grudge against Mr. Tony.

476
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,670
The past that cannot be overcome,

477
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,030
the only way is to come back and finish clearing it up.

478
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,740
Tony and I have a lot of stories from the past.

479
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Yes.

480
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,450
All right, then you go back.

481
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,270
Please tell Tony's subordinates sitting in the back.

482
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,200
That you don't have to come watch over me.

483
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,590
If they really want to know anything,

484
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,800
then let their boss talk to me.

485
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,270
Okay.

486
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,410
Wait a minute!

487
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,560
Don't hurry.

488
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,240
You recently removed the splint.

489
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,610
I'm bored so I want to practice walking.

490
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,210
During this time you called me first.

491
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,490
It won't be good if the pain increases.

492
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,750
So when did you come here?

493
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,710
I'm not going anywhere.

494
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,070
Last night I slept over here.

495
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,250
No, I mean when you came to hold me. When?

496
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,330
Why can't my senses detect you coming?

497
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,230
Go ahead!

498
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,300
Babe!

499
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,350
Does it hurt?

500
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,780
Why don't I feel anything?

501
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,000
Where has my sense gone?

502
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,030
Don't worry, it's probably because you just recovered from an injury.

503
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,010
I think if your body recovers

504
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,040
those abilities will probably come back.

505
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,450
What?

506
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,980
Are you saying that all your senses are gone?

507
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,390
That's right.

508
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,180
Both vision

509
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,570
and sound.

510
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,310
Even now, I can't even distinguish the Alpha scent.

511
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,870
Don't tell Way yet that my senses have disappeared.

512
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,380
I want him to focus on racing.

513
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,090
Okay.

514
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,360
Babe you came just in time for me to finish cooking.

515
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,400
Babe, are you still stressed about your senses?

516
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,340
I'm just stressed out that I don't know what's wrong with my body.

517
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,900
It just doesn't feel the same.

518
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,260
Are you afraid you'll become just an ordinary person?

519
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,550
I just don't know if I'd be worth it if I became an ordinary person.

520
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,260
Babe.

521
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,370
Even if you have no special sense or nothing at all.

522
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,800
You will always be special to me.

523
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,550
What would you say if I asked to run the rest of the season in your place?

524
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,880
You?

525
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Yeah!

526
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,520
I've gone to think about it.

527
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,910
If you were to lose your championship title to someone

528
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,860
It would be better if that position belonged to Babe's boy.

529
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,530
Do you know what you're saying?

530
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,370
It's not as easy as when you practice with me at the track, Charlie.

531
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,180
Even if I don't win the championship,

532
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,780
I didn't let the Red Racing team win easily.

533
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,010
All right!

534
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,090
If you're going to race in my place

535
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,070
You have to train 10 times harder.

536
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,520
I'm ready.

537
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,460
Shift.

538
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,240
Shift, that's good.

539
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,350
Shift.

540
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,750
Keep the left side. Keep the left side.

541
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,460
Charlie, what are you doing?

542
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,180
Babe, I'm sorry.

543
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,180
So you want to race in my place?

544
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,950
I'm asking if you want to race in my place.

545
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,190
I want it.

546
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,110
Then don't apologize to me.

547
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,480
You just have to do it.

548
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,520
Next, shift down, shift down, not up.

549
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,770
Everything is the same.

550
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,010
What are you going to do?

551
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,390
I see that your wound is nearly dry.

552
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,250
Apply some or it will leave a scar.

553
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,490
You're lovely.

554
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,450
If I’m lovely, then please love me a lot

555
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,810
and less scolding.

556
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,860
You have a lot of guts lately, Charlie.

557
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,760
It's because your cheeks are kissable.

558
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,510
Why? you look like a confused puppy.

559
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,340
Just surprised, I didn't think you could eat at a food stall like this.

560
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,550
I wasn’t born rich and ate luxuriously every meal,

561
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,770
I can eat at ordinary restaurants.

562
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,020
I've been eating at this stall since I was training with Alan.

563
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,490
I always came to this aunty for food.

564
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,590
And since when did you join Alan's team?

565
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,280
I thought you said you know everything about me?

566
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,910
Aren't you a fan?

567
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,240
Don't tell me you lied to me.

568
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,780
Some things,

569
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,340
searching on the internet aren't as sure as asking them personally, right?

570
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,460
I just want you to tell me.

571
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,190
That time, I was 18 when I left the Chen family home.

572
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,340
-Are you still recruiting the mechanics?
-So what can you do?

573
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,890
I can't do anything.

574
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,690
Well, just cleaned the wheels. The cleanser and the sponge are over there.

575
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,940
Okay.

576
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,800
-Enough, that's it.
-Alright.

577
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,470
-Alright, go.
-You can go.

578
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,560
-Come on, let's go eat.
-Let's go.

579
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
Come on, let's eat.

580
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,390
Woah...

581
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,730
I'm sorry.

582
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
It's okay.

583
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,460
Well? You want to be racer?

584
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:20,970
That's right.

585
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,400
Try starting the engine.

586
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,070
Would it be alright?

587
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,480
Come on, try it, the three buttons over there.

588
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,210
-These?
-Yeah.

589
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,230
Since then,

590
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,010
I’ve practiced like that every day and night,

591
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,720
Never stop.

592
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,260
My only goal is that...

593
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,620
I must be Number one.

594
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,920
No matter how tough it is, I can do everything.

595
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,730
Coming, coming now.

596
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,750
Here.

597
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,260
Thank you.

598
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,670
Why are you staring?

599
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,240
Because you're great.

600
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,240
To this day, I still see you practicing hard.

601
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,590
You're really awesome.

602
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,250
If you want to be a champion, you have to practice hard.

603
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,250
But it doesn't have to be that hard.

604
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,370
Even if you don't compete this season,

605
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,960
You are still at the top of the industry.

606
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,020
You don't get it, Charlie.

607
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,440
I can't lose the first place.

608
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,530
Because if I'm not the champion.

609
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,530
Then I have nothing left.

610
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,100
I understand.

611
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,780
I also grew up alone.

612
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:25,380
Please know that, now,

613
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm here beside you.

614
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,230
And I don't want you to think that there's only you in this world.

615
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,970
Aren't you too cute, huh?

616
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,570
Eat your food.

617
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,180
I know.

618
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,570
Eat it.

619
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,020
Everyone probably knows the situation of our team.

620
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,860
Now at The Hollows, we only have one racer left.

621
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,090
That is Way.

622
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,020
But we’re constantly attacked by their line-blocking plans.

623
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,010
Then what now? No matter how good Way is,

624
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,910
If encounter something like this, it's hard.

625
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,920
That's why I called everyone to a meeting today.

626
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,030
I'll push one of you up to race in the senior division in this program.

627
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,720
What do you all think?

628
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,000
Us? Will it be okay?

629
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,960
Even in the small division, I still haven't won.

630
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,350
That's right, and to come in the middle of the season like this,

631
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,640
We are clearly the plus ones.

632
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,930
I just want to fix that team's game.

633
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,850
At least you guys could pull the defenders from that team,

634
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,490
then Way will be able to do things easily.

635
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,840
What do you guys think?

636
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,620
I will race.

637
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,960
Are you sure?

638
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,290
Yes, I'm sure.

639
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,920
As long as I get to race in The Hollows, I can do anything.

640
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,670
If no one has any objections, then I'm letting Dean race.

641
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,220
I would like to suggest someone.

642
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,860
Babe.

643
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,260
Why are you here? Why don't you rest at home?

644
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,810
I rested until I was nearly bored to death,

645
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,860
Let me come outside, too.

646
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,980
You’re getting someone to race in my place,
don't you want to consult me first?

647
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,870
Then who do you want? This is all our team has.

648
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,420
You want North or Sonic?

649
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,310
I don't want to bother them, Let them create their content.

650
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,850
If you don't want them, then who will you suggest?

651
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,300
Charlie.

652
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,490
Hey, Babe.

653
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,280
I don't agree with this.

654
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,590
There are many racers on our team.

655
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,270
If you were to choose someone to race
in your place, would it be someone on the team?

656
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,010
Well, if there's someone who will race in my place.

657
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,150
That person must be on the same level as me.

658
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,440
In fact, I believe in you, Dean.

659
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,860
But it would be better if our team had more options.

660
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,610
Alan, what do you think?

661
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,050
I'm okay.

662
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,120
But I couldn't easily let him join the team.

663
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,320
Estimate a braking distance before turning a curve.

664
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,950
And must not ease off the accelerator too quickly.

665
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,060
You can do it, Charlie, you can do it.

666
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,600
What's wrong?

667
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,700
Why don't you go get ready?

668
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,620
I'm going now.

669
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,960
Hands shaking like this, will you be able to control the steering wheel?

670
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,980
I'm sorry.

671
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,990
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

672
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,920
And most importantly, I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

673
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,860
Charlie.

674
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,410
You don't need to worry.

675
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,090
You just drive like you practice with me.

676
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,490
Is this ok?

677
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,130
So you don't trust the trainer?

678
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,110
I trust you.

679
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,880
Because my trainer is the greatest in the world.

680
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,810
Talk nonsense.

681
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,770
Win first.

682
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,250
Do you know what will happen if you lose?

683
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,310
I know.

684
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,000
And if I win, what will you give me?

685
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,530
What are you giving?

686
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,560
Win first and then I'll tell you what to give.

687
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,020
Alright, are you ready?

688
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,850
I'm ready, Alan.

689
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,080
I'm ready.

690
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,390
Good, then get ready.

691
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,650
The rules are simple, whoever crosses the finish line first wins.

692
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,220
If I can beat Charlie I'll get the race instead of Babe, right?

693
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,000
Who said I'm going to let you guys race each other?

694
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,980
The two of you have to race with Babe.

695
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,930
Only those who defeat him will have the right to race in his place.

696
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:28,900
(Next episode preview)

697
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,640
I'm sorry, Babe, that I lost.

698
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:31,750
Wait!

699
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,490
Did I tell you to go back?

700
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,440
From now on, I'm ordering a ban on Dean from

701
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,990
coming to the garage or practice field for one week.

702
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,690
(Kid, I'm sorry.)
You could at least try

703
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,080
opening your heart and really getting to know me.

704
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,430
I don't want you to be a Babe's boy anymore, Charlie.

705
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,460
Way, you're my only close friend.

706
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,540
You really don't know how I feel.

707
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,790
-The weather is good.
-Good weather.

708
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,880
It's about to die of cold.

709
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,920
(Chills)

710
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,340
Kiss first.

711
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,480
(Will you teach me to do this?)

712
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,790
Turn around like this?

713
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,730
(Babe is an expert in this kind of thing.)

714
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,810
(So satisfying.)

715
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,190
(What's that sound?)

716
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,500
(Wireless microphone disconnected)

717
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,330
(Is it Songkran already, Daddy?)

718
