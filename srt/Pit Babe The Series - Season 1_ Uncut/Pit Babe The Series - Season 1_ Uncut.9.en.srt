1
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,820
I just touch

2
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,570
or catch someone else. I will see some future that involves that person.

3
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,010
Touch?

4
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,740
If you want to do something, please stop.

5
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,070
I think the person who should stop is you.

6
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,120
You know that what you did to those children was wrong.

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,820
You're the one who can stop this, Ken.

8
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,650
You've probably forgotten who you're supposed to be loyal to in this house.

9
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,360
I need corroborating evidence against Tony.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,810
Hey!

11
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,130
Get in the car quickly.

12
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,060
Really annoyed.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,200
What are you thinking?

14
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,380
No, nothing.

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,300
Do you still think about what happened a moment ago?

16
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,370
I told you I'm fine.

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,940
I'm fine.

18
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,520
You have a knack for turning big things into small things.

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,270
Things that happened today.

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,790
We almost died.

21
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,230
And today we survived

22
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,910
because we were lucky.

23
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,990
But who knows in the future?

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,180
Will we still have luck?

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,380
And if something like that happened to you,

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,230
how would I feel?

27
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,660
No matter what you say,

28
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,640
in the end I won't leave you.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,590
You still have a chance to turn back, Charlie.

30
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,910
You are the person I have spent my whole life trying to be by your side.

31
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,980
And you want me to leave you like this?

32
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,510
I don't want it.

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,990
Let me be by your side.

34
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,360
You won't regret it, will you, Charlie?

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,150
That day will never come.

36
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,150
What happened to North?

37
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,620
Almost got gangbanged.

38
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,159
It's good that I was able to help in time.

39
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,230
You wanted to help Kim but didn't look at your own.

40
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,730
Suddenly went in like that

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,990
And what about Kim?

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,380
Locked in there.

43
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,960
There were many people locked up in there.

44
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,420
I think this is

45
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,750
international human trafficking.

46
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,630
Did you all go in and see it all?

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,700
In conclusion, tonight, no one needs to return to the garage or go home.

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
Live together at my house.

49
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,130
The more we separate, the more dangerous it is.

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,370
I think so.

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,940
By now Tony probably knows

52
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,240
what we've messed with him.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,300
Take North to get the wound treated first.

54
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,210
And then tomorrow we'll think about what to do next.

55
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,750
-Hmm.
-Let's go.

56
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,980
(Mr. Dong)

57
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,480
You do it slowly.

58
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,940
Is it okay to do it gently?

59
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,280
Why is it such a big deal?
Do you do it yourself?

60
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,620
Hey, how do you say this?

61
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,280
I tried to protect to and help you.

62
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,560
Who asked you to do that?
You suddenly put yourself at risk.

63
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,180
Do you think you're Superman?

64
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,110
What? I didn't think anything of it.

65
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,250
I just want you to survive.

66
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,240
If you do that, you will not survive.

67
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,040
Well, I'm sure.

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,610
What are you sure of?

69
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,640
You got hit hard.
Do you still think you will survive?

70
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,390
You really have a confidence face.

71
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,790
Stay still.

72
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,520
Do it slowly.

73
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,820
Yep!

74
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,850
I'm just sure

75
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,840
you'll come back and help me.

76
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,260
Don't put on a confident face.

77
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,100
The next day,

78
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,200
if it's more difficult,

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,770
I'll go home first.

80
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,150
Oh my, is that so?

81
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,560
Are you really leaving me?

82
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm just kidding,

83
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,620
if I leave you then who will start a YouTube channel?

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,290
If the channel is abandoned, Alan will scold me again.

85
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,140
Here, take it.

86
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,430
You healed the wound yourself.

87
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,310
Hey!

88
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,640
I'd like to talk to you.

89
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,090
Sure.

90
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,360
Jeff doesn't like watching movies, doesn't he?

91
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,940
He probably likes it.

92
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,060
Normally, I see him watching all the time.

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,720
Is that so?

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,340
Or he doesn't want to watch with me.

95
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,409
Is anything up?

96
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,070
You're going to ask Jeff out on a date?

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,550
What's going on, what's the date?

98
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,110
I saw that the movie was new so I invited him to watch it.

99
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,170
I'll go invite the other youngsters in the garage as well.

100
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,780
Alan.

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,480
What?

102
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,710
I'm going to be honest.

103
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,170
Yeah!

104
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,280
I don't mind

105
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,510
if you flirt with my brother.

106
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,480
Wait, let's sit and talk first.

107
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,570
I'm not going to flirt with him.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,980
Is that so?

109
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,130
But if you're really dating,

110
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,800
I don't mind.

111
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,540
Then just ask him out.

112
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,570
Where are you in such a hurry?
Sit down and talk to me first.

113
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,120
It's not that I don't want to ask him out,

114
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,700
but after I did, your brother didn't answer me.

115
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,540
I don't even know what I did wrong.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,180
I LINE him since morning and he hasn't even replied to a single sticker.

117
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,740
The chat room was full of chats on my right side.

118
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,710
When I called, he hung up.

119
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
I don't know what to do.

120
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,960
Sometimes Jeff's like this.

121
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,820
Even when I call, sometimes he doesn't answer.

122
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,880
But when I can contact him, I will tell you immediately.

123
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,420
Is this ok?

124
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,160
Yes!

125
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,160
Is there anything else?

126
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,140
No, you can rest.

127
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,140
Hello Mr. Pisut.

128
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,050
Oh hello sir.

129
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,980
I choose number 04.

130
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,850
Do you like number 04?

131
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,740
You really smartly choose.

132
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,140
Hello Mr. Pete.

133
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,700
Hello.

134
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,070
Are you interested in any children today?

135
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,150
I guarantee that everyone is talented.

136
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,500
How much do all these children cost?

137
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,870
30 Million Baht.

138
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,370
Okay.

139
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,130
Pete,

140
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,550
you asshole!

141
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,890
You've known this all along?

142
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,280
I asked, did you know this all along?

143
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,140
Wait, you misunderstood me.

144
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,650
Yes, I misunderstood you, thought you were a nice person.

145
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,280
Do you do business like this?

146
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,670
Could you please calm down first?

147
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,600
I, like you, went undercover to spy on Tony.

148
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,060
I need evidence to convict him.

149
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,730
You'd rather cooperate with me,

150
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,750
not looking for arguments like this.

151
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,310
Well, you didn't tell me.

152
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,130
You put yourself with human traffickers like this,

153
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,400
who knows?

154
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,730
I have only recently entered this market.

155
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,720
Like wealthy people like Mr. Dong, it's the same.

156
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,810
They pretended to be charitable and adopted orphans.

157
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,540
Finally, they have a plan to sell these special children

158
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,370
to use and make a profit.

159
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,560
And is the millionaire upstairs

160
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,820
a connection to Tony?

161
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,700
I would say yes, but not all.

162
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,710
Tony doesn't really care about these people.

163
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,900
I'm going to be honest, these kids are not grade A.

164
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,530
As long as it sells, Tony will be satisfied.

165
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,810
He will not interfere to cause himself more trouble.

166
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,500
So why is it such a big deal to do alone?

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,590
About this matter, the less people know, the better.

168
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,900
We don't know who Tony's spies are.

169
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,270
You know your Daddy's behavior, don't you?
What kind of person is he?

170
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,400
Let me ask you directly, Pete, who exactly are you?

171
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,050
You're probably not just a millionaire
who wants to take down Tony, are you?

172
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,230
I am just like you.

173
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,370
I was an orphan in the Chen family.

174
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,790
I'm Enigma.

175
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,270
I actually lived in the Chen family's house.

176
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,860
But I left there a long time ago.

177
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,470
The cause is the same as you.

178
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,350
I can't accept calling someone like that "Daddy".

179
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,280
So why didn't you tell me from the beginning that it was Enigma?

180
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,700
I just need time and wait to be fully prepared.

181
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,700
I will come out and attack them.

182
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,130
I think we still have a lot to talk about,
but it wouldn't be appropriate for you to be here right now.

183
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,880
Waiting for the right opportunity, I will tell you again.

184
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,930
Now hurry and get out of here.

185
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,630
There are many people who are Tony's eyes and ears.

186
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,630
-Babe.
-Way.

187
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,370
Why don't you tell me what you're going to do?

188
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,090
I'm okay, you don't have to worry.

189
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,030
I went to meet Pete.

190
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,090
You probably won't believe what I know.

191
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,620
The Enigma that Tony was trying to hide

192
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,270
was Pete.

193
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,030
Hello!

194
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,070
I'm Jeff.

195
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,920
Is this Jeff?

196
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,640
Where have you been?

197
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,110
Daddy took me but now I can escape.

198
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,240
And whose phone number is this?

199
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,590
Now is not the time for you to ask about that.

200
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,610
Charlie, you listen to me.

201
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,460
All you need to know is that Daddy's Enigma is...

202
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,460
I just want you to bring him back to me.

203
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,530
I promise I won't do anything to him.

204
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,810
You are the only Enigma left in our home.

205
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,610
Don't let Daddy down.

206
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,900
Yes, Daddy.

207
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,430
Are you saying

208
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,450
that Mr. Pete, who sponsors our team, is an Enigma?

209
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,370
That's right.

210
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,520
But he had been running away from that house for a long time.

211
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,220
We're so lucky that he's on our side.

212
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,650
He, too, wants to take down Tony.

213
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,250
Wait a minute.

214
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,319
Hello Charlie.

215
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,290
Babe, where are you?

216
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,589
I'm on my way back, don't worry.

217
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,650
I know who Tony's Enigma is.

218
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,250
I just found out.

219
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,170
Mr. Pete.

220
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,350
No, Tony's Enigma is Way.

221
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,010
Stop!

222
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,130
Babe.

223
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,340
Babe. Hey!

224
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,770
Hello Babe.

225
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,070
You don't have to be scared, Babe.

226
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,610
Soon we will be able to go back to living life as usual.

227
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,140
I've talked to Daddy.

228
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,960
You don't have to do anything much.

229
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,890
You just go back and have a family with me.

230
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,740
The only solution for me,

231
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,230
you and everyone.

232
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,210
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

233
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,360
I won't hurt you.

234
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,350
You damn bastard, Way!

235
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,400
Please stop.

236
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,380
Sleep now, Charlie.

237
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,020
Way!

238
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,610
Way!

239
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,960
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

240
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,410
Wake up quickly.

241
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,560
-Charlie wakes up.
-How are you?

242
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,390
Babe.

243
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,710
Don't you call my name.

244
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,740
How dare you do this to me, Way?

245
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,940
But I love you, Babe.

246
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,500
What the hell is love?

247
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,300
In the past,

248
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,890
I thought you were my only friend.

249
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,040
The most important friend that I trust the most.

250
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,320
You took the opportunity to use your opinions
to judge other people and impose them on others.

251
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,830
It's very pathetic.

252
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,030
And if I don't do this, do you have a better way?

253
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,940
Do you have a way to make Tony
stop bothering you, me, and everyone on the team?

254
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,280
I believe this method is the best way.

255
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,520
Just you go back with me.

256
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,150
Just do as Daddy says.

257
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,620
The past troubles will end.

258
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,230
Daddy will stop bothering you

259
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,300
and stop bothering us

260
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,350
You go back with me.

261
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,600
Let me go.

262
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,620
If you still have some common sense

263
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,710
and humanity left in you.

264
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,000
Please get out of my life and don't come back to me.

265
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,430
Let's go, Charlie.

266
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Why you do this to me?

267
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,960
Why are you doing this to me?

268
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,190
Babe.

269
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,410
Charlie.

270
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,710
Why do all the people I love betray me?

271
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,160
Why?

272
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,880
How dare you say that

273
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,100
you failed to do what I ordered?

274
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,050
I'm sorry, Daddy.

275
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,130
How much time did I give you?

276
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,880
I've always tried to believe

277
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,870
that you will succeed

278
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
Now I'm wondering

279
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,980
whose side you're on.

280
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,370
Don't forget that your company,

281
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,410
your condo, every car,

282
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,690
and even the clothes you wear belong to me.

283
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,380
Don't think that your special Enigma

284
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,940
can compete with me.

285
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,160
Want to go back to being a homeless person?

286
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,070
I'm wrong, Daddy.

287
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,500
People like you are useless.
Have you ever accomplished anything?

288
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,760
In car racing, you lose to Babe.

289
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,650
You wanted Babe but lost to Charlie.

290
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,280
I asked you to bring Babe back, but you couldn't do it.

291
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,910
For your Enigma.

292
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,760
If I didn't determine the value.

293
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,760
You are no different from garbage.

294
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,120
Please give me one more chance, Daddy.

295
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,740
The opportunity? It's gone.

296
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,710
I really have a way of dealing with it.

297
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,780
Charlie.

298
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,770
Now Babe's sense is with Charlie.

299
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,440
What does it mean?

300
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,320
Charlie.

301
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,260
When I was fighting Charlie.

302
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,640
I think Babe's Sense goes to Charlie.

303
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,570
Kenta.

304
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,560
Whatever you do,

305
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,530
go get Charlie back as quickly as possible.

306
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,920
Yes.

307
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,230
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,840
Why are you apologizing to me?

309
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,710
I'm sorry that

310
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,130
I should have known about Way sooner.

311
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,380
I can go and protect you.

312
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,410
What if I'd known about Way sooner?

313
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,300
Won't I regret it?

314
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,180
You're still sad.

315
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,120
But you will be able to handle it better.

316
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,610
At least

317
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,830
when you know the truth,

318
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,400
I want you to have me by your side.

319
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,110
What happened last night,

320
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,160
I secretly thought

321
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,290
that I couldn't trust anyone anymore.

322
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,570
I don't dare let anyone come close to me again.

323
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,260
But you have me.

324
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,960
I don't want to be tricked, Charlie.

325
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,640
I've been tricked all my life.

326
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,870
My biological father,

327
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,520
Tony,

328
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,190
and plus there's Way, the person I trust the most in my life.

329
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,580
I will never hurt you.

330
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,490
Can I trust you, Charlie?

331
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,510
By my life.

332
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,340
-North.
-Huh.

333
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,220
You haven't uploaded any clips lately.

334
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,230
Still can't find content.

335
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,440
Last time I thought about it.

336
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,070
-Hey!
-Umm.

337
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,570
Oh, Uncle.

338
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,320
Let's eat some snacks together.

339
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,720
Oh, what's wrong with him?

340
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,740
I don't know.

341
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,220
What's the matter, uncle?

342
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,920
That is,

343
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,470
No, there isn't.

344
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,370
-No.
-What's the matter, uncle?

345
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,260
Say it, say it.

346
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,260
No, that's not good.

347
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,210
Uncle, are you stressed about something?

348
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,570
If you have anything, please tell us.

349
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,200
-What is it about him?
-What?

350
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,790
Looks like he's doing it hard.

351
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,440
Uncle!

352
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,240
Why are you suddenly jumping into the water?

353
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,570
Or have you heard the news about Kim?

354
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,990
It's not.

355
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,500
Uncle, please don't tell me that

356
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,150
Way has come back to take revenge on us.

357
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,880
Damn it, I never thought

358
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,350
that Way couldn't be trusted.

359
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,100
No.

360
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
So what is it?

361
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,210
You just say it.

362
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,180
Why would you be stunned?

363
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,330
Quite right!

364
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,350
Here it is, you guys, take a look.

365
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,280
Chat has only the right side like this.
How can this not make me stressed?

366
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,880
Seriously?

367
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,300
You've been stressed since morning because of "just this".

368
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,350
What is this "just this matter"?

369
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,810
Jeff had just been imprisoned by Tony and had just escaped.

370
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,050
Don't you guys think he's a bit demoralized?

371
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,310
Huh!

372
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,760
He's worried about him like he's in love with younger.

373
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,410
So he was distraught. It's like this.

374
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,540
Yes, I'm worried, but we live together as a family.

375
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,470
Stop referring to familong family.

376
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,780
Let me ask you, if it were me and Sonic, would you react like this?

377
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,110
This is called secretly loving him without clearly knowing.

378
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,320
It's true.

379
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,680
If so, Uncle.

380
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,080
I will teach you.

381
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,490
As I have more experience in love than you.

382
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,010
What?

383
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,930
Oh, uncle.

384
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,410
If you really like him

385
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,600
then stop acting like a senior.

386
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,640
You must do something.

387
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,580
Make a Move, do you understand?

388
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,930
Let's start with...

389
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,630
with...

390
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,590
With what? Just say it.

391
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,470
If you're really worried about him, then go to his room.

392
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,490
Let Jeff know how much you like him.

393
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,750
Oh, will it be good? Will he be uncomfortable?

394
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,150
Uncle, at this moment do you have to score points?

395
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,250
Do you know how they say "I know it's risky but I have to try it"?

396
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,040
But if he doesn't like you, he'll say so.

397
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,900
If you want to love, you have to take risks, uncle.

398
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,830
Yes!

399
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,650
Fighting!

400
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,850
Let's go.

401
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,840
Fighting!

402
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,100
There you go.

403
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,330
-There you go.
-Huh!

404
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,630
Definitely got it.

405
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,690
Uncle.

406
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,800
Uh, what is this?

407
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,690
Oh!

408
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,490
Bua loy with ginger juice, ginseng stewed chicken, gotu kola juice

409
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,750
I didn't know what you wanted to eat so I bought it all.

410
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,270
Thank you, Uncle, but later on you don't have to.

411
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,980
Well, I bought a lot of them and I think you need friends to eat with.

412
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,640
May I go inside?

413
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,330
You asked to come into the room and what are you shy about?

414
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,410
Should I invite Uncle to sit with me?

415
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,030
Hmm.

416
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,060
In fact, you didn't just come to deliver me food, right?

417
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,940
Is there anything at the garage?

418
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,770
There wasn't anything at the garage.

419
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,540
So I'm worried about you.

420
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,110
I see you don't answer the phone or reply any messages.

421
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,260
So I thought what was wrong with you?

422
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:42,429
When I was arrested at Tony's house, my phone was taken by Kenta.

423
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,639
Did he take it?

424
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,969
When I escaped, I only thought that I would survive.

425
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,170
Hey, go!

426
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,470
Just running away and I'd almost die.

427
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,240
I don't have time to go get the phone.

428
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,430
And the message shows as read, who read it?

429
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,170
It's probably Kenta.

430
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,310
Ahh!

431
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,220
So you haven't read it at all?

432
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,170
Why? What did you send?

433
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,280
-Let me have a look.
-Hey!

434
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,240
There's nothing, you don't have to look.

435
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,430
So you escaped like this and they didn't come after you?

436
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,550
It's likely that way, but don't worry.

437
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,710
I'm still useful to Daddy.

438
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,060
At most I would just get caught but probably not die.

439
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,510
Don't make a face like that.

440
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,010
Several things happened last night.

441
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,050
Until I don't know how to join pieces together.

442
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,040
Both about Way and about Babe.

443
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,760
And also about Kim.

444
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,330
You don't have to worry about Kim.

445
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,770
In the future I saw, he was not dead.

446
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,100
But that doesn't mean other people won't die, right?

447
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,430
No matter what happens, kid.

448
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,730
I don't want you to put yourself at risk alone like that again.

449
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,240
The way you sneaked into his house alone without anyone going to help.

450
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,890
It's too dangerous.

451
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,260
If I could choose, I wouldn't want to go back.

452
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,880
But it had no choice.

453
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,790
Why isn't there any other choice?

454
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,220
The next day, we'll consult together.

455
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,180
There are many people who are willing to be relied upon.

456
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,850
Especially me.

457
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,560
Is there anything else I can clean up?

458
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,130
No more.

459
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,390
So

460
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,350
I'll go home.

461
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,700
What, why did you give me your cell phone?

462
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,260
Well, you haven't bought a new phone yet.

463
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,160
Let's use mine first.

464
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,590
So what will you use?

465
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,320
Come on, I really need a new phone.

466
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,860
Just think of it as welfare.

467
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,600
Thank you.

468
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,490
The internships here pay very well.

469
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,200
Can I now call myself Alan's Boy?

470
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,370
What is Alan's Boy?

471
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,250
I'm going home now.

472
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,270
Then you don't have to change your phone number.
This is my number, I remember it.

473
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,700
I'll call to check on how you are, understand?

474
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,820
OK, let's do as you say.

475
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,850
I'm going.

476
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,700
What happened?

477
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,540
I see it again.

478
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,780
You see?

479
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
You see your own story?

480
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,520
I see myself and everyone.

481
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,500
I saw you got kidnapped by Daddy.

482
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,840
And in the end,

483
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
everything bad followed.

484
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,520
No matter how I review it.

485
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,750
Every path returns to the same point.

486
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,570
That is, we all must die.

487
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,650
It's like we can't get away from it.

488
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,450
What's worse than that?

489
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,730
That is, every time I see.

490
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,520
I feel like it's becoming more real.

491
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,590
Bro.

492
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,010
Daddy won't stop.

493
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,510
Daddy still doesn't know the conditions of my senses, right?

494
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,610
That if I die

495
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,610
the special sense I got from Babe will return to its owner.

496
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,210
He shouldn't know.

497
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,110
If so, there might be a way.

498
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,370
But it might be a bit risky.

499
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,650
Bro, the image I saw was that we all died.

500
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,550
What could be more risky than this?

501
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,070
We must give what Daddy wants.

502
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,710
That's

503
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,310
my life.

504
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,730
Are you going crazy?

505
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,800
There's no way.

506
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,830
Hold on, Jeff.

507
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,520
Listen to me first.

508
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,530
Everything probably won't end easily.

509
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,610
You've seen it all, haven't you?

510
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,410
You know there's only one way that works.

511
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,620
Is it really worth your life

512
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,610
in exchange for Babe's life?

513
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,460
If Daddy didn't want to stop,

514
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,660
there would be no other way.

515
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,680
And who said one life is exchanged for one?

516
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,790
You mean...

517
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
That's right, with this plan

518
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,060
both Kim and everyone will survive.

519
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,000
But we have to try not to make anything go wrong.

520
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,750
And most importantly,

521
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,590
this time I must rely on you.

522
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,900
Sir.

523
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,770
What's wrong, Jeff?

524
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,730
You come back here.

525
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,230
Is there something very important?

526
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,480
I don't want Daddy to hurt anyone again.

527
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,500
I want this to end once and for all.

528
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,530
I've never hurt anyone.

529
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,090
Well, your brothers

530
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,670
don't want to come home nicely.

531
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,590
I have taken care of them very well.

532
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,180
But as everyone grew up,

533
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,790
they became strong enough.

534
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,580
No one cares about this father at all.

535
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,830
I was just doing my duty as a father, bringing my son home.

536
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,820
Is that all?

537
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,530
And Kim who was imprisoned and others.

538
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,530
How do you explain?

539
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,750
Even though I liked to please you when you were little,

540
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,440
that doesn't mean you can ask for everything from me.

541
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,280
What if I had a plan to bring Charlie back to this house?

542
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,260
What will you do?

543
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,860
Right now, it's true that Babe's total score is leading.

544
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,780
But he can't race anymore.

545
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,110
If this continues,

546
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,320
Red Racing will definitely overtake us in the points race.

547
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,730
I will race.

548
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,340
You can't, Babe.

549
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,630
You've just recovered, your body isn't ready.

550
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,270
And you still get hurt again.

551
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,030
The more you force yourself to go to the race, the worse it will be.

552
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,660
Charlie.

553
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,060
You don't have to argue with him, Babe.

554
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,570
You should know your body's limits.

555
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,650
But that means X-Hunter won't win.

556
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,340
Well, let it be.

557
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,260
A championship is more important than your life?

558
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,820
I understand the feeling of a king of the field like you.

559
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,460
That it's hard to accept.

560
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,020
But if I had to trade the trophy with your life

561
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,730
I'm not pleased.

562
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,070
You don't have to worry.

563
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,600
Even though I was in last place because I entered in the middle.

564
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,180
But if I block Winner well enough, his score might not overtake you.

565
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,310
It's not like that, Charlie, even if your plan sounds good.

566
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,520
But.

567
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,490
What is it?

568
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,420
But it's hardly true.

569
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,470
You're not the only one racing with Winner.

570
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,050
In the field, there are many others.

571
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,540
Before you could get close to Winner,

572
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,110
I thought you'd be blocked by another car.

573
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,540
Okay, come on.

574
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,280
Just think about doing your best.

575
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,290
Because we can't do anything more than this.

576
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,670
And what if I'm there to help screen?

577
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,500
If there was mine and Charlie's car

578
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,770
This might be good, right?

579
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,660
Hey, Dean.

580
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,200
"I thought you wouldn't come back" right?

581
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,460
North.

582
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,630
At first, when I left, I thought like that.

583
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,920
But now I can think that it was me who wasn't ready.

584
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,070
Racing isn't just about racing techniques.

585
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,280
But it is also a matter of the heart.

586
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,510
At this point, I really gave up on Charlie.

587
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,230
Alan.

588
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,850
I know I used to be hot-headed.

589
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,670
I'm sorry.

590
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,310
I should have obeyed you from the beginning.

591
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,860
Come on, I don't say anything to you.

592
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,690
I understand that you were sad at the time.

593
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,970
As for the plan that you mentioned.

594
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,270
If you've decided not to put me in the race, I understand.

595
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,810
Because you are the captain, I am ready to obey you.

596
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,500
Anyway, now Way isn't on our team.

597
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,010
So I'll let Dean race instead.

598
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,790
Really?

599
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,210
You said it already.

600
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,230
Yes!

601
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,170
Thank you very much.

602
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,100
Yes!

603
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,820
And then don't be upset and run away again.

604
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
Huh.

605
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,130
Did you know that when you're not here, Uncle can't eat at all?

606
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,990
He was so stressed that his hair fell out and his face became old.

607
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,720
North wants to get hit?

608
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,290
-Hey uncle.
-Take it easy.

609
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,710
-Sonic.
-Come here.

610
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,680
Hey, Babe.

611
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,920
Welcome Back.

612
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,920
Please be gentle.

613
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,150
Today, I take Ringside Racing viewers to

614
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,210
The Hallow once again.

615
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,640
I must say that it's closer to the end of the season like this.

616
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,130
The racing will be even more heated.

617
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,020
Today we are in the qualifying round.

618
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,350
Every driver must score the best possible score
in order to be able to start in the real race tomorrow.

619
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,340
Then let's see who our X-Hunter racers are, Sonic.

620
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,880
There are two racers, Dean and Charlie.

621
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,300
If you don't talk nonsense, look behind us, that's Dean.

622
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,510
Oh! He's checking the engine.

623
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,360
So handsome.

624
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,200
Okay, so another one is our new racer.

625
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,200
It's Mr. Charlie.

626
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,380
Hey, where did Charlie go?

627
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,420
Babe.

628
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,120
What's wrong?

629
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,920
Why are you here alone and not preparing yourself?

630
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,170
Other people are ready to race.

631
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,080
I've come to stay calm.

632
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,790
So, can you do it?

633
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,640
I just realized that when you have sense it's like this.

634
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,090
Both the sight, sound and smell

635
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,890
seemed to have been amplified by hundreds of percent.

636
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,870
I'm not conscious at all.

637
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,150
Do you now understand how difficult it was for me before?

638
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,480
Come here.

639
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,930
Sense is so good,

640
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,930
you probably don't need glasses anymore.

641
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,070
Well, I'm not as skilled as you.

642
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,050
May I help you?

643
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,240
Babe.

644
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,900
In the past I couldn't calm down

645
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,830
and you were able to help me.

646
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,230
Now if you can't focus, can I help you?

647
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,230
Or Papa doesn't want it.

648
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,040
I want it, mama.

649
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,420
You know, right, Babe?

650
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,930
No matter what happens.

651
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,530
You're the only reason I'm here.

652
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,170
The qualifying round has started.

653
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,640
Winner took first place, followed by Charlie from Team X-Hunter.

654
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,640
Dean tries to overtake

655
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,000
but Winner blocks.

656
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,720
Charlie still follows closely behind.

657
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,630
Dean tandem came up.

658
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,990
It's getting close.

659
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,980
Winner drives over.

660
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,210
Now they were very close and Charlie was starting to get closer.

661
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,540
Crowded at the curve.

662
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,060
Charlie still follows closely behind.

663
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,650
Winner took first place, followed by Charlie from Team X-Hunter.

664
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,930
X-Hunter is so poor.

665
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,370
Bringing an unknown person into the race

666
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,130
I'm sorry for the nice statistics that have to stop here.

667
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,520
I'm trying to decide if I'm going to be Alan's boy or not.

668
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,810
Would you like to be Alan's boy?

669
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,020
-What did you do to Charlie?
-I said I don't know.

670
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,650
Don't you know?

671
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,310
I asked you to capture him, not to kill him.

672
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,540
And now do you know?

673
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:00,640
How many hundreds of millions has the market price risen?

674
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:01,920
He just said.

675
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,300
He would give me everything the X-Hunter never gave me.

676
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,390
What's wrong, Charlie?

677
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,370
That you don't want me to race.

678
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,900
Is it because you're not confident in my skills?

679
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,330
I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.

680
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,060
I have followed my plan.

681
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,360
It's time for Daddy to keep the promise as well.

682
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:18,940
Turn and lift.

683
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:19,700
-Good.
-And after that...

684
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,240
-Then turn and lean on this.
-...take it up here.

685
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,060
(Younger are ready.)
Ahh!

686
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,950
Do we have to kiss?
And do we have to have sex?

687
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,760
Yes, you have.

688
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,600
(Uncle's hand touches this and that.)
Huh! Huh!

689
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,840
Let's get closer.

690
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,250
(Someone feels embarrassed about our younger 1ea.)

691
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,850
It's better to go home.

692
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,130
(Go back to being embarrassed at home.)

693
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,010
(Speak alone)

694
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,480
(Talk with the guardian spirit of a new born baby 1ea.)

695
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,920
(Not forbidden but joined in.)

696
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,180
Step back a bit.

697
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,660
Step back a bit, this piece of equipment is 100,000 baht.

698
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,880
100,000 baht!!!

699
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,770
(Pale face)
