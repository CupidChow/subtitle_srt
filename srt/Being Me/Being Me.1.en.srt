1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,975
(James 1:12)

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,512
(A man who endured)

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,183
(the test Blessed is the man that)

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,786
(endureth temptation for when he is tried)
Hey!

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,223
(The Lord promised those who love Him)
Hey!

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,991
(Because I will have the crown of life)

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,992
Your friend?

8
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,230
(When a human is tested)
We're almost there. Let's just go

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,034
(I am tempted by God. Do not complain)

10
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,470
(God is not tempted by evil)

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,207
(He himself has not tested anyone)
Could you just drop me here please?

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,224
Thank you

13
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,796
Sorry

14
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,164
My uncle, he just kept driving

15
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,133
Get on the bike

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,468
Hey

17
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,239
Ready?　-Hold on a second

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,674
Music?

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,242
Give it

20
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,813
Give it!

21
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,782
Take it quickly

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,384
What song did you choose?

23
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,219
Ready?
Off to go

24
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,432
Guys! You see that?

25
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,801
I am this much

26
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,170
Guys, This isn't fake

27
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,639
Please believe me

28
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:01,641
Oh my!

29
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,209
Goodness!

30
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,878
Oh my Partiya

31
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,914
Thank you for the 50 Likes

32
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,051
Oh, how long are you going
to keep him waiting?

33
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,519
Please accept my love soon

34
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,422
Please accept my love
before my shoulders break

35
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,992
I have to go now

36
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,294
See you in the evening

37
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,762
Bye

38
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,624
Jaenam?

39
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,929
Suhyun?

40
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,244
Hey

41
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,078
What are you doing?

42
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,479
Do the laundry

43
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,547
Can't you see?

44
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,450
Why do the laundry in the bathtub?

45
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,389
This T-shirt needs

46
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,824
hand-wash

47
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,198
wait!

48
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,852
Will it dry by tomorrow?

49
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,554
Not sure

50
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,091
Not sure?

51
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,959
What the..

52
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,763
How was the visit
to your father's grave?

53
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,798
Fine

54
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,803
By the way,
where were you coming from earlier?

55
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,872
School

56
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,740
School?
Yeah

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,975
Why?

58
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,911
Learn French during this vacation

59
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,347
You learn French?

60
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,349
Yeah

61
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,285
Suddenly why?

62
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,421
No reason

63
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,791
You're cheating me right?
You're not studying French

64
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,292
Say something in French

65
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,260
No, I don't want to　-Say something!
Say something!

66
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,263
When I see you smiling together

67
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,366
deep emotion

68
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,102
I was afraid of my love

69
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,271
What does that mean?

70
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,843
It means that
this shirt is hand-wash-only

71
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,748
"J'avispais mon amour".It means
you should wash the shirt by hand..

72
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,383
I'm not fooled

73
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,753
Stop it

74
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,256
Stop it

75
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,657
Please Stop

76
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,893
Stop

77
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,162
Stop it!

78
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,830
Don't touch it

79
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,932
Stop it

80
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,967
Stop it

81
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,502
Voila!

82
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,937
How do I look?

83
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,009
Pardon?

84
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,076
I said, How do I look?

85
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,081
You look.. great

86
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,751
I think so　-You look great

87
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,421
The recycled ripped jeans...

88
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,058
They seem eco-friendly and
functional as well with good ventilation

89
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,829
You could be close to mosquitoes

90
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,464
You, all

91
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,435
Have a death wish or something?

92
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,246
Suhyun, can you grab this end　-Yes

93
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,516
Hey

94
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,117
Let's all move to Seoul

95
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,254
No

96
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,256
Why would you move to Seoul
all of a sudden?

97
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,492
It's just boring here

98
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,293
and

99
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,497
I feel like I've completely
wasted the summer break

100
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,666
we're in high school

101
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,101
But you, guys, always do

102
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,906
By the way, What's up with the school
uniform even during the summer break?

103
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,842
It attracts more viewers

104
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,378
Ah...

105
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,656
Ah! it's annoying

106
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,033
Ah! Really...

107
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,474
Minhee, what's the matter?

108
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,009
Minhee　-Minhee

109
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,578
Are you mad at us?

110
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,016
You need a lot of money
to move to and live in Seoul

111
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,117
Minhee

112
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,686
Minhee..

113
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,227
I'm hungry

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,662
Uh?

115
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,967
Shall I make some ramen for you?

116
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,771
All right

117
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,077
-You don't have any ramen at home?
-Yes, Done

118
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,713
-I'll come with you to the store
-No, you can stay

119
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,637
You are moving up to Seoul, right?

120
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,577
Where did you hear that?

121
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,580
I heard my mom and your mom
talking on the phone

122
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,949
They said you are planning on
going to college in Seoul

123
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,851
Traitor!

124
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,722
I'm not moving

125
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,060
Why not?

126
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,664
you, guys, are staying

127
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,499
I can't move up there by myself

128
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,437
Hey, but...

129
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,708
I don't think your mom
would let you stay here

130
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,478
If you don't go to college,

131
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,014
Your mom might fall again

132
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,591
I don't know

133
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,126
Let's talk on the subject
for another time

134
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,628
I'm so hungry I can't think of anything

135
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,062
what are you doing?

136
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:37,997
You!

137
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:38,964
Uh?

138
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,433
You..

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,502
Remember you cracked my mobile screen,

140
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,239
And you promised
you would make up for it?

141
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,843
So?

142
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,948
Dance with me during the festival

143
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,518
You're to be my dance partner

144
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,755
No

145
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,590
You promised!

146
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,793
It's not going to happen

147
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,061
Hey!

148
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,298
I've already said on my show that
I am going to dance with you

149
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,499
You shouldn't have

150
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,934
You promised, Come on

151
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,302
Come on　-No way

152
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,703
Dance with me!　-No way, no way

153
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,840
Please, please

154
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,208
How do I do it

155
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,479
Place your right hand
on my left shoulder blade

156
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,449
And you firmly hold my hand
with your left hand

157
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,084
Firmly?

158
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,019
You don't let go of it

159
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,855
Ready?

160
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,471
I should get going
I need to my online show

161
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,307
Bye

162
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,201
Where are you going?

163
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,268
Home

164
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,637
I just bought ramen

165
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,839
Uh..

166
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,540
Thanks anyway

167
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,013
Good bye

168
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,094
I liked it

169
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,633
Guys!

170
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,637
Isn't it such a wonderful day?

171
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,874
Don't be surprised

172
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,642
Really...

173
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,044
I am..

174
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,212
I am no longer... Single!

175
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,381
Congratulations! Yeah!

176
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,884
There is this friend whom I have been
very fond of for long

177
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,419
He says..

178
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,586
To me...

179
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,122
something to tell me and has asked me
to meet him at the park

180
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,625
Is my make-up all right?

181
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,961
I'm not cheating you

182
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,665
He is going
to confess his feelings for me

183
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,836
And you, all are going to watch it
happening live here on my cam

184
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,471
Watch it!

185
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,395
You've waited long?

186
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,097
No, I just got here

187
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,204
Do you want a drink?

188
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,806
How thoughtful!

189
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,508
Thanks

190
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,620
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

191
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,630
If you have something to tell me,
I'm ready

192
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,874
Minhee　-Yes

193
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,180
About what happened yesterday,

194
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,584
Let's just forget that it ever happened

195
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,386
Pardon?

196
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,388
You are..

197
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,158
You're a popular and
probably the kiss means nothing to you,

198
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,593
But I just wanted to make it sure

199
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,297
Of course..

200
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,865
Yeah,

201
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm fine

202
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,174
And I already have someone that I like

203
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,511
Is that so?
Yeah

204
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,214
Who?

205
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,586
It's someone that you already know

206
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,794
Suhyun...

207
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,937
We're still good friends, right?

208
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,510
I need to get going

209
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,245
Minhee

210
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,247
Can you keep it just between us?

211
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,385
Does...

212
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,789
Does He knows that you love him?

213
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,559
No

214
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,730
It's probably better that way

215
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,799
What do you mean?

216
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,271
Don't ever tell him

217
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,740
You just keep it to yourself

218
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,379
I will

219
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:14,920
We are,

220
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,458
still good, right?

221
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,962
Yeah

222
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,498
Yeah..

223
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,368
I'll go first

224
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,947
Hello Mrs Lee..

225
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,683
Is Jaenam there?

226
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,119
He has been out of contact lately

227
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,287
Jaenam?

228
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,088
He has moved to Seoul

229
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,495
He needs to focus on
getting into college

230
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,467
By any chance,
You've watched that broadcast?

231
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,344
You know Jaenam likes to make jokes

232
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,251
So You..Don't mind what he said
on that broadcast

233
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,623
You're a smart kid,

234
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,927
You understand what I am saying, right?

235
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
How have you been?

236
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,916
Fine

237
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,622
Are you mad at me?

238
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,391
No

239
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,764
Have you seen Jaenam lately?

240
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,966
No

241
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,636
He has already left for Seoul

242
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,104
Right

243
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,673
He is leaving today

244
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,645
I've been meaning to tell you

245
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,213
that I'm so sorry..　-Today?

246
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,748
Uh?

247
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,549
Yes, today

248
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,185
I thought you already knew

249
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,621
Jaenam...

250
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,824
is leaving for Seoul today

251
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,574
Yes,

252
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,878
We're leaving now

253
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,581
Okay, leaving

254
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,947
Jaenam

255
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,785
"Me, too"

256
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,725
Jaenam

257
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,866
What are you doing?

258
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,768
Are we leaving right away?

259
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,436
Yes, we are

260
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,307
I'll be right back

261
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,008
Where? I've got no time

262
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,211
Let's go, Jaenam

263
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,713
-I'll be right back
-Where are you suddenly going?

264
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,683
I don't want to hear it　-Let's go

265
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,385
Jaenam

266
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,088
Are you going to piss me off?

267
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,327
Your dad is waiting
Let's go, Jaenam

268
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,596
Quick

269
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,765
Jaenam　-I'll be back, mom

270
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,767
I'll be back soon　-Jaenam!
