1
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,863
Go away.

2
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,299
What should we do?

3
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,718
Begin the next game.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
Sir, let me help.

5
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,372
Thanks so much.

6
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,167
You look great, sir.

7
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,758
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>The fourth game is about to begin.</i>

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,805
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

11
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>The fourth game is about to begin.</i>

12
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,355
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,982
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,342
Players,
what you witness before you

15
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,679
is what remains of those who broke
the rules for their own benefit.

16
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:22,016
They tainted the pure and fair ideology
everything here has been built upon.

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,520
Each and every one of you
is considered an equal

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,272
within the walls of this facility.

19
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,649
You must be guaranteed
the same opportunities

20
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,236
without being disadvantaged
or facing any kind of discrimination.

21
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,241
We truly apologize for allowing
such an unacceptable incident to occur.

22
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,398
EPISODE 6
GGANBU

23
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,151
ROUND 6
LIST OF WINNERS

24
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,530
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

25
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,196
Front Man speaking.

26
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,617
Yes. A minor disturbance took place.

27
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,161
But it's being addressed.

28
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,288
No need to worry.

29
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,582
We'll make sure
there's no trace of the disturbance

30
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,043
by the time the VIPs arrive.

31
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,257
Yes, sir. The game will begin on time,
in line with the schedule.

32
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,152
What's wrong? Are you sad?

33
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,781
Why? Is your connection dead?

34
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,161
I'll kill that little slut.

35
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,749
<i>Players,</i>
<i>welcome to the fourth game.</i>

36
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,045
<i>For this game, you will be playing</i>
<i>in teams of two.</i>

37
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>Please look around and find someone</i>
<i>you wish to play with.</i>

38
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,843
<i>When two people agree to play together,</i>

39
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,429
<i>shake hands to show</i>
<i>you have become partners.</i>

40
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,597
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

41
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>For this game, you will be playing</i>
<i>in teams of two.</i>

42
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,439
<i>Please look around and find someone</i>
<i>you wish to play with.</i>

43
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>When two people agree to play together,</i>

44
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,402
<i>shake hands to show</i>
<i>you have become partners.</i>

45
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
<i>There can only be two players per team.</i>

46
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,698
<i>You will have ten minutes</i>
<i>to find your partner.</i>

47
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,361
Hey, handsome.

48
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,696
Let's do this, huh?

49
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,990
I'm better than you think.

50
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,451
And I'm stronger than most guys too.

51
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,373
Guess what? I know how to con
just about anybody I see.

52
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,126
I'm not a genius,
but I still got it work out. Huh?

53
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,257
Hey, let me play with you.

54
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,551
Then I'll be your dream girl
all night long.

55
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,890
I'll do anything you tell me.
I'm not a regular girl.

56
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,141
Hmm?

57
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,267
Hmm?

58
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,859
You're pretending that you do not want me
on your team. Is that it?

59
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,653
Why? Can't decide?

60
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,530
Want me to choose instead, huh?

61
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,407
Stop embarrassing yourself.

62
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,325
No one will want to play
with you like this.

63
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,703
And you should all be honest.

64
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,666
You don't want a girl to team up with
or an old guy.

65
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,709
Of course we don't. We could die.

66
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,295
We already almost die
in the previous round.

67
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,422
This man is right.

68
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,968
And it was Adam's rib the Lord used
to make Eve after all.

69
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,346
And that's the reason
that we're choosing men.

70
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,767
-They played different roles than women.
-You idiot.

71
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,395
We're not playing in Eden right now.

72
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,648
Uh, hold on a second.

73
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,030
Why? You want a girl?

74
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,628
You're all idiots.

75
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:48,009
You two, you're making a big mistake,
and you're going to regret it.

76
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,516
-Sang-woo, let's--
-Ali, let's join forces.

77
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,521
Most of these games here,
you need to be strong or smart to win.

78
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,107
And I think if we're a team, we'll…

79
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,860
we'll beat a lot of the others out there.

80
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,911
Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no.

81
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
Uh, it's okay, really, it's…

82
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,915
Uh, you two will make
a great team together.

83
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,541
I'll find someone to play with.

84
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,678
Let's make this work.

85
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,949
Sir…

86
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,159
Sorry, but, um…

87
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,662
You know it's just, um…

88
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,873
-Uh…
-You should go put this on.

89
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,212
Just in case people here…

90
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,425
Well, they might look down on you
for missing it.

91
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,824
You and me…

92
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,117
We'll be the best team.

93
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,332
Hey.

94
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,295
Wanna do this?

95
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,882
Why should I?

96
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,386
I can't picture you going around here
and begging these jerks.

97
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,721
Hmm? Embarrassing.

98
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,557
What matters is winning.
Embarrassing or not.

99
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,933
Then play with me.

100
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,727
I'll make sure that you win.

101
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,853
What will you do?

102
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,187
Whatever it takes.

103
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,525
What do you see in me?

104
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,527
Well, I wanted to ask you that.

105
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,033
You were someone who looked like
they would come with me.

106
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,452
That's how I feel.

107
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,798
I promise, okay?
There's no option left here.

108
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,759
I teach Math at a high school.

109
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,219
And I can run too. Soccer every day.

110
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,183
Everyone was asking,
but I held out so you and I could win.

111
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,185
'Cause you and me would be great together.

112
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,356
The… the thing is…

113
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,816
…we don't know which game
we're playing, so…

114
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,319
Hey, choose me so it can just be done.

115
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,448
At this rate, nobody will be left for you,
and you won't continue.

116
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,283
You know,

117
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,912
since the man who'd been cheating
is gone, there's an uneven number.

118
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,207
Once everyone is in pairs,
there'll be one person.

119
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
And what happens to that one?

120
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,169
What do you think?

121
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,171
They'll be out and they'll get killed.

122
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,882
I would guess that old man there.

123
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,267
Stop dragging this out.

124
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,311
Let's play together.

125
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,578
Hey, old man.

126
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,123
Wanna do this together?

127
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>The time for finding</i>
<i>a partner is now over.</i>

128
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,089
You guys,
you're all making a big mistake.

129
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,175
Do you really think you can win
without me on your team?

130
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,554
It's me, Han Mi-nyeo!

131
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:06,559
I've made suckers out of everyone there is
from Dongducheon to Gangnam!

132
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,727
Guys…

133
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,399
What if you have to play <i>Gonggi</i>
or Elastics?

134
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,692
I'm an expert in those.

135
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,112
Babe, please, play with me.
Boys aren't very good at those.

136
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,989
-Hey. Get off.
-Come back!

137
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,993
-Hey, come on, be my partner.
-Oh.

138
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,953
Let's show everyone with a dick
they're wrong!

139
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,705
-Let her go.
-After us, we need to stick together.

140
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,915
-My gosh!
-I work well with women too!

141
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,543
-I'll be really good! I'll be--
-Stop it!

142
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,673
-Hey, don't trust this scumbag.
-Okay, okay.

143
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,676
He's a jerk. He's just gonna throw you
under the bus.

144
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,719
-Okay, sure.
-Look at me.

145
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,971
-That dead doctor and him worked together.
-Okay.

146
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,097
He played you.

147
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,059
He just wanted to save his own ass,
so he kept it secret from you all.

148
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,644
Tell me if I'm wrong, you jerk!

149
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,188
He was with him, guards!

150
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,647
-Hey.
-He deserves to die too!

151
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,399
Let… let go, bitch!

152
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,590
What? Hey, hold on a second.

153
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,218
Why is the room empty?

154
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,512
I still need a partner.

155
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,680
Hold on. Where did they go?

156
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,474
Who… who took my partner?

157
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,352
What's going on here? You can't do this!

158
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,728
Hey, I need a partner!

159
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,939
Let me go! Please!

160
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,483
Bring my partner here, you jerks!

161
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,735
Where's my partner?

162
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,030
I'm so sick of that whore.

163
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,324
It's nice to think
she won't be in my way again.

164
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,326
And, uh…

165
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,204
what she said about you in there,

166
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,373
you working with the doctor…

167
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,250
It's nothing.

168
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,545
That brat was so desperate,
she said whatever she could.

169
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,049
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>All players, please follow the staff</i>

170
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,176
<i>to your designated positions for the game.</i>

171
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,818
Ali.

172
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,988
Look at me. No one can stop us
if we work together.

173
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,659
I think you and I
could really win the money.

174
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
All right, let's do this and get out.

175
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,874
That money is ours
to give to both our families.

176
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,333
Let's do it.

177
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
You know, when I was a kid,

178
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,552
I live in a neighborhood just like this.

179
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,970
So did I.

180
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,430
And you know something?

181
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,265
-Our alleyway looked very similar.
-Really?

182
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,314
<i>Players,</i>
<i>please take one bag each</i>

183
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,024
<i>from the staff member before you.</i>

184
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,699
<i>There should be a set of ten marbles</i>
<i>in each bag.</i>

185
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>Please check to confirm the number.</i>

186
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,664
It's marbles.

187
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,958
Old man, we're gonna be playing with this.

188
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,586
-Hmm.
-Are you familiar with it?

189
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,422
Ah, yes, very familiar.

190
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,592
Used to have a lot as a kid. Ah!

191
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,011
Oh, yes, back in the day.

192
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,890
And you know, I was pretty good.

193
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,476
Not too bad myself.

194
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,769
-Ah, that's good news.
-Yeah.

195
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,146
I'm glad it's not just about our strength.

196
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,524
That means you and I are…

197
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,235
<i>gganbu</i> now, pretty great.

198
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>Gganbu</i>, huh?

199
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,950
I thought you said you played this before.
<i>Gganbu</i>, come on, you know.

200
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,159
It's a good friend.

201
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,286
One who you trust a lot.

202
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,080
You share things with them, you see?

203
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,082
-Ah!
-Your marbles, everything.

204
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,501
A <i>gganbu.</i> I remember now.

205
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,295
I had one in my town too.
Used to do everything with him.

206
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,340
Okay, we are <i>gganbu.</i>

207
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,008
Yes.

208
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,430
Should we do this to make it official?

209
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,308
Yeah, buddy. Like this.

210
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,854
-You and me, sir… Oh, no, <i>gganbu,</i> man.
-Yeah? Mm.

211
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,232
We'll go around this whole town,
and take all the marbles.

212
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>In this game,</i>
<i>using your set of ten marbles,</i>

213
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>you will play the game of your choice</i>
<i>with your partner.</i>

214
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,415
<i>The player who manages to take</i>
<i>all ten marbles from their partner wins.</i>

215
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,543
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

216
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,629
<i>Using your set of ten marbles,</i>

217
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,257
<i>play the game of your choice</i>
<i>with your partner.</i>

218
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,636
<i>The player who manages to take</i>
<i>all ten marbles from their partner wins.</i>

219
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,638
Oh, boy.

220
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,474
Shit, man.

221
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,483
Sang-woo.

222
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,948
How pretty.

223
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,952
Sir, excuse me.

224
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,331
<i>You will have 30 minutes for this game.</i>

225
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>Let the game begins.</i>

226
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,669
Uh, sir, come back.

227
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,278
Let's start.

228
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,115
That means one of us ends up dead,
doesn't it?

229
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,535
So both of us should do nothing then?
So we should just die?

230
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,831
Or one of us dies so the other can go on.

231
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,087
You haven't played before, right?

232
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,637
Since the Korean War,
nothing has been this sad.

233
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,639
Tragic.

234
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,517
What should we play then?

235
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,560
Wow. You're so cold.

236
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,771
As cold as ice.

237
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,734
So you a spy from the North or what?

238
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,528
Hey, stop the dumbshit, girl.

239
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,781
What game are we gonna play?

240
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,786
You tell me.

241
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,665
These boomers know all these games.

242
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,044
Ten marbles,
then we can create our own game.

243
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,214
Hmm. I'll try to come up with one.

244
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,136
We must be close.

245
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,639
Yes, it was somewhere around here, huh.

246
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,103
Come on, let's play. Sir, we need to, huh?
Come, let's play this right now.

247
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,105
This is so strange.

248
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,401
It should be here. This is the alley.

249
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,071
Where… My house, where did it go?

250
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,364
Sir, come back.

251
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:26,498
So you guess if I'm holding even or odd.
Which one you think is in here.

252
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,916
That all makes sense to you?

253
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,751
Even or odd?

254
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,254
What's that?

255
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,634
Odd is like one, three, five.

256
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,181
And even is two, four, six.

257
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,349
Understand?

258
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:51,523
Just think it through.
Then you wager a few of your own.

259
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,860
Odd.

260
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,829
Open your hand.

261
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,755
Ah, shit.

262
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,091
I should have added another one.

263
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,930
Stop giggling, asshole.

264
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,142
Hey, old man,
who are you calling asshole, huh?

265
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,104
You really think I'm your minion
just 'cause I call you "boss" a few times?

266
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,273
-You wanna die, you bastard?
-You wanna show me?

267
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,651
Ooh! So, how are you gonna do it?

268
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,113
Hmm? You can't resort to violence,
you puny little idiot dog.

269
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,789
Sir, we have to play now.
We gotta start right now.

270
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,666
Play what?

271
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,669
With our marbles. Let's go.

272
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,712
Why should I?

273
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,799
Look around you. Everybody else is too.

274
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,178
We gotta do this.

275
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,972
No.

276
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,892
That game is for little children.

277
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,562
No. Sir, come back here.

278
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,109
So let's…

279
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,945
end the game in one round.

280
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,201
All or nothing. A simple bet.

281
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,749
Don't tell me that you would
rather do what they are?

282
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,502
Watch.

283
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,922
-Bullseye! Yes.
-Ah, damn it.

284
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,135
-My turn.
-Okay.

285
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,137
Playing what then?

286
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,014
Why are you in such a hurry?

287
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,641
You're just dying to kill me, huh?

288
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,356
We're just playing one round here.

289
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,192
And we got time left too.

290
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,903
Let's wait till the end.

291
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,406
What are we gonna do before then?

292
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,450
Talk.

293
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,493
About what, though?

294
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,456
Things we never told anybody about
I guess.

295
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,377
One of us is gonna die here, so…

296
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,964
doesn't matter what we tell each other.

297
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,842
No one can really embarrass
themselves anymore.

298
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,594
Okay?

299
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,097
Even.

300
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,485
What's your wager?

301
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,697
Two.

302
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,133
You're up now.

303
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,304
I don't want to do this with you, sir.

304
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,806
Can I stop?

305
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,600
I would like to play with someone else--

306
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,477
Shut up and keep playing with me. Come on.

307
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,188
Sir, he's not in his right mind, sir.

308
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,648
I think he's got dementia.

309
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,733
That does mean that he's out or…

310
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,194
He's not gonna play.
So that means he forfeited, right? Huh?

311
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,947
Ah, shit.

312
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,911
Just one little game, okay?
Here, it'll be…

313
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,830
It'll be so much fun, sir.

314
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,416
No. I'd better go home now.

315
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:43,713
I know my house is nearby.
It's somewhere down this alley.

316
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,800
Shit! Goddamn it!

317
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,594
Will you please just pull yourself
together, old man?

318
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,931
They'll kill us both
if we don't get started soon!

319
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,810
You got that thing in your head,
so I bet you don't care what happens here,

320
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,229
but I won't just sit here and die, okay?

321
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,730
Listen, I can't die!

322
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,941
I need to get out of here.

323
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,693
Don't yell at me.

324
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,780
All right, I will, but don't yell.

325
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:19,374
…12, 13, 14, 15. Bam, okay.

326
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,545
We're playing something else.

327
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,339
No way. I'm not gonna stop now.

328
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,135
We already did things how you suggested.

329
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,180
I should get a chance to choose.

330
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,308
No.

331
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,270
Goddamn it.

332
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,357
You people said we're equals.
What is this?

333
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,110
I think we should play
a new game here, huh?

334
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,155
Request accepted.

335
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,247
What do you wanna play then, huh?

336
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,459
Even.

337
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,550
Do it. Show me.

338
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,207
You asshole.

339
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,836
You gotta be cheating.

340
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,756
Uh, Sang-woo, why would I do that to you?

341
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,716
How are you winning like this every round?

342
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,426
You keep beating me. How's that?

343
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,721
The odds should be 50-50.
That means you're cheating!

344
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,808
I didn't. No!
Sir, I wouldn't do that to you.

345
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,436
You jerk! You pretended not to know
how this works!

346
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,313
You said you haven't done this before!

347
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,316
How did you do it, huh? Spill it!

348
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,993
Why did you come here from the North?

349
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,370
I thought things were good over here.

350
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,667
And so?

351
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,836
Were you right?

352
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,636
Your family, are they here with you?

353
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,725
Just my brother.

354
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,852
Your parents?

355
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,027
My father got shot trying to swim
across the border and drowned.

356
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,278
Our mother…

357
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,992
she was hiding in China and got sent back
once the immigration agents found her.

358
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,122
Where is your brother now then?

359
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,586
In a shelter.

360
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,050
Even.

361
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,937
Odd. Even. Odd. Even.

362
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,065
So did I win?

363
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,318
What's your wager?

364
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,867
Oh…

365
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,878
We take turns throwing marbles

366
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,256
till you make a shot that lands
in the hole I dug over there.

367
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,758
Then what happens?

368
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,428
What happens is that person
gets to take everything on the ground.

369
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,847
Ah…

370
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,809
You mean, you want a way
to turn this around, huh.

371
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,561
-What? You scared?
-Not a chance.

372
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,647
I'm not worried at all.

373
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,819
I'm pretty good
at getting things in the holes, huh.

374
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,279
You sure about this, hmm?

375
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:27,038
If you win the money and get out of here,
what's your plan then?

376
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,625
I did this to get a house
where I could be with my brother first.

377
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,168
Then I'll get our mother out of the North.

378
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,382
Hey, with a price that big,
you can do a whole lot more than that.

379
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,509
You gotta want something else too.

380
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,678
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

381
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,515
Jeju Island.

382
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,850
Jeju Island?

383
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,812
There was a thing about it on TV.

384
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,940
It looked exotic.
It didn't look like Korea at all.

385
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,316
Hey.

386
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,986
Don't you think
you should dream bigger, huh?

387
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,282
Do Hawaii. Hold on, go to the Maldives
for a while instead.

388
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,950
And have a mojito too.

389
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,162
Mojito?

390
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,830
Like the movie.

391
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,498
Lee Byung-hun's in it.

392
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,626
"Go to mojito
and have a glass of Maldives."

393
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,545
Really?

394
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,507
Oh, no, we gotta fix that then.

395
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,759
Well, once we're out of here,

396
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,012
we'll have a girls' night out
and make mojitos and everything, okay?

397
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,352
Oh.

398
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,565
We can't both get out of here.

399
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,205
God, I'm so sorry, Ali.

400
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,208
I know you won't cheat.

401
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,294
But I can't die this way, I beg you.

402
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,047
They'll kill my family

403
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,675
if I don't get out of here.

404
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,678
Sorry, Sang-woo. No.

405
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,306
I'm so sorry.

406
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,975
I have to think of my family.

407
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,894
Hey, Ali. Hey.

408
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,938
Hey, come on, if you help me,

409
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,940
then there's a way
that both of us could live.

410
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,068
You only got this far 'cause I was there.

411
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,696
Like when I gave the bus fare to you and…

412
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,949
I'm the one who got the team
through Tug-of-War,

413
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,159
we kept watch at night together.

414
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,536
And just before this begin,

415
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,746
you and I swore
that we leave here together, right, Ali?

416
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,333
Listen, Ali, please.

417
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,211
Trust me, help me
and I'll make sure we get out of here.

418
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,088
Huh?

419
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,342
Okay. What do we do?

420
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,929
What is it? It might be odd.

421
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,851
On the other hand, it could be even.

422
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,689
-That must be it.
-Come on, hurry up and go.

423
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,941
Odd.

424
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,456
Look at that. I won again.

425
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,500
How many are in yours?

426
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,377
Uh…

427
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,673
Oh, shit.

428
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,092
Oh, shit.

429
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,692
I, uh…

430
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,611
I still have one.

431
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,279
I still have one more.

432
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,061
Yeah!

433
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,106
Goddamn it.

434
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,233
Okay, here's what I think.

435
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,403
I think there are gonna be teams out there
who can't decide the winner either.

436
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,364
Mm. Why not?

437
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,491
Think about how you win.

438
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,203
Remember the rules. Thirty minutes
to determine who will win or lose.

439
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,122
So think about it.

440
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,875
Some teams aren't gonna have a winner
when time is finally up, right?

441
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,753
You win and you lose,
and things just keep going on like that.

442
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,880
That means not every team
will have a winner.

443
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,840
What will they do?
Eliminate all those teams?

444
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,718
Makes no sense.
They have to decide who won. Don't they?

445
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,845
Yeah.

446
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,100
We'll play again.
We'll be working together.

447
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,436
We're teammates.
So we'll just add up everything.

448
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,106
Our team will go play other teams
with all 20.

449
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,609
You and I can play as a team

450
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,737
just like we planned to from the start.

451
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,408
You and I will get out of here.

452
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>Player 414, eliminated.</i>

453
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,045
Is that what you want?

454
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,715
You want them to do that to me?

455
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,012
<i>Player 2, eliminated.</i>

456
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,806
You ever have to see anyone die
before those?

457
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,644
Once, we have this plague
go through my town when I was a kid.

458
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,316
As time went on, more and more towns
got sick and died.

459
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,321
Soldiers started carrying the dead
into piles and lit them on fire.

460
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,576
That's how my grandpa, grandma
and older brother all died.

461
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,037
They burned together.

462
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,332
Damn. Your stories are
a bit too dark even for me.

463
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,502
And you?

464
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,504
What have you seen?

465
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,845
<i>Player 130, eliminated.</i>

466
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,722
First body I saw…

467
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,599
my mother's.

468
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,102
One day, I came back from school,

469
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,522
and my mom was lying there,
dead on the floor.

470
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,859
And next to her…

471
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,654
was my so-called dad with a knife.

472
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,617
The next body that I saw…

473
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,746
that was my dad's.

474
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,501
And the person standing there
holding the knife…

475
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,211
that was me.

476
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,757
He was a goddamn pastor too.

477
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,096
And when he hit her and…

478
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,017
did the things he did to me,
he would talk to God.

479
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,063
He'd always ask for forgiveness.

480
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,525
He didn't pray on that day
after he killed her.

481
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,822
I was too mad he even forgot, I guess.

482
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,253
<i>Player 40, eliminated.</i>

483
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,470
Even.

484
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,058
No, hold on. That's not what…
Wait a minute.

485
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,394
Just give me a second.

486
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,480
Odd.

487
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,899
Odd.

488
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,332
Which one did you just say?

489
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,173
What?

490
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,051
Can you repeat…

491
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,346
what you said just now?

492
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,894
Even.

493
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,688
I said…

494
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,398
even.

495
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,321
Oh.

496
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,324
I lost this one.

497
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,377
Oh.

498
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,142
We both can win this round? Are you sure?

499
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,518
Hmm.

500
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,479
You're positive?

501
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,565
Just hear me out first
and then turn me down if you like.

502
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,276
I mean it. Here.

503
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,404
Let me just give you this
to hold on to, okay?

504
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,659
So you won't have any guilt
around my death.

505
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,994
Your plan…

506
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,330
what is it?

507
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,416
<i>Player 68, eliminated.</i>

508
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,502
Well, it will depend
on who we're going against.

509
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,963
We need to know which teams will be here
after the round ends.

510
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,507
We better split up to get an idea

511
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,509
how all the other teams are doing
to be prepared.

512
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,470
Let's look for one
that seem too young or old,

513
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,223
and check only teams that are still
playing games at this point.

514
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,017
-Young or old?
-Yeah.

515
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,435
That's what we need.

516
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,105
Like someone who looks your same age

517
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,983
or someone who seems like
they're older than 50.

518
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,154
You go up a few blocks from here,
then meet up back up with me later, okay?

519
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,322
Okay, Sang-woo.

520
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,539
-Ali.
-Huh?

521
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,833
Your pouch there.

522
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,336
It's too dangerous to keep it out.

523
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,131
These people are bound to go crazy
before the end.

524
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,590
Who knows what'll happen then?

525
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,094
Lose it and we'll both die. You got that?

526
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,181
Here. I'll make sure that it's safe, okay?

527
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,787
What are you gonna do
if you win all that money and get out?

528
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,206
I don't know what I would do.

529
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,377
Someone was waiting

530
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,963
at the prison the day I got out.

531
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,759
I thought he was a creditor
who came to collect my dad's debt.

532
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,594
But he pulled out a card.

533
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,763
That weird card.

534
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,309
I had nowhere else to go, so I…

535
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,065
never thought about what I'd do
if I got the money.

536
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,944
Go with you to Jeju Island?

537
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,118
Sorry.

538
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,329
I forgot again.

539
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,374
<i>Player 229, eliminated.</i>

540
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,129
Oh, damn it.

541
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,632
Fuck.

542
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,344
Goddamn it.

543
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,751
I thought that was in. Damn it.

544
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,380
So you're all out?

545
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,801
Look at that.

546
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,720
One more right here.

547
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,145
Deok-su.

548
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,565
Nice knowing you.

549
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,973
That blue that went in,
that's mine, asshole!

550
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,433
Shit.

551
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,518
It was nice knowing you, you shithead.

552
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,069
Damn it!

553
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,450
Okay.

554
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,369
Oh. Oh.

555
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,789
You are all assholes!

556

<i>Player 278, eliminated.</i>

557
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,552
Done.

558
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,514
Here.

559
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,349
How's that?

560
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,934
It feels safer like that, doesn't it?

561
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,979
Yeah.

562
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,107
When the timer says three minutes,
come and meet up with me here.

563
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,567
Then I'll tell you what we do next.

564
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,114
Odd.

565
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,581
One, two, three.

566
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,001
One, two, three.

567
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,422
We've got three each.

568
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,636
Yeah, but, um, what was your guess?

569
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,222
Huh?

570
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:44,311
Oh, yeah. But which one did I guess?

571
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,982
You said even was your guess.

572
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,817
Did I…

573
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,152
Did I say that?

574
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,574
Yeah.

575
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,496
That means…

576
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,499
that I lost again.

577
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,594
<i>Player 43, eliminated.</i>

578
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,599

580
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,438
No, no, no, no, no.

581
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,356
Three youngsters.

582
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,066
Oh, get out of the way.

583
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,193
Two old people.

584
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,122
<i>Player 276, eliminated.</i>

585
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,145
Come on. It's your turn.

586
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,188
Huh?

587
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,191
Oh. Right.

588
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,360
Here.

589
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,748
Odd.

590
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,918
Oh.

591
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,171
Hold on. What's today's date?

592
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,966
My son has his birthday soon.

593
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,470
What day is it? The 24th?

594
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,350
I was going to buy him a toy robot
for his birthday.

595
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:51,063
This year, I need to get him a gift.
I completely forgot last year.

596
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,567
I better do that soon.
I can't forget again.

597
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,199
Oh.

598
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,576
My hand.

599
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,248
What was your guess? A-Again?

600
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,460
Odd.

601
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,962
Oh.

602
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,797
Oh.

603
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,276
I have 20 marbles.

604
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,528
The rule said we could play

605
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,906
whatever game to get our opponent
to give us theirs,

606
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,451
and the players cannot acquire them
using violence.

607
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,621
Well, I made absolutely sure
no harm was done.

608
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,173

Let's do this.

612
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,212
Whoever throws one over there

613
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,048
and makes the shot that comes closest
to the wall, wins.

614
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,008
How's that?

615
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,724
It's Sae-byeok.

616
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,434
What is?

617
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,977
My name.

618
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,438
Kang Sae-byeok.

619
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,525
Sae-byeok.

620
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,693
Pretty.

621
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,571
And you?

622
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,739
Ji-yeong.

623
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,075
Your family name?

624
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,704
Don't have one. That's it.

625
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,336
Who should go first then?

626
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,504
It should be your turn.

627
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,298
Since your number is lower.

628
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,392
Let me see. Darn it.
I'm out of marbles.

629
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,061
Mm.

630
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,357
What should I do, huh?

631
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,652
I'd love to keep playing.

632
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,157
Hey. Would you let me

633
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,661
borrow one from you? Just for a while.

634
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,208
Sir, I'm sorry.

635
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,881
-<i>Player 70, eliminated.</i>
-Oh.

636
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,008
Look at that.

637
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,303
Forgot I had another one here.

638
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,725
Not out yet.

639
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,143
One more to go.

640
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,193
Two, four, six, eight.

641
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,071
Two, four, six, eight. Nineteen.

642
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,531
Nineteen.

643
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,660
Uh… Sir, wait. Hold on a second.

644
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,203
Sir, come back!

645
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,703
Hey, what are you doing?

646
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,500
I lost. You won.

647
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,877
Stop. Why the hell
would you try to do that?

648
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,089
Hey, butter fingers, what else can I say?

649
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,925
What you said

650
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,053
making sure that I won.
Is that what this is?

651
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,808
You think I'll be thankful
that you did this, huh?

652
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,643
Take another throw.

653
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,812
And I still wouldn't be able to win.

654
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,023
Ugh. Just let me lose
this thing in style, okay?

655
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,151
Ji-yeong, that's bullshit!
Stop acting cool and just do a real throw!

656
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,531
I have nothing.

657
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,241
What?

658
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,703
You got a reason to get out of this place,

659
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,164
but I don't.

660
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,212
I thought hard about what I'd do.

661
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,175
If I were the one who got out
since you asked me earlier.

662
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,180
No matter how hard I thought, though,
I got nothing.

663
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,645
The one who should have a reason
to get back out there…

664
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,897
that's what's right.

665
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,364
You can do it. Don't die in here, okay?

666
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,283
And go…

667
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,745
And go meet your mother.

668
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,873
Go get your brother too.

669
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,877
And go to Jeju Island.

670
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,632
Sang-woo.

671
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,386
Sang-woo, where are you?

672
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,306
Sang-woo? Sang-woo, hello?

673
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,808
I'm done with this side.

674
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,227

675
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,689

678

I'm honored…

679
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,006
that we were partners.

680

<i>Player 240, eliminated.</i>

681
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,655
Sir, please. Let's just…
let's just play one more time, huh?

682
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,407
Come on, one more round.

683
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,576
Oh.

684
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,952
Oh, shit.

685
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,245
It's this one.

686
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,666
Yes, this is it.

687
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,544
My wife and I had this one here.

688
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,256
I raised my son right in here.

689
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:03,263
Yes. I even had a nice little pond
right here in the front yard.

690
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,765
Sir, please,
you have one marble left.

691
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,851
We're running out of time, sir.

692
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,355
And I, I would come home from work,

693
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:17,861
and see my son, his friends
were always here and they would all play,

694
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,905
and they wouldn't even know I was here.

695
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,448
You need to get it together!

696
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,034
Get it together and play with me again
right now, understood?

697
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,913
I would hide and I'd go
just behind the utility pole there

698
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,166
and take a peek at all of them playing
and just watching.

699
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,419
They would always have so much fun.

700
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,879
Sir, please.

701
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,216
Try to snap out of it, sir.

702
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,971
Oh, God. Sir, I'm begging you.

703
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:54,981
Why don't we do one more and bet it all?

704
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,653
What?

705
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,530
Everything that I still got,

706
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,742
and everything that you'd…

707
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,913
You can't possibly mean that.

708
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,250
You're gonna take yours and bet it all,

709
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,337
and I'll do the same
with everything that I still got here.

710
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,966
Okay? Keeps everything fair.

711
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,678
I'll wager all I got just to get your one?

712
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,515
What kind of nonsense is this?

713
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,351
There's no sense at all!

714
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,145
So then…

715
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,066
that's what you did this whole time.

716
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,571
Does tricking your friend like that
make sense to you?

717
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,396
Take it.

718
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,650
It's yours anyway.

719
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,322
We are…

720
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,782
<i>gganbu</i>, aren't we?

721
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,535
Don't you remember?

722
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,914
When you and I swore
that we were <i>gganbu</i> buddies.

723
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,588
<i>Gganbu</i> always share everything
with each other no matter what.

724
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,556
Thank you.

725
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,560
You made all this…

726
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,439
a good experience.

727
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,567
What a great way to go.

728
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,111
Really.

729
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,410
It's okay.

730
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,621
Hey.

731
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,332
Everything's okay.

732
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,716
Mm.

733
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,468
It will be okay.

734
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,481
Hey, I remember my name now.

735
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,151
My name is Il-nam.

736
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,862
Oh Il-nam.

737
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,006
<i>Player 1, eliminated.</i>
