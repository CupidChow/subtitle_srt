EPISODE 8
FRONT MAN

2
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,254
Why'd you do that?

3
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,091
What the hell did you expect, huh?

4
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,884
Why go up and push that guy?

5
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,805
You got lucky waiting
in the back of the line.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,266
Must have forgotten how things are here.

7
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,895
What if that guy ended up wasting our time
on that one step like that criminal?

8
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,022
Would you have done nothing?

9
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,524
But he was on the last tile.

10
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,652
He would move to the next one soon.

11
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,862
How can you know that, huh?

12
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,991
That last guy could tell
the tempered glass apart the whole time,

13
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,535
but he watched all
those poor bastards out there die.

14
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,789
The only reason you and I even made it
is 'cause he could tell the tiles apart.

15
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,292
Come on! Just stop it with this bullshit.

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,502
That guy is not the reason
that I'm still here, okay?

17
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,462
I'll tell you the reason.

18
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,841
It's that I'm willing to do
almost anything to win this.

19
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,718
Stop with the excuses. I'm not buying it.

20
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,470
You still killed someone.
His bullet is in your hands.

21
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,680
Get it together, huh.

22
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,934
We'll be killing everyone
if we want that money.

23
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,270
Think about it for just one second.

24
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,858
You should be happy that there's someone
who's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

25
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,862
And if it were me on that tile?

26
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,740
Come on!

27
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,617
Gi-hun!

28
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,830
Your life is so damn pathetic,
and here's why.

29
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,543
It's because you always gotta open
your mouth and ask something idiotic.

30
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,380
Because you're a nosy-ass idiot
who's too slow to keep it shut.

31
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,843
Someone who always has to get into trouble
but somehow can't tell he's in it.

32
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,430
Okay.

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,309
That's right.
That's how I got caught in all this.

34
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,439
Because I was slow, crazy incompetent.

35
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,193
Just a dimwit who lives off his mother,
but you're with me in this place.

36
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,444
Isn't that interesting?

37
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,739
Why is that?

38
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,284
Ssangmun-dong's golden child,
the genius Cho Sang-woo,

39
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,661
who went to SNU was here?

40
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,080
Rolling around this shithole,

41
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,415
slamming with us, simpletons, huh!

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,169
Is it my fault that you're here?

43
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,852
Players, we sincerely
congratulate and commend you all

44
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,772
for successfully making it
through the first five games.

45
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,568
The three of you are now the finalists

46
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,406
and as such, we have prepared
a special gift for each of you.

47
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,200
Before we reveal the gift,

48
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,787
please take a moment to change
into the outfits we have brought.

49
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,307
Bring him to me alive.

50
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,949
JUNE 29, MONDAY

51
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,452
CHIEF

52
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,207
-<i>Jun-ho!</i>
-It's me, Chief.

53
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,292
-<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
-Can you hear me all right, sir?

54
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,212
-<i>I haven't seen or heard from you in days!</i>
-Just hold on, I'll explain it later.

55
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,089
-<i>Who the hell do you think you are?</i>
-Look, I'm somewhere southwest

56
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,257
-of the mainland.
<i>-What?</i>

57
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,633
Can you try to locate my signal?

58
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,218
-Put a whole team together for this.
<i>-What?</i>

59
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,928
<i>-A whole team?</i>
-I need backup.

60
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,556
You gotta get a whole squad.
The police, coast guard, everyone.

61
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,266
<i>What did you say?</i>
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

62
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,601
Let me send over a couple of things, okay,
and take a look.

63
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,270
<i>-Slow it down--</i>
-I'll call you again soon.

64
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,354
<i>What did you do…</i>

65
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,702
Tonight's feast
is prepared as a token of gratitude

66
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,664
for the sacrifice and effort
that you finalists have made,

67
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:05,294
and to encourage you all to perform
even more splendidly in the final game.

68
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,130
Now please relax and enjoy your feast.

69
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,837
RE-SEND

70
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,887
He's over there.

71
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,995
Ah.

72
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,006
Police. Put down your weapons,
you got that?

73
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,761
We already know everything about you all.

74
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,721
The coast guard will be here soon.

75
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,516
I don't know.

76
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,811
Have the Korean police
ever been quick to act?

77
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,565
And besides, you barely get
any signal around here.

78
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,068
I don't know what you tried to send,

79
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,362
but I doubt it went through.

80
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,782
Come and turn yourself in.
You'll get a plea bargain with that.

81
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,952
If you drop your gun right now
and hand over the phone,

82
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,204
I might let you live.

83
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,997
Stop right there.

84
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,627
That gun of yours holds five bullets.

85
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,005
But for police regulations,

86
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,218
one chamber must remain empty,
and one must be filled with a blank.

87
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,179
That leaves three live rounds.

88
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,807
You've already used one to kill a man

89
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,601
and another one to break the lock.

90
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,941
Which means that there's only
one bullet left in your gun.

91
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,693
One bullet is more than enough
to kill you.

92
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,704
<i>Give up.</i>

93
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,292
I warned you.

94
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,335
Take another step and…

95
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,972
This is over.

96
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,850
Now come with me.

97
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,439
Do as I say.

98
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,067
Or you die.

99
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,996
Who the hell…

100
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,789
are you?

101
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,852
In-ho.

102
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,897
Let's go.

103
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,860
Make this easy.

104
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,717
Brother…

105
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,803
In-ho, why?

106
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,402
Sae-byeok.

107
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
It's all right.

108
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,201
I didn't come here to kill you.

109
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,121
You've been dozing off.

110
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,040
I'd have killed you already
if I wanted to.

111
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,590
I have this with me
because of Sang-woo there.

112
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,594
Protection, you know.

113
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,914
You're not holding up too well, huh?

114
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,126
No, it's okay. I feel fine.

115
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,296
So how come you barely touched
your food earlier?

116
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,592
It wasn't very well cooked, that's all.

117
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,431
Stop lying, please.

118
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,810
And if I'm hurt?

119
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,438
Are you gonna try to treat it?

120
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,236
You need to think about yourself.

121
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,447
Just leave me. I'll be okay.

122
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,119
Hey, Kang Sae-byeok.

123
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,622
We should stick together.

124
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,916
We can beat him.

125
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,960
Whatever the game,

126
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,213
we'll help each other get through this
as teammates.

127
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,596
Show that psychopath what we can do.

128
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,149
Share all that prize money
and just run away.

129
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,704
And do you know what you're gonna do
with all that money once we get out?

130
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,081
I'd pay my debt off first.

131
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,838
And buy a nice clean store
in the city for my mom.

132
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,262
She always hoped to run a, a real store,
not just the kind of little stall.

133
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
And I would…

134
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,271
finally start being a dad to my girl…

135
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,319
for once in my life.

136
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,362
How old is your daughter?

137
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,239
She's ten.

138
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,660
That's also how old my little brother is.

139
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,541
And where is your brother staying now?

140
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,627
In orphanage.

141
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,383
I promised that
he'd get out of there soon.

142
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,346
Our mother is stuck in the North
right now.

143
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,894
I said I'd get her once I was able
to make enough money,

144
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,520
and I'll get us all a house.

145
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,275
There's so much in there. I think
even with half, you'll have plenty.

146
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,906
Hey, Gi-hun.

147
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,871
I think you and I should make a deal.

148
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,128
What kind of deal?

149
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,218
Just in case either of us…

150
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,639
can actually make it out
of this hellhole somehow,

151
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,601
we'll look after
each other's loved ones, okay?

152
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,190
Don't say that. Come on.

153
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,613
We'll beat Sang-woo,
and then, we'll get out of here together.

154
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,787
I still want you to swear, though.

155
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,754
I need you to swear
that you'll look after him.

156
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,383
Shh.

157
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,548
Don't do it.

158
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,886
That isn't you.

159
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,472
You're a good person at heart.

160
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,910
Hey.

161
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,745
Hey, what's wrong?

162
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,955
Hey, you're… you're…

163
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,457
You're…

164
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,751
What happened? When?

165
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,212
When did you get hurt?

166
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,713
Shit.

167
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,175
-Mister.
-Huh?

168
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,096
I think I wanna go.
I'd like to go home now.

169
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,892
Hey, hold on, Sae-byeok. Stay here.

170
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,229
Don't let yourself go.
Just keep on holding this.

171
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,231
I'll go get someone, okay?

172
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,280
Hey, hey! We need help.

173
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,865
She's lost a lot of blood!

174
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,367
Somebody get in here!

175
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,993
There's a badly injured girl!

176
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,246
Is anybody out there?

177

Get in here, you assholes!

178
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,835
Someone's dying! Hello?

You need her alive
if you want her in the next round!

Somebody out there, please, answer me!

182
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,308
Oh. Hey!

183
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,687
Could you please get a doctor?
She's lost a lot of blood.

184
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,397
Hurry! Please.

185
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,149
She's…

186
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,890
Sae-byeok.

187
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,189
Sae… Sae-byeok.

188
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,982
Sae-byeok.

189
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,734
No.

190
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,362
Oh, no. Oh, Sae-byeok.

191
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,281
Oh, no. Sae-byeok, no.

192
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,026
Jun-ho…

193
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,581
In-ho, why?
