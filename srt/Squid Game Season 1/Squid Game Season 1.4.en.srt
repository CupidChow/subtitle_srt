1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,659
Thank you.

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,172
-<i>Gi-hun, wait.</i>
-Huh?

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,676
Nothing.

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,971
You saved me.

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:55,930
What?

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,809
You're the reason
I got through this round.

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,329
-Sirs, you made it!
-Oh.

8
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,295
I'm glad you made it.

9
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,838
I was really worried.

10
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,217
It will take a whole lot more
killing Gi-hun. Hah!

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,636
I got Ssangmun-dong running
through this heart, huh?

12
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,014
Are you holding up all right here, mister?

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,516
I'm okay. Yes.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,477
All thanks to your sharp thinking.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,854
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,898
I was wrong to suggest separating.

17
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,652
Ah, don't say that.

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,279
How could you know what it was?

19
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,240
Choosing the umbrella was my call.

20
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,992
-Don't worry, okay?
-Mm.

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,245
Yeah, the whole team made it.

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,873
<i>Attention, players.</i>

23
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>I will now announce</i>
<i>the results of the second game.</i>

24
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,633
<i>Out of the 187 players who participated,</i>

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>79 players were eliminated.</i>

26
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,410
<i>The prize money accumulated this round</i>
<i>is 7,9 billion won.</i>

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>The total prize money accumulated so far</i>
<i>is now 34,8 billion won.</i>

28
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,509
EPISODE 4
STICK TO THE TEAM

29
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,262
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Your mealtime begins now.</i>

30
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,266
<i>All players, please form a line</i>
<i>in the center of the room.</i>

31
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,533
This is all we get?

32
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,000
Asshole.

33
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,337
I came just close to dying.

34
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,965
And what do I get for all of that?
An egg for a meal.

35
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,604
Are they kidding us with this shit?

36
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,526
Hey. Sorry, I'm coming through.

37
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,028
Coming through.

38
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,529
Excuse me. Thank you.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,823
Excuse me.

40
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,202
Hey, miss, what are you doing, huh?

41
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,625
Shut your mouth and grab an egg.

42
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,524
Uh, I didn't get anything.

43
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,733
Where's the rest?

44
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,444
Hey, we didn't get our meals either.

45
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,530
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,990
Five meals are missing, sir.

47
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,575
We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

48
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,910
Then where is ours?

49
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,787
Please, sir, we need to eat!

50
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,832
-It was prepared for the exact number.
-Excuse me.

51
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,711
It was them. They…

52
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,132
skip the line and got seconds. I saw it.

53
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,221
Hey, what's the matter, everybody? Jeez.

54
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,515
You never see a guy eat before,
is that it?

55
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,475
Shit.

56
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,896
Who do you think you are?

57
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,606
That's my food you just ate.

58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,985
Ah. So, uh, is this yours?

59
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
Is your name on it?

60
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
'Cause I sure don't see anything.

61
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,202
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,787
Give me that.

63
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,081
Give it back. It's mine.

64
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,374
Give it back to me!

65
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,089
You little shit, goddamn it.

66
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,759
Why did you break it, you jerk?
How was this, huh?

67
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,638
How come a scrawny guy like you
is so greedy about food?

68
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,057
You piece of shit!

69
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,811
Hey, listen up. You should learn to share.

70
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,189
Is it too hard, you dumbass?

71
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,276
You bastard!
What the hell? You shithead.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,154
Shit.

73
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,589
Hey, you okay? Hey, wake up.

74
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,101
He's gone.

75
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,528
Uh, hello, guards.

76
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,823
Can someone do something?

77
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,328
Hey, didn't you hear that?

78
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,706
A person died.

79
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,000
That man there just died.

80
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,089
Look, that man was killed.

81
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,883
That bastard…
That bastard just killed him.

82
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,139
He just killed someone over there!

83
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,600
He just died!

84
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,019
Can't you hear me, huh?

85
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,189
<i>Help us now!</i>

86
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>A man just died!</i>

87
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,485
<i>We shouldn't be</i>
<i>killing each other like this!</i>

88
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,658
<i>Player 271, eliminated.</i>

89
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,814
You there.

90
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,025
Why aren't you doing your job?

91
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,365
I'm sorry, sir.

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,117
How may I be of service?

93
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,081
Did you forget the rules?

94
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,209
You do not speak
unless your superior allows you to.

95
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,113
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

96
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,614
<i>-Lights-out in 30 minutes.</i>
-Hurry! It'll be bedtime soon.

97
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>Please return to the quarters now.</i>

98
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,789
We can't fall asleep tonight, okay?

99
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,166
Who knows what someone else may try.

100
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,338
Look at them. It looks like
they're planning something.

101
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,091
If they try to attack someone,

102
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,136
let's group together and fight them.

103
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,222
Come to our side if anything goes wrong.

104
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,016
Okay, I will.

105
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,020
Sir, wake up.

106
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,899
Wake up, sir.

107
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,155
Sorry, but you really can't go to sleep
after lights-out, understand?

108
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,781
Why?

109
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,909
We gotta keep an eye out.
It will be dangerous.

110
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,162
And we'll come here if anything goes down.

111
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,372
Uh. Okay.

112
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,717
Hey, pickpocket.

113
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,638
Are you okay?

114
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,558
It looked like you and that thug
really had it out for each other.

115
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,061
So what?

116
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,148
Tonight, if anything happens,
we'll all meet in my bed right there.

117
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,485
Are you in?

118
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,240
I don't trust people.

119
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,244
And that's twice as true for anyone
who'd end up in here. Got it?

120
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,080
You think that's how it works, huh?

121
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,251
Listen, you don't trust people here
because you can.

122
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,672
You do it because
you don't have anybody else.

123
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,640
Where is the delivery team?

124
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,864
Number 28,
why are you alone?

125
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,866
Number 29 didn't show up.

126
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
-Was there an accident?
-I don't know.

127
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,079
Then you'll need to deliver this alone.

128
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,374
I can't go underwater
by myself. It's too dangerous.

129
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,875
Enough! Tell me now.

130
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,002
The next game, what is it?

131
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,514
Are you sure?

132
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,893
If I get eliminated,
then I can't do all of this.

133
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,396
Worry about that
after you survive the night.

134
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,565
What's tonight?

135
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,066
Fighting will break out.

136
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,237
We gave you less food on purpose
to make you all fight each other.

137
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,532
Weeding out the weaklings
before the next game begins.

138
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,825
It's all part of the game.

139
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,202
You know we can't
protect you when you're in there.

140
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,664
Go back to the players
and find a way to live.

141
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,458
Way to live?

142
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,084
Stick with the strongest.

143
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,128
That's the only way you'll live.

144
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,425
You're a strong team.

145
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,595
Let me join.

146
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,847
Why should we?

147
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,352
Tell us, what are you good at?

148
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,603
I'm a doctor out there.

149
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,605
You might need me.

150
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,648
So?

151
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,235
You're gonna come give me a shot
if I get sick?

152
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,784
Go sit somewhere in the corner,
come lights-out.

153
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,828
Don't breathe or make a noise.

154
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,163
If I hear you breathe…

155
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,459
then I'll come for you.

156
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,676
I know what the next game is.

157
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,305
<i>Players,</i>
<i>lights-out in two minutes.</i>

158
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,603
<i>Attention, staff.</i>
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

159
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,606
<i>Will all managers, soldiers and workers,</i>

160
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,359
<i>please make your way</i>
<i>to your designated locations.</i>

161
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>Let me repeat the instruction.</i>

162
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,408
<i>Will all managers, soldiers and workers,</i>

163
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,411
<i>please make your way</i>
<i>to your designated locations.</i>

164
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>Lights-out in 30 seconds.</i>

165
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,608
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

166
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

167
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,234
You saw us, huh?

168
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,586
Do it.

169
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,910
Ah!

170
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,084
You asshole!

171
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,540
-Gi-hun, are you okay?
-Yeah. Thanks, Sang-woo.

172
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,626
Where's the old man?

173
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,003
-I'm not sure.
-Gi-hun.

174
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,480
-He's not here.
-Oh, no.

175
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,400
Hey, old man! Are you there?

176
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,902
Old man!

177
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,091
Let me out!

178
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,616
You're here.

179
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,826
Like you said.

180
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,765
Hey, Ssangmun-dong, what are you doing?

181
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,352
We're just helping cull the herd.

182
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,855
She's our teammate, you got that?

183
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,150
Teammate?

184
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,237
All of you, stop this.

185
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,408
I'm… I… I'm scared.

186
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,913
We are all gonna die in here!

187
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:11,793
Everyone, every single one of us
is going to die!

188
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,380
<i>Please. I'm so scared.</i>

189
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,967
<i>Stop this madness!</i>

190
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,220
-End it.
-<i>If you keep this going,</i>

191
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>then we're all going to die in here!</i>

192
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,258
Drop your weapon.

193
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,344
Turn around.

194
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:29,538
<i>Player 277, eliminated.</i>
<i>Player 74, eliminated.</i>

195
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,290
<i>Player 198, eliminated.</i>

196
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,416
<i>Player 87, eliminated.</i>

197
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,460
-Player 456.
-<i>Player 222, eliminated.</i>

198
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,046
-Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?
<i>-Player 301, eliminated.</i>

199
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>-Player 416, eliminated.</i>
-We don't use our names in this place.

200
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,136
<i>Player 361, eliminated.</i>

201
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,306
<i>Player 328, eliminated.</i>

202
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,183
<i>Player 103, eliminated.</i>

203
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,686
<i>Player 444, eliminated.</i>

204
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,479
<i>Player 6, eliminated.</i>

205
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,231
<i>Player 206, eliminated.</i>

206
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,442
<i>Player 233, eliminated.</i>

207
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,861
<i>Player 239, eliminated.</i>

208
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,012
Are you all right?

209
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,306
Huh?

210
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,684
All of the… That was dangerous.
When did you get up there?

211
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,687
We were worried about you, sir,
when you disappeared.

212
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,898
Nobody here got hurt so that's good.

213
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,614
Uh, well, at this point,
we should know what to call each other.

214
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,575
Why don't we go around
and tell each other our names now.

215
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,535
I know your name already, though.

216
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,495
Ssangmun-dong.

217
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,916
Ssangmun-dong is just my hometown.

218
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,085
The name is Seong Gi-hun.

219
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,920
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

220
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,548
So then, what about your name?

221
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:04,966
Ali.

222
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,135
Ali Abdul.

223
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,762
And where are you from?

224
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,055
Pakistan.

225
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,139
Pakistan?

226
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,016
Where is that?

227
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,184
North of India.

228
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,352
He's right.

229
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,648
Of course, he is.
This man here went to SNU--

230
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,982
Cho Sang-woo.

231
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,411
Come on, really?

232
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,997
We're all teammates here now.

233
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,877
We should really know about each other,
build up a little trust, okay?

234
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,048
Kang Sae-byeok.

235
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,216
Sae-byeok?

236
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,385
That's a pretty name.

237
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,554
Though I'm not sure how well it fits.

238
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,849
And what is your name, sir?
If you don't mind.

239
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,352
What?

240
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,729
My name?

241
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,357
Oh.

242
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,151
It…

243
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,115
Uh…

244
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,409
Let me think.

245
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,330
Hold on, it…

246
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,000
So…

247
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,377
It…

248
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,588
They call me…

249
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,673
It's okay.

250
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,468
Hey, old man, you must be
really shook up today.

251
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,636
You know when I'm stressed,

252
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,638
my home address
slips right out of my head.

253
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,765
Along with my social security.

254
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,478
It'll be okay
once you get some rest.

255
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,821
Damn it.

256
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
That hurts. Doctor, my ass.

257
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,994
I'm almost done here.

258
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,915
Thankfully, it didn't go in too far.
You'll be fine.

259
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,793
Outside, I'll be able to treat it
at the hospital, okay?

260
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,922
Pretentious dickhead.

261
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,592
You must have lost your practice
to be in this place.

262
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,011
I will get out of here.

263
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,556
With that money.

264
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,937
Those bastards.

265
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,483
Why they make it so we could kill
other players and then end it like this?

266
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,068
Games will be over.

267
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,278
We could've ended this whole thing
right there and then.

268
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,864
If we kill everyone else,
what happens to us?

269
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,826
And won't we get to…

270
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,120
take all that money?

271
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:45,001
We'll be able to try and kill them again
as long as we don't die.

272
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,296
Right, Doc? In the next game.

273
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,176
All done.

274
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,680
I guess this is why everyone says

275
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,057
you really should have a doctor
in your family.

276
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
We got rid of quite a few.

277
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:09,234
Players down from 107 to 80,
that means we killed 27?

278
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,445
Right, old man?

279
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,239
"Old man"?

280
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,157
You're gonna call me that?

281
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,993
You seem way older than me.

282
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,119
Oh, yeah?

283
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,954
Tell me how old do I look?

284
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:21,997
Forty-nine.

285
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,751
Oh, please. I guess I shouldn't have
lent you that lighter then, huh?

286
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,752
Thirty-nine?

287
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,462
Old man, one more chance.

288
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,257
Uh…

289
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,342
Nineteen?

290
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,597
Bingo.

291
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,934
You're a quick learner.

292
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,898
But what's my…

293
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,400
reward for guessing?

294
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,697
I'll go think about it
in the restroom, okay?

295
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,668
I'm going to the bathroom too.

296
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,385
Old man.

297
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,555
You and that doctor are hiding something.

298
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,728
There's nothing to hide.

299
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,367
Old man.

300
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,328
Do you…

301
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,125
swear to stick together right to the end?

302
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,421
Just tell me that you will.

303
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,049
Okay. I promise you.

304
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,137
Together, you and I will get out of here.

305
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,775
What's your name, old man?

306
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,989
Why?

307
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,367
I just wanna know it.

308
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,083
Deok-su.

309
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,170
Jang Deok-su.

310
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,109
Deok-su.

311
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,156
You betray me…

312
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,118
I'll kill you, okay?

313
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,876
You're the reason that I think…

314
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,462
I might die tonight.

315
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,065
<i>Attention, staff,</i>
<i>it's now time for you to go to sleep.</i>

316
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,443
<i>Congratulations on a good day's work.</i>

317
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,708
SHAPES, RANK, MASKED LEADER,
GUN MASSACRE,

318
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:40,380
RIOT, ABETTING MURDER, MY BROTHER

319
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,610
<i>Morse code?</i>

320
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,951
<i>Number 29.</i>

321
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,976
Hey, old man.

322
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,186
Huh?

323
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,814
Did you stay up all night?

324
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,401
I thought they would attack again
or something.

325
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,112
Old man, but you must be
so exhausted already.

326
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,907
It's all right.

327
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,286
You don't really need that much sleep
when you're old.

328
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,916
And I didn't help
when they went after everyone

329
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,294
but keeping night watch,
well, I can do that.

330
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,052
<i>Attention, players.</i>
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

331
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,012
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

332
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,598
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

333
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,725
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

334
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,894
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

335
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,570
<i>Beginning head count now.</i>
<i>Please wait in front of your door.</i>

336
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,244
<i>Head count complete.</i>

337
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,471
<i>Players,</i>
<i>welcome to the third game.</i>

338
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>For this game, you will play in teams.</i>

339
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,729
<i>All players, please divide yourselves</i>
<i>into teams of ten people.</i>

340
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,317
<i>Your time limit will be ten minutes.</i>
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

341
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,112
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

342
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,281
<i>For this game, you will play in teams.</i>

343
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,203
<i>All players, please divide yourselves</i>
<i>into teams of ten people.</i>

344
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,124
<i>Your time limit will be ten minutes.</i>
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

345
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,794
We need to get a bunch of men
who are well built.

346
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,129
Oh, okay.

347
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,673
What about the girl?

348
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,562
Something that has teams of ten players.

349
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,148
So maybe it's Tail Tag
or Why Did You Come to My House?

350
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,651
Tail Tag means running is involved.

351
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,863
Or it might just end up
being simply based on luck.

352
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,741
What do you think?

353
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,703
Our team already has a girl
and an older guy.

354
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,372
I'm thinking we better get more men first.

355
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,918
What if they make us play <i>Gonggi</i>
or Elastics? Then, what do we do?

356
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,587
Girls are usually the good ones at that--

357
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,757
That's true, but when it really comes
down to it, usually men are better.

358
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,634
It's our lives we're betting on right now.

359
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,262
And we gotta win.

360
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,603
Five more people are needed.

361
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,481
I see that we each
bring one guy to join us.

362
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,732
Okay?

363
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,452
Don't let them see.

364
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,622
You'll seem weaker.

365
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,515
Boss, excuse me.
Look, this guy wants to join us.

366
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,142
Hey, go find more guys.

367
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,665
Sir?

368
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,000
Got a team yet? Are you taken?

369
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,335
Huh? Uh, no.

370
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,463
Come join ours then, sir. We have a team.

371
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,590
Well, the thing is, though,

372
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:39,178
so I can't join unless she does, too.

373
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,596
Would you let her?

374
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,224
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,351
Our team already has too many girls.

376
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,984
Excuse me. Still picking who to join in?
You should come with us.

377
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,368
Excuse me, sir.

378
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,832
If you're not on a team yet,
perhaps you would like to join ours?

379
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,389
<i>Let's team up next time.</i>

380
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,724
<i>Babe, wait!</i>

381
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,936
I don't get it.
Come on, you're just joking.

382
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,564
My team is full. I'm sorry.

383
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,192
We've got ten already.

384
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,864
Old man. No, please, you can't do this.

385
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,533
I'm sorry.

386
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,743
I'll do anything.

387
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,037
Babe, I swear I'll do better.

388
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,456
Uh, I'm good at everything.
You know that's true.

389
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,874
Just listen, okay?

390
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,211
Let's split up just for this game,
all right?

391
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,922
Then meet up with the next one, huh?

392
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,924
But…

393
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,384
do we really need to, though?

394
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,763
You said we'd do this together.

395
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,598
Babe.

396
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,975
Can you really do this alone?

397
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,646
I need you, old man. Can't you see that?

398
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,356
Get off!

399
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,692
God, this bitch is so pathetic.
Get your hands off me.

400
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,320
And stop calling me "babe"
and "old man," huh!

401
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,281
Call me that one more fucking time,
and I'll cut your goddamn throat out!

402
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,044
You asshole.

403
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,047
Just stop it. You were using me.

404
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
Jang Deok-su.

405
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,178
Goddamn you, scumbag.

406
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,474
You betrayed me,
you're dead now. Got that?

407
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,725
Oh, I'm so scared…

408
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,560
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.

409
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,939
Well then, best of luck to you, huh?

410
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,028
She's not worth it anyways.

411
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,076
What do you want?

412
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,661
Play with us.

413
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,251
One.

414
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,878
Two.

415
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,213
Three.

416
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
Four.

417
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,968
Five.

418
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,553
Six.

419
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,096
Seven.

420
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,140
Eight.

421
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,518
Nine? Um…

422
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,188
Wait, did someone not bring anyone?

423
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,440
It was me. I didn't.

424
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,486
What about you? Who brought you here?

425
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,822
Her.

426
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,660
I said to bring only men back here,
didn't I?

427
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,413
This doesn't sound good.

428
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,790
You want me to go?

429
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,542
I'll go now.

430
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,835
No, wait. Hold on.

431
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,755
It's okay. Stay where you are.

432
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,884
We don't even know what we're doing yet.

433
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,511
And the time's almost over.

434
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,182
At this point, let's just find
one more team and be done.

435
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,642
We put together a weak team,
who would want to join it?

436
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,437
That means that once the timer's done,

437
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,230
we'll end up with anyone
that got kicked out.

438
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,275
Well, nobody kicked me out, huh!

439
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,195
I'll play with you
as a special deal here, okay?

440
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,614
Man, you guys lucked out today. Yikes!

441
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,658
I'll be way more help
than either of these wimpy little girls.

442
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,788
Plus, I'm good at everything
except the things that I can't do.

443
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,294
<i>The time for forming your teams is over.</i>

444
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,339
<i>All players, please line up</i>
<i>with your teammates</i>

445
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,591
<i>-at the entrance to the game hall.</i>
-Hold on.

446
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,676
We're not gonna stay in here, though?

447
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,798
I would now like
to welcome you all to the third game.

448
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,343
Today's game is Tug-of-War.

449
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,597
In order to win, you must pull the rope
towards your platform

450
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,475
in an attempt to
drop your opponents down below.

451
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,698
Now, I will draw numbers to decide
which two teams will play first.

452
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,951
Everyone, please sit down.

453
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,710
First, the team
that will play on the left tower.

454
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,550
Team One. Team One, please stand up.

455
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,057
And now, the team that will play
on the right tower.

456
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,312
Team Seven.

457
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,481
Team Seven, please stand up.

458
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,326
Teams One and Seven
will be the first teams to play.

459
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,872
Will both teams please go to your towers.

460
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,058
Get them!

461
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,023
Oh! Oh, shit!

462
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,528
Shit!

463
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,576
Get them!

464
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>The following players, Player 245,</i>

465
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,375
<i>Player 120, Player 37, Player 408,</i>

466
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,963
<i>Player 27, Player 273, Player 58,</i>

467
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:59,470
<i>Player 243, Player 327,</i>
<i>and Player 241 are eliminated.</i>

468
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,926
I will now draw
the teams for the next round.

469
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,968
Team Four.

470
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,557
Team Five.

471
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,905
Damn it.

472
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,032
All men.

473
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,868
Team Four and Team Five,
please go to your towers.

474
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,921
Oh, man. I was looking forward
to killing you guys.

475
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,094
Come on. Don't lose your spirit.

476
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:09,099
Tug-of-War needs more
than just raw strength.

477
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,478
Well then, what it's about, huh?
We just go out and speak to them?

478
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,564
All you need is a good strategy
in Tug-of-War

479
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,191
and combined with good teamwork,

480
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,319
you'll be able to win
when you are against stronger teams.

481
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,446
Only one thing can help us now.

482
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,281
It's the Lord himself, I know it.

483
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,533
You can barely stay standing, old man.

484
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,869
So shut up and keep
all your strength, okay?

485
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,165
Wait a minute,
let's hear what the old man says.

486
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,837
Okay, when I was young,
we always like Tug-of-War.

487
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,923
It's a game I know well.

488
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:44,092
And back then, I would always win,

489
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,972
<i>even if there was a wrestler</i>
<i>on the other team,</i>

490
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,643
<i>and it seemed the odds</i>
<i>were stuck against us.</i>

491
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,105
<i>Listen closely,</i>

492
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:01,193
<i>and I'll tell you how my team and I</i>
<i>were able to win</i>

493
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,612
<i>even when it seemed impossible.</i>

494
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:11,161
<i>First off, having a good leader</i>
<i>is very important.</i>

495
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,872
<i>The person is at the front</i>

496
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,709
<i>and keeps an eye on</i>
<i>how the other team is performing.</i>

497
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,839
<i>And the rest of the team focuses</i>
<i>on the back of their leader's head</i>

498
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,465
<i>and follows their lead.</i>

499
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,845
<i>If the leader seems weak or looks like</i>
<i>their spirit is beginning to falter,</i>

500
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,848
<i>then the game is already over.</i>

501
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,060
<i>And then at the end of the rope,</i>

502
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,272
<i>you'll need to have someone strong</i>
<i>and dependable</i>

503
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,940
<i>like the anchor of a ship.</i>

504
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:45,445
<i>After that, it's all about</i>
<i>how you arrange the rest of your team.</i>

505
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,198
<i>If one player is</i>
<i>on the right side of the rope,</i>

506
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,494
<i>then the next one should be on the left,</i>
<i>all the way down the rope.</i>

507
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,959
<i>Both of your feet</i>
<i>should be facing straight forward,</i>

508
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,421
<i>and then, hold the rope in your armpits.</i>

509
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,758
<i>That way, everyone can put in</i>
<i>all of their strength.</i>

510
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:12,180
<i>Finally, and this is absolutely</i>
<i>the most important thing.</i>

511
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,184
<i>Once the game begins,</i>
<i>for the first ten seconds…</i>

512
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,271
<i>…you have to hold your ground.</i>

513
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,317
<i>You should lean back,</i>
<i>practically lie down.</i>

514
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,154
<i>Push your lower abdomen up to the sky,</i>
<i>as hard as you can.</i>

515
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,823
<i>And throw your head back to the point</i>

516
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,410
<i>where you can almost see the groin</i>
<i>of the person behind you.</i>

517
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:38,248
<i>If you do that, the other team</i>
<i>won't be able to pull us to their side.</i>

518
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,209
<i>Just hold like this for ten seconds.</i>

519
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,047
<i>Then the opposing team</i>
<i>will start to get frustrated</i>

520
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,008
<i>because they are thinking,</i>
<i>"Why won't they budge?"</i>

521
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,845
<i>Because they believed</i>
<i>that they were much stronger.</i>

522
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,765
<i>If you can hold out for that long,</i>

523
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,852
<i>you will be able to catch a moment</i>
<i>in your opponents' hold,</i>

524
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,313
<i>and their rhythm breaks.</i>

525
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,441
Now's our chance!

526
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,216
Pull it together!

527
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,744
We're losing! Goddamn it! Do something!

528
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,335
Get yourselves together and listen!

529
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,839
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

530
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,800
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

531
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,802
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

532
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,345
There's no way I'll do that!

533
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,805
We might as well try!

534
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,557
No way! I can't do it!

535
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,225
Move up or you'll die!

536
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,977
On count of three!

537
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,895
One! Two!

538
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,689
Three!
