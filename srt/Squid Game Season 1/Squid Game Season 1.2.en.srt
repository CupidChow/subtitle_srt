EPISODE 2
HELL

2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,921
Sang-woo.

3
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,966
You helped me. Thank you.

4
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,640
And you did too.

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,268
You saved my life out there.

6
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,439
You're alive. That is what matters.

7
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,747
You have all made it
through the first game.

8
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,082
Congratulations.

9
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,166
You're moving on.

10
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,002
I will now announce the results
of the first game.

11
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,600
Out of 456 players,
255 were eliminated,

12
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,854
and 201 players successfully
completed the first game.

13
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,819
Mister, please.

14
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,530
Listen. I'm so sorry.

15
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,282
I swear I will pay what I owe.

16
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:41,077
I'll do it, I'll pay it all.

17
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,496
Please, sir.

18
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,999
I have a child.

19
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,042
Oh! So young,

20
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,463
I need to register,
and I still need to name my child, sir.

21
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,760
-Please, sir, let me leave.
-Please. I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,014
Sir, I'm begging you.
Let me leave and I swear

23
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,516
I'll find a way to pay it all.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,934
-Let me go home.
-Me too.

25
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,188
I can't keep going.
Sir, please, I can't go on.

26
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,191
Please let me go home.

27
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,277
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,655
We are not trying to hurt you
or collect your debts.

29
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,868
Let me remind you
that we're here to give you a chance.

30
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,952
A chance?

31
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,913
We play some kids games.

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,374
And you shoot us.
You want me to choose that?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,460
That's some chance.

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,837
We may be in debt, sir…

35
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,756
…but that doesn't justify killing us all.

36
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,217
This is just a game.

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,635
Killing everyone out there was a…

38
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,511
game to you, huh?

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,556
They were simply eliminated
for breaking the rules of the game.

40
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,850
If you just follow the rules,

41
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,604
you can leave this place safely
with the prize money we promised.

42
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,065
Just keep your damn money. I don't care!

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,944
Let me just go home. That's all I want.

44
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,488
Let us leave. Let us go.

45
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,990
Consent form clause 1.

46
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,493
A player is not allowed to stop playing.

47
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,204
Come on! You think
you'll get away with this, huh?

48
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,414
The police will come.

49
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,460
They'll bust in here any minute now.
They'll be here since we all disappeared.

50
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,254
Yeah.

51
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,467
And I bet they have
everybody's phones tracked here already.

52
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,345
Look at all your hostages.
You're doomed if you don't let us go!

53
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,346
We're all dead!

54
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,522
Consent form clause 2.

55
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,567
A player who refuses to play
will be eliminated.

56
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,987
Consent form clause 3.

57
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,490
If all the players agreed to stop playing,

58
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,701
the games are allowed to end.

59
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,369
Or am I wrong?

60
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,458
You are correct.

61
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,004
So let's vote on ending this.

62
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,132
If the majority wishes
to leave this place,

63
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,551
then everyone gets to go home, right?

64
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,597
All right, as you wish.

65
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,559
We will take a vote to decide
on the termination of the game.

66
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,064
Before we vote,

67
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,110
let me announce the prize money
for the game as previously promised.

68
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,744
A total of 255 players
were eliminated during the first game.

69
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,413
A hundred million won
is at stake per player.

70
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,668
Therefore, 25,5 billion won of prize money
has been accumulated so far.

71
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,130
If you wish to give up on playing,
the 25,5 billion won

72
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,966
will be sent to the bereaved families
of the late players,

73
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,426
100 million won each.

74
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,930
However, you will all return home
empty-handed.

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,100
Uh, sir…

76
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,105
So then, if we can complete all six games,

77
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
how much do we get?

78
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,984
Since there were 456 players,

79
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,154
the total prize money is 45,6 billion won.

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,616
And with that,
we will now begin the voting.

81
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,788
As you can see,
there are two buttons in front of you.

82
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,542
If you wish to continue playing,
press the green button with an O.

83
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,252
If you wish to stop playing,

84
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,130
then please press the red button
with the X instead.

85
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,090
After you finish voting,

86
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,717
move to the other side
of the white line and wait.

87
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,513
Voting will be done in reverse order
of the numbers on your chests.

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,850
Player 456, please cast your vote.

89
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,716
Player 453, please cast your vote.

90
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,983
Come on.

91
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,193
Player 218.

92
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,763
Have you all gone crazy?

93
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,682
We have to leave.

94
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,350
We can't keep putting up
with this insanity.

95
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,060
So what if we leave?

96
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,813
Tell me, what changes?

97
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,067
Just as bad out there
as it is in here, goddamn it.

98
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,236
She's right!

99
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,407
If we stop right now,
that only helps the ones who are dead.

100
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,326
They'll get a 100 million won and not us.

101
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,329
We made it through! They're out!
That money is ours.

102
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,374
Please! Think about
what just happened out there.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,585
Come on, let's go!

104
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,837
Where am I supposed to go, huh?

105
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,424
Out there, I don't stand a chance.
I do in here.

106
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,218
No, I've got nothing out there.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,430
Come on, let's finish this thing!

108
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,975
I'd rather stay and keep on trying in here
than go back to the bullshit out there.

109
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,270
You jerk! You got some kind of death wish?
Go die alone!

110
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,355
Don't drag everybody else
into this, you little shit!

111
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,190
-What the hell are you doing?
-Who are you--

112
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,947
We will not condone any kind of act

113
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,366
that impedes this democratic process.

114
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,412
Now, let us resume and continue voting.

115
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,075
It seems we're down to the last vote.

116
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
Player 1.

117
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,857
<i>The doctor said there's a…</i>

118
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,027
a lump inside over here,
growing every day.

119
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,821
<i>Brain tumor.</i>

120
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,792
If you wish to continue playing, press O.

121
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,587
However, if you wish to stop playing,
then press X.

122
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,249
The majority of the
players have voted to terminate the game.

123
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,835
Therefore, this game is now terminated.

124
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,171
Hey! Okay, anybody who wants, they can go.

125
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,965
But let the ones who want,
stay till the end, though.

126
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,009
<i>Half of us has died already!</i>

127
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,385
<i>We can't just stop here!</i>

128
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,554
<i>He's right!</i>
<i>Please let us stay!</i>

129
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,307
<i>-We'll keep playing the game!</i>
-<i>Yes! Let us continue!</i>

130
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,352
It truly is a pity
that we must say goodbye to you like this.

131
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,689
However, we will not completely
seal the door of opportunity

132
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,648
for all of you.

133
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,319
If the majority of you
wish to participate again,

134
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,529
then we will resume the game.

135
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,283
So, goodbye for now.

136
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,506
Oh, help! Help! Hello!

137
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,716
Help over here! I can't see anything!

138
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,468
-Will you shut up?
-Huh?

139
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,435
Who are you?

140
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,481
-The pickpocket? You're the thief.
-Oh, shut up.

141
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,566
-Is that you, huh?
-You plan on lying here all night?

142
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,527
-Come on now. Untie me, you moron.
-Huh?

143
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,785
Hang on.

144
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,620
Oh, shit. Where are we?

145
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,332
Hey. Untie me now. Hey!

146
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,253
What are you… Oh, okay.

147
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,296
Get dressed first. It's cold.

148
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,423
I'm freezing too. Oh!

149
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,883
Oh, yeah.

150
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,301
Hurry up now.

151
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,805
Oh, that hurts. Hey.

152
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,518
Hey, stop. Come on, it's my turn now.
Huh? Hey!

153
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,938
Wait! Wait. What are you doing?
You gotta untie me.

154
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,024
Yeah, why is that?

155
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,609
I just helped you. What the hell?

156
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,238
Now, aren't you a little old
to be this clueless?

157
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,115
I help untie you,

158
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,409
then you're just gonna hassle me
for your cash again.

159
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,286
Of course, I'm gonna hassle you.

160
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
Okay, fine.

161
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,874
Forget the money, okay?
Untie me, I beg you.

162
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,752
Seriously?

163
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,339
Yeah. I swear I'll forget the whole thing.

164
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,674
How can I trust you?

165
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,553
I swear it on my… on my own mother, okay?

166
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,512
Pretty please.

167
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,556
Oh, it's freezing. Goddamn it!

168
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,183
That hurts. Shit.

169
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,942
Hey, you little… Come here. Get back here.

170
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,570
My money… give it back. Give it back now!

171
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,530
Give it back!

172
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,074
Give me my money! Give it back! Ow!

173
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,660
Oh, shit. Give me back the money.

174
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,955
That's all your mother means to you.

175
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,293
You little… Hold on,
you stop right there. Hey!

176
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,630
Hey! Don't walk away!

177
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,632
God, shit.

178
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,018
Excuse me, sir, where are we?

179
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,191
Yeouido.

180
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,820
Where exactly is… Yeouido?

181
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,035
In the center of Seoul.

182
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,834
Uh… sir, sir,
do you have a cell phone on you?

183
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,921
Uh, would you let me borrow it, please?

184
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,881
I'll be quick.

185
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,308
That's 2,000 won.

186
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,360
CYBER POLICE: SUBPOENA
HAS BEEN SENT.

187
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
SANG-WOO, CALL US NOW
AND WE WON'T SUE.

188
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,113
MR. CHO SANG-WOO,
YOUR LOANS ARE…

189
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,030
SEOUL POLICE:
YOU ARE TO ATTEND AT ONCE.

190
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,299
Thank you, sir.

191
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,306
Hello?

192
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,017
Hi.

193
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,644
Yes, I had some work.

194
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,147
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,947
Here you go.
And thanks again, sir.

196
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
Have a good night.

197
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,412
Wait. Stop.

198
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,497
Got money for the bus?

199
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,457
Sorry?

200
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,167
You said you live in Ansan.

201
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,420
You couldn't afford the <i>ramyeon</i> here.
Got money for the ride back?

202
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,548
-Money.
-No. No money.

203
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,924
I'll walk.

204
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,470
You'll walk… all the way to Ansan?

205
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,109
Here, take this for the bus ride home.

206
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,528
I can't. No.

207
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,364
I don't have money to pay you back.

208
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,868
I won't ask you to do that. Take it, okay?

209
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,255
Thank you.

210
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,673
Thank you so much, sir.

211
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,886
Listen, I'm not your sir,
so stop calling me that.

212
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,429
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,932
Thank you.

214
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,645
Thank you so much.

215
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,148
Look, officer.

216
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,692
You've gotta realize
what a massive deal all of this was.

217
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,236
I know it sounds crazy.

218
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,487
Okay, sir.

219
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,532
So you're saying that your kidnappers

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,868
rounded up hundreds of people
and had them play a game.

221
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,870
Then went out there
and shot the ones who lost.

222
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,247
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

223
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,165
And they didn't just shoot one or two.

224
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,960
Those people had no mercy.
They killed more than 200!

225
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,044
What game was it then?

226
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,587
You know Red Light, Green Light?

227
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,714
Wait, that's for kids.

228
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,675
-Is that what they made you play?
-Yes.

229
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,302
-And they forced adults to do it?
-I know how it sounds.

230
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,012
And then they shot everyone
who got caught?

231
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,722
How many more times
do you want me to say it?

232
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,765
Mister.

233
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,143
So where did they do it?
Where's the place they were killed?

234
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,436
They had me knocked unconscious,
so how could I know?

235
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,021
I said I don't have any freaking clue.

236
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
Then give us the killer's description.

237
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,817
They all had these masks on
the whole time we were there.

238
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,569
Then, wait,
how did you manage to get out?

239
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,406
Hey, look, the players came together
and put it to a vote.

240
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,492
-And since the majority wanted to leave--
-Hold on, okay?

241
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,161
You said you wanted to stop playing,

242
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,122
and the killers, they told you,
"Sure, you can go." Just like that?

243
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,708
Yeah.

244
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,002
And what made you want to go there?

245
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,589
Well, they…

246
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,343
-they promised we would get money, so…
-Money?

247
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,430
Yeah.

248
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,515
We're talking tens of billions of won.

249
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,353
Okay. Let me just sum up
everything you've told us so far.

250
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,521
Just so I understand.

251
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,689
You went to play kids' games

252
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,774
because someone told you
you'd get all that cash.

253
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,902
So then they had you play
some Red Light, Green Light,

254
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,737
and they shot everyone who got caught.

255
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,489
But when you said you wanted to go,
they said, "Okay, just go,"

256
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,743
and you don't know what they look like
or where this all took place.

257
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,077
Is that everything, mister?

258
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,788
Yeah.

259
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,041
What's your name, sir?

260
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,710
I live in Ssangmun-dong.
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

261
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,088
Seong Gi-hun, you got someone
who's taking care of you?

262
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,134
If you want me to help, we can call around
and get you to a local medical center.

263
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,302
What do you take me for?

264
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,930
Look, I'm a tax-paying citizen
of Ssangmun-dong. Got it?

265
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,141
Here's their number.
It's on a business card.

266
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,185
Call and see what they say! Jeez!

267
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,965
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Uh…

268
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,094
Hello, yes, sorry for bothering you.
Uh, my bad.

269
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,680
Um, would you mind if I ask you something?

270
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,806
<i>Who is this?</i>

271
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,391
-Well, I…
-Hey, you're not a cop, okay?

272
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,018
Uh… Uh, sorry to call so early.

273
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,606
Could I come play in those games there?

274
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,817
<i>Games?</i>

275
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,404
Uh, yeah. See,
games are my thing, you know.

276
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,114
I'll play all the games you ask me to.

277
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,865
-I'll do the best--
-<i>Okay. Hold on.</i>

278
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,827
<i>Who the heck are you?</i>

279
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,288
<i>And why are you calling me this early</i>
<i>with this nonsense?</i>

280
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,666
<i>If you wanna play games,</i>
<i>go to an Internet cafe.</i>

281
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,668
<i>What's wrong with you,</i>
<i>you freaking pervert?</i>

282
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,928
You dialed
the wrong number! Let go!

283
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,389
-Officer, don't do this. Please.
-We're sorry, mister. You better go home.

284
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,642
You sure you dialed the right number, huh?
Better be sure you did!

285
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,812
You'll see.
Look, I'll call and put you on the line.

286
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,565
The right number's on my phone
from the call that I made already.

287
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,774
Fuck this guy.

288
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,077
<i>I'm sorry. The number</i>
<i>that you have dialed does not exist</i>

289
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,954
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

290
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,999
<i>Please check the number</i>
<i>and try again later.</i>

291
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,250
<i>Please check the number…</i>

292
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,879
Who was that? Was he drunk?

293
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,714
Some crazy hobo guy.

294
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,799
Everything's crazy around here today.

295
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,968
You, get a grip. Wanna go back in?

296
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,891
Well, I'm out. Have a good one.

297
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,353
Here. Goodbye.

298
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,860
Hey, Ma.

299
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,864
It's your son.

300
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,494
Hmm.

301
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,373
Ma?

302
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,505
Where are you?

303
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,970
<i>The person you are trying</i>
<i>to reach is currently unavailable.</i>

304
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,265
Where'd you go?
You left the door open and everything.

305
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,318
Sang-woo.

306
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,864
What are you doing here?

307
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,128
Is it because of your debt?

308
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,464
Shh…

309
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,635
Hey, come on, you're still
Ssangmun-dong's own pride and joy.

310
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,472
You're still the genius who got accepted
to SNU Business School. So don't worry.

311
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,598
You'll make money again.

312
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,643
Go tell your mom all about it
and make a fresh start.

313
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,980
Just make…

314
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,691
six billion won?

315
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,818
Six billion?

316
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,280
I thought it was 600 million won.

317
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,116
They don't know everything there is.

318
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,745
And all those stocks that guy said
that you lost, you did that for real?

319
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,789
It wasn't just stocks now.

320
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,335
There was futures too.

321
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,462
Excuse me?

322
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,006
You bet on your future?

323
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,718
What kind of bet was it
that you used that much money?

324
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,763
-Did you get a girlfriend?
-Doesn't mean that future.

325
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,809
Just forget it.

326
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,650
Hey, file for personal bankruptcy then.

327
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,569
Whatever they call it.

328
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,280
I heard you won't have to pay
your debts off if you do that.

329
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,949
I used my own mother's house
as financial collateral.

330
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,493
And her shop.

331
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,454
I put it all on the line.

332
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,882
Who is this?

333
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,929
Yeah, this is he.

334
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,558
What?

335
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,560
24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

336
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,855
-Oh.
-She's diabetic.

337
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,652
She left it untreated, and it got worse.

338
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,073
She had to be in a lot of pain recently.
You didn't know?

339
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,117
Will you be able to treat her for it?

340
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,829
In the worst case,
she might need to have her feet amputated.

341
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,459
Let's keep her here for now
and see how things go with treatment.

342
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,009
Ma.

343
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,057
Ma!

344
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,018
Mom, where are you going?

345
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,437
He said you need to stay here.

346
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,522
I'm okay.

347
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,816
But you're not okay.

348
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,110
Hey, Mom, you can't walk around like that.

349
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,112
Look, just stop it.

350
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,239
You haven't been home in days now,

351
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,533
out doing whatever it is
you're doing lately,

352
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,660
but now you're a good son, huh?

353
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,579
Mom, don't be like this, okay?

354
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,581
You know how bad this thing could get?

355
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,835
Tell me. Say I stay here
and they treat me,

356
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,337
who's going to pay the rent in that case?

357
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,009
Also, do you know how much it costs
to be in the hospital,

358
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,886
not to mention how much all the drugs are?

359
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,638
The insurance will help pay for them.

360
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,516
Insurance? Help us?

361
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,435
You canceled all that.

362
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,064
Remember, you ended it
and used up all the cash we had.

363
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,734
Will you please just get a grip?

364
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,360
Goodness.

365
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,072
Gi-hun.

366
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,409
Let's stop. I'm too tired.

367
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,998
I'm too tired to go on.
Stop arguing with me.

368
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,208
Let's end this.

369
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,634
Damn it. I'll get what you need.

370
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,428
I'll get all the money you need.

371
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,684
Hello, Ma.

372
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,022
Heading over to his apartment right now.

373
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm sure he's fine, okay?

374
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,613
He dodges our calls all the time.
You know what he's like.

375
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,702
I can call everyone who might know places
he's hold up in before.

376
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,455
If I can't reach him then,

377
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,500
then I'll go report him missing tomorrow.

378
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,672
I'm a police officer.
Have you forgotten that?

379
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,965
I will find him.

380
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,927
Yes, Mom.
Don't worry too much.

381
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,473
How long
has it been since he came by?

382
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,185
Well, I don't bother tenants every day.

383
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,021
Still, I mean,
his rent was due a week ago.

384
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,524
I've stopped by every day since then,

385
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,027
he was never here, though,
and never picked up his phone.

386
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,780
There.

387
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,908
That's right.
Think you could pay his rent?

388
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,038
Otherwise, you'll have to come
move all of his things out.

389
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,584
I'll take a look now
and pay his rent later.

390
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,506
Well, I'll be down the hall.

391
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,605
THEORY OF DESIRE, JACQUES LACAN
RENÉ MAGRITTE

392
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,593
<i>Was he drunk?</i>

393
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,636
Some crazy hobo guy.

394
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,305
Everything's crazy
around here today.

395
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,937
Hey, I got ice cream, everyone.

396
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,990
What? No ice cream for you, little man?

397
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,290
How did you get your face like that?

398
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you get into a fight?

399
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,673
If you're not gonna talk to me,

400
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,050
I guess I'll just go.

401
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,891
Wait. I don't wanna stay here, okay?

402
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,812
Where's Mom? You said she would come soon.

403
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,190
You told me that we'd be together.

404
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,692
that I just had to wait a month.

405
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,489
Cheol.

406
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,660
-Listen--
-All the kids told me you lied.

407
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,912
They said I'd never leave and…

408
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,332
They said I'd get abandoned here.

409
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,754
They're wrong.

410
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,508
And Mom and Dad will be here soon.

411
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,470
I swear, okay?
I'll make sure that they do.

412
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,519
Don't worry. Listen, we'll all live
under the same roof next year, okay?

413
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,440
I'm your big sis.

414
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,735
I always keep my word, don't I?

415
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:16,791
Ah, you mean the stupid game guy?
That guy?

416
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,168
What do you need his name for,
Detective Hwang?

417
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,671
I saw that he looked familiar to me.

418
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,465
I think I know the guy
like to a family friend or something.

419
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,466
Really?

420
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,135
Let me think about it.

421
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,347
-Something like Saeng or Seong or--
-Seong Gi-hun.

422
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,475
-Ssangmun-dong is where he lives, right?
-You're right. Seong Gi-hun.

423
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,810
Is he your friend?

424
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,229
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

425
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,150
Uh, and how about getting his address too?

426
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,615
Hey, Ali! Long time no see!

427
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,250
-Hey, Ali.
-Why won't you answer my calls?

428
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,668
You called, huh?

429
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
And now you're here.

430
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,755
What's up?
Is something wrong?

431
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,341
Sir, stop. Pay what you owe me now.

432
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,970
Yeah. Don't you remember?

433
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,098
I told you, I've got no money.
Business isn't going so well.

434
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,434
Look at what working here
did to my body, sir.

435
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,978
I couldn't afford the hospital either.

436
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,688
Now look here, I gotta go.

437
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,815
-Give me the wages you owe.
-Damn it.

438
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,401
Go and ask the rest of my employees
if they got their paychecks yet.

439
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,362
I can't pay anyone till I get the cash!

440
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,698
Hey, I got pain everywhere, Ali.

441
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,618
I'm so damn broke. I need a doctor.

442
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,912
You said you would pay us.
Where did it all go?

443
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,914
-Six whole months…
-Come on.

444
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,707
…and nothing
for all our hard work out there.

445
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,376
Hey, you little son of a…

446
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,297
Hah! I'm busy now. We'll talk later.

447
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,596
Sir, give me my paycheck.

448
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,099
Sir, please give me my money back.

449
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,725
You little shit, don't touch me.

450
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,811
Don't swear at me!

451
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,273
I saw you have money.

452
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,775
-Shut up!
-My money!

453
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,235
Give it to me!

454
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,529
Let me go, son of a bitch!

455
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,155
Give me my money!

456
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,158
What did you do, Ali?

457
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,077
Stop that. Hey!

458
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,206
Shit!

459
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,874
Hey, you can't just leave!

460
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,170
SOUTHERN MEN, NORTHERN WOMEN

461
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,050
I completely understand
what your situation is like.

462
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,803
But you know, it's…

463
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,598
A broker can't be tracked down
once they've fled with all of their money.

464
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,976
You aren't the only victim.

465
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,355
There's some who went all the way
to Dandong to try and catch this one guy,

466
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,858
they got caught by the Chinese police,

467
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,277
almost got dragged all the way back North.

468
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,612
My options, what are they? What do I do?

469
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,743
Get another broker and try it all again.

470
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,037
And I'm sure you already know,

471
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,832
but you're going to need
to start the process over again.

472
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,084
How much is it?

473
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,922
We're gonna start by finding out
your parents location again.

474
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,968
And security around the border
is now much tighter,

475
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,637
so the price for helping them
cross the river shot up.

476
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,181
So how much then?

477
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,393
So you'll want…

478
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,189
at least 40 million.

479
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,317
Forty million.

480
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,070
You're only paying
to get them to China, though.

481
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,863
If you want to get them to the South then…

482
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,784
That burns! Oh, that's fucking hot.

483
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,328
Damn it.

484
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,580
I trusted you and brought my money here
like you told me.

485
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,001
That money is something
I risked my own life to get.

486
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,712
Hey. Uh…

487
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,340
I had no idea.

488
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,344
I didn't know those people
would just run off with all your money.

489
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,720
Please, I swear.

490
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,141
Sure.

491
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,560
I'll get your money.

492
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,773
You pull anything on me…

493
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,526
…I'll rip your fucking throat wide open,
and that's that.

494
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,945
You got it?

495
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,093
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

496
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,720
So,
have you been eating all right over there?

497
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,849
<i>Yes, I've been eating well,</i>
<i>so don't worry.</i>

498
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,936
I doubt that greasy American food
is doing all that much for you.

499
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,438
-Tell me what you're eating.
-<i>It's okay, Mom.</i>

500
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,357
<i>There are lots of Korean restaurants.</i>

501
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,819
Oh, really? That's great.

502
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,362
So when are you coming back?

503
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,491
<i>Uh, it's taking longer than expected,</i>
<i>so I'm not sure.</i>

504
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,327
-<i>It might be a while.</i>
-Oh, really?

505
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,037
It sure sounds like it's been tough there.

506
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,998
Hey, Mom.

507
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,958
<i>Yes? What?</i>

508
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>Excuse me. Hi.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

509
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,674
I'll take three squids,
prepped and cleaned.

510
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,301
Ah, yes. Wait just a minute.

511
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,802
Sang-woo, there's a customer here.

512
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,847
<i>Don't bring me</i>
<i>back anything from your trip.</i>

513
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,433
<i>I don't need anything over here, okay?</i>

514
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,976
-Okay.
<i>-My goodness.</i>

515
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,769
<i>I'm just worried that you might get me,</i>

516
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,147
<i>you know, something that's really</i>
<i>way too expensive.</i>

517
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,525
<i>All right, honey, you should go.</i>
<i>I love you, Sang-woo.</i>

518
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,528
<i>You wanted a squid--</i>

519
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,504
Oh, he always gets me a little something

520
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,675
whenever he goes on one of his trips,
he takes for work. Ah!

521
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,553
A gentleman too. Sounds amazing.

522
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,680
He went to SNU.

523
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,516
For Business.

524
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,978
Come on, Business at SNU?

525
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,565
And he's not just smart,
he's handsome too.

526
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,650
Is he married yet?

527
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,401
Not yet. He's single.

528
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,653
How old is he?

529
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,196
I know someone he might like.

530
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,157
Well, the man's standards
are set pretty high.

531
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,452
Hi there. Excuse me.

532
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,248
Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo's mother?

533
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,376
Uh, yeah. Cho Sang-woo.
Yes, he's my son, sir.

534
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,294
Do you know where your son
happens to be now?

535
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,588
On business in the United States. Uh…

536
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,174
-Why do you ask, sir?
-Well, we're the police.

537
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,428
I'm afraid that Mr. Cho Sang-woo
has a warrant out for his arrest.

538
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,556
He's charged with forgery,
embezzlement, crimes that are all…

539
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,267
some form of financial fraud.

540
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,977
Huh?

541
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,438
No, you can't be right.

542
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,028
Uh, no, detectives. You know what,
you know what, there's a mistake.

543
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,532
I know that my son
wouldn't do anything illegal. So…

544
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,368
Listen, I'm sure you love him a lot.

545
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,162
If he contacts you,
just tell him to come to us.

546
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,331
If he keeps avoiding us like this,

547
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,542
when they put him on trial,
it's gonna look bad.

548
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,287
Who is it?

549
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,254
Hmm?

550
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,232
TIME: MIDNIGHT, JUNE 23
PLACE: SAME AS PREVIOUS

551
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,580
Where did you get this money?

552
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,542
Ali, where did you get this money?

553
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,295
Listen carefully.

554
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,799
Buy tickets for the earliest flight
for you and our kid and go home first.

555
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,885
-What about you?
-You two should go first.

556
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,513
I'll be there
as soon as my job here is done.

557
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,976
Something is going on with you, right?

558
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,769
Don't ask anything for now.

559
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,481
You need to pack up and leave right away.

560
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,776
I hope you can understand my problem.

561
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,280
I love you. You and our child.

562
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,077
I don't have any money.

563
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,328
HEALING PUB

564
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,539
Just lend me
three million won, please.

565
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,207
I'll pay it all back.

566
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,877
Friends shouldn't talk
to each other like this.

567
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,045
You know how strapped for cash
we both are.

568
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,798
I know that. Of course.

569
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,718
You think I'm happy
asking you for cash, huh?

570
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,679
Look, I'll come
and make deliveries for you, okay?

571
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,891
I'm not paying for delivery man right now.
Look at my bar.

572
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,642
Just the rent is too much.

573
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,772
I'll pay you in a month, okay? Huh?

574
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,526
I'll continue my chauffeuring
and come help around here.

575
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,695
Listen.

576
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,615
They told me she needs
to get surgery right away.

577
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,783
Hey, honey.

578
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,994
You should get back in here, okay?

579
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,496
I will soon.

580
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,041
Get in here right now, okay?
And put that out.

581
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,968
Hello.

582
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,013
-Gi-hun.
-Yeah?

583
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,141
Coming out to someone's nice pub
and smoking outside is rude.

584
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,561
Oh, yeah.

585
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,008
Wait.

586
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,803
Aren't you…

587
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,853
Oh, it's a small world.

588
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,855
It's you.

589
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,651
-You are Player 456, right?
-Uh, yeah.

590
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,069
I'm, um…

591
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,238
-That's me. Yeah.
-What are the chances?

592
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,657
So then, what are you doing around here?

593
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,576
Actually, I live right down the road.

594
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,369
Oh.

595
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,537
I see.

596
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,830
-And you?
-Ah.

597
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,999
You come from around this area as well?

598
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,792
Uh, no.

599
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,588
I have a friend who lives nearby. So…

600
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,301
There isn't anywhere
for this old man to go.

601
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,846
I'm just staying there for a while.

602
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,724
-Uh, goodness.
-Uh…

603
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,560
-Would you like to sit down?
-Sure.

604
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,440
What are the odds you're here
at the same time as me?

605
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,400
What are the odds, right?

606
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,193
You know I think…

607
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,113
that we were destined to meet here.

608
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,118
Uh, would you like a little?

609
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,037
Mm. Sure.

610
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,663
Uh…

611
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,791
Is your head okay?
Are you allowed to drink?

612
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,668
It's all right.

613
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,888
Uh, sorry. I wish I have some food
for the two of us.

614
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,139
Ah.

615
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,224
It's okay.

616
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,075
Oh, hey, hold on.

617
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,911
You're absolutely sure
you could have this much?

618
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,246
-I mean, you had a lot of already.
-Mm-hm.

619
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,546
I…

620
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,717
decided to going again.

621
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,594
Hmm. Go where?

622
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,769
You're going there?

623
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,482
Since my…

624
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,443
time's almost out as it is.

625
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,569
I don't want…

626
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,781
to sit around waiting to die.

627
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,199
That sounds pathetic.

628
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,285
And who knows

629
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,249
I still could go and win the whole thing.

630
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,335
When we played Red Light, Green Light,

631
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,005
I got to the line even before you did.

632
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,674
How could you wanna go there?

633
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,261
But as soon as I got back here,

634
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:28,016
I got some harsh reminders.
Yeah, what they say is true.

635
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,855
Out here, the torture is worse.

636
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,620
Hey, boss!

637
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,749
What took you so long?

638
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,959
All these stupid drunks
got into a huge fight

639
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,003
as I was about to leave the bar
and head here.

640
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,547
Ah, you know how it goes.

641
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,675
Something about a Friday night
always brings out the weirdos.

642
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,761
-The money?
-Oh.

643
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,182
I couldn't get more on short notice.

644
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,476
I'll make sure the rest
will come in soon, okay?

645
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,646
And anyways, the Big Boss sent out
all the boys to find you

646
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,191
Incheon and Ilsan,
the whole damn place had eyes.

647
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,068
Where have you been hiding?

648
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,238
We better not discuss that out here.
Did you drive here?

649
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,033
Yeah, this way.

650
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:36,210
So this is the invitation from that whole
Red Light, Green Light game, huh?

651
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,628
Yeah.

652
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,130
This one came yesterday.

653
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,508
They're starting up again.

654
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:48,096
So then, we go on Tuesday.
Gather all the boys and meet us there.

655
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,307
Get some guns for us too.

656
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,727
-Guns?
-They've got guns, yeah.

657
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,355
Still, the pickup is only one guy.

658
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,483
We'll beat up those masked shitheads,

659
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,819
and then we break in
and take all the cash.

660
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,405
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
how much of that is true?

661
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,201
You bastard. Come on,
tell me what you're getting at.

662
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,703
Sorry, boss.

663
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,543
So they've got tens of billions of won
up in a huge piggy bank up there.

664
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,504
As long as we hit them
with everything we got,

665
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:24,716
no more dealing with those stupid drunks
at bars to make barely anything, assholes.

666
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,511
Uh, boss, hold on.

667
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,975
All the guys… you went into hiding
because you mess with the Big Boss.

668
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,519
At this point, all of Incheon knows.

669
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,521
Ahh!

670
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,315
I doubt I'd be able to convince anyone.

671
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,817
Hey, look here, you jerk.

672
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,194
We're gonna do this
so I can get the money I owe him.

673
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,197
So…

674
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,743
in the Philippines, how did you lose
so much money at the casino?

675
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,830
How did you know that?

676
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,749
Boss, you should've known not to go
pushing your luck, you know.

677
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,293
You little piece of shit.

678
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,174
Deok-su.

679
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,301
"Deok-su"?

680
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,516
The guys from the casino
came here looking for you.

681
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,563
They'll take your liver, your kidneys,
and your eyes for the money you owe.

682
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,233
And now you're gonna die,
you fucking asshole!

683
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,175
Hey! Welcome to Korea!

684
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:49,927
Welcome!

685
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,387
I killed Deok-su, okay?

686
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,432
Come on! Come at me, you bastards.

687
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,894
-Hey!
-Go! Kill Deok-su!

688
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,979
Get him!

689
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,319
Money?

690
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,487
Yeah.

691
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,531
How much?

692
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,202
About…

693
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,829
two million won.

694
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,957
Two million won?

695
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,544
Yeah.

696
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,052
You think you can come here
and ask for that?

697
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,390
You never paid child support
or any alimony or help us with anything.

698
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,725
And now you're asking us
to give you money?

699
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,648
I'm sorry. It's for… my mom.

700
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,983
She was in the hospital.

701
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,239
And how bad is it?

702
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,325
She has diabetes.

703
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,912
She needs surgery.

704
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,506
Well, I'm broke.

705
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,675
Things have been hard.

706
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,806
Please, I'm begging you.

707
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,560
Mom was always really good to you.

708
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,437
Look how desperate I was to ask you.

709
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,398
And I'll give it back.

710
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,984
I really am broke.

711
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,361
I just get money from my husband.

712
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,073
Well, then could you,
could you ask him for it?

713
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,241
You crazy?

714
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,494
Hey.

715
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,248
And what am I supposed to tell him
it's for if he asks, huh?

716
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,129
Out. Now.

717
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,298
-Hey.
-The kids' dad will be here soon.

718
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,674
-Go.
-Hey.

719
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,969
What the hell do you think
you're doing calling him her dad?

720
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,306
-I'm her real father, okay?
-Oh, yeah? Tell me more.

721
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,101
Go ahead. Why don't you tell me
what you did to deserve to be her dad?

722
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,937
You-- Were you there when she was born?
Didn't think so.

723
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,440
You know that…

724
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,901
I told you all that, okay.

725
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,402
And you know why I couldn't go.

726
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,612
Someone collapsed at work.

727
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,739
Yeah, well, I fainted too.

728
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,284
I was alone and had to crawl
just to get myself over to the hospital.

729
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,537
-And if I'd been any later, she'd be dead!
-No, I watched that guy die!

730
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,830
With my own eyes!

731
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,000
But no hospital, though. He couldn't go!

732
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,590
Honey, we're home.

733
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,844
You're home early.

734
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,430
Um, hi, Dad.

735
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,146
Hi, Mom!

736
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,235
Come on in here, guys.
He stopped by to see Ga-yeong.

737
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,444
Um…

738
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,531
And now that I saw her, I'll get going.

739
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,743
You're going?

740
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,537
Yeah, I have an important meeting
to go to.

741
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,622
Ga-yeong, bye now.

742
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,624
-I'll see you soon.
-Hmm.

743
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,336
-How do you open…
-Here.

744
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,712
Thanks.

745
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,429
Why did he come here this time?

746
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,516
-Why did you let him in the house?
-I'm sorry.

747
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:29,229
I was coming back from the market,
and he was waiting at the front door.

748
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,573
Wait.

749
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,791
What is that?

750
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,126
You needed money.

751
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,639
Thanks so much.

752
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,310
Uh, I swear I'll pay you back.

753
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,895
You don't have to.

754
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,482
Instead, you can stop trying
to contact our family.

755
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,695
It's tough for Ga-yeong, but…

756
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,156
we're moving to the US soon.

757
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,283
If you just keep showing up--

758
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,327
You asshole!

759
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,662
Do you think money solves everything?

760
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,627
Dad, why?

761
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,870
Seong Gi-hun?

762
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,998
Yeah?

763
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,169
Hwang Jun-ho, police.

764
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,006
You recently made a report
at the station, right?

765
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,387
You said a group abducted people
and make them play games.

766
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,596
And you also said…

767
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,015
some players were killed too.

768
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,060
Oh, all that? Yeah, I just made that up.

769
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,688
Yeah, a story I made up when I was drunk.

770
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,565
They sent a card to my brother

771
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,485
just like the one you had, sir.

772
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,364
He went missing a few days ago.

773
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,243
I just found it, I don't know.

774
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,912
I saw it on the street
and just put it in my pocket.

775
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,038
Mr. Seong.

776
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,708
You can help me.

777
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,003
I need to get him back.

778
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,175
Why would you think…

779
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,347
that I will be useful to you
or anybody else?
