1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,164
The intruder?

2
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>We haven't located him yet, sir.</i>

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,089
Make sure you catch him.

4
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,883
The VIPs will arrive soon.

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,236
EPISODE 7
VIPS

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,100
Deok-su, honey, so glad you won.

7
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,769
How…

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,395
how the hell…

9
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,897
What?

10
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,609
You're looking at me
like you've seen a ghost. Are you okay?

11
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,700
The masked guys all called me this,
"the weakest link."

12
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,581
Like when nobody chooses you as a partner
for things when you were a kid.

13
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,251
Hey, this guy knows about it.

14
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,585
The weakest link!

15
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,383
And after that, they gently
escorted me back to this dorm.

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,304
Because…

17
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,016
they said that it's all
a part of a rule that…

18
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,018
in the old days…

19
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,106
not to let a kid turn
into some kind of an outcast, I guess.

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,484
Goddamn it!

21
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,278
It's amazing, isn't it?

22
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,511
Front Man speaking.

23
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,183
I'm happy to hear you enjoy the game, sir.

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,813
Yes, sir. The host is currently waiting
for the VIPs to arrive.

25
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,345
Are you in here right now?

26
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,473
You're good, but you made one mistake.

27
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,976
I always put the receiver down
the other way.

28
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,407
The bullet you shot was from
a Smith and Wesson M60 revolver,

29
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,327
standard issue for Korean police.

30
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,956
What's a cop doing here

31
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,917
without a partner?

32
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,631
I am sure you have lots of questions.

33
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,759
It's not too late to come out and talk.

34
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,013
I don't know how you got in,

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,350
but you can't leave this place
without my permission.

36
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>We found a body.</i>

37
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,034
Where is it?

38
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>The northern coast of the island.</i>

39
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,886
Don't worry about it.

40
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,644
He was an old man
you only knew for a few days.

41
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,691
See that man there?

42
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,693
His partner was his wife.

43
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,933
We found this police ID on him.

44
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,730
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

45
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985
<i>The VIPs have arrived.</i>

46
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,576
Incinerate the body.

47
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,667
Let…

48
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,504
Let's just stop all this.
I can't keep doing this. I can't.

49
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,428
The majority must agree.
Well, come on, let's get out.

50
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,055
Half of us, that's all we need
to end this right now.

51
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,142
Don't any of you want to leave
this horrible place?

52
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,812
Anyone who wants to go, stand up.
Let's get out of here.

53
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,821
How can you call yourselves human?

54
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,826
How many of you can continue
with this insanity

55
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
just for the money?

56
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,041
You just had to kill the ones
you were the closest to at this place,

57
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,584
and you're good with that

58
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,461
just to get the money?

59
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,172
So what if we stop now?

60
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,719
You think your wife will stop being dead
if we all go now?

61
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,598
And she'll forgive you
for letting her get murdered?

62
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,935
If you can't keep going,
then why are you alive right now?

63
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,229
You should've been the one
who died in there instead.

64
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,440
See that?

65
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,401
That's the price of being in here.

66
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,279
And your wife and the others
paid it with their lives.

67
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,906
-No.
-And you wanna go and leave?

68
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,283
You wanna start from the beginning again?

69
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,079
You ready to do all that, huh?

70
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,373
Starting over again
from nothing with that guilt.

71
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,627
And is everybody here
ready to do that as well?

72
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,381
Go ahead, stand up!
Let's see who thinks they are.

73
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,134
Get up and get out of here!

74
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,516
No…

75
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,717
The VIPs have arrived outside.

76
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,831
Greetings.

77
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,376
I hope your long trip here
has not been too difficult.

78
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,253
I am the Front Man.

79
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,506
I oversee all of the operations here
at this facility.

80
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
It is a true honor to welcome you.

81
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,845
Where is the host?

82
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,475
Regrettably, some urgent business
has prevented him from attending.

83
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,851
Seriously?

84
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,480
I find it hard to believe
the host would miss a night like tonight.

85
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,107
He asked me
to apologize on his behalf.

86
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,942
Did some problem happen here?

87
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,943
Not at all.

88
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,113
It's just a personal matter of the host.

89
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,574
The remaining games
will be held as scheduled.

90
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,786
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

91
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,120
Well, I hope not.

92
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,792
Listen, I'm willing to give anybody
some slack. That's not a problem.

93
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,963
I just have to say
that I'm a difficult man to please.

94
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,591
I hope you won't disappoint me.

95
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,427
Shall we?

96
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,240
Oh, Lord, be my shepherd, be my guide.

97
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,741
May you watch over me tonight.

98
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,660
May you give me protection and strength

99
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,704
that I need to make my way
through these routes,

100
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,539
and may you light the path
to my salvation.

101
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,833
I give myself to you, Oh Lord.

102
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,544
Please look down on me
with pity and forgiveness.

103
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,338
I pray for those who have sacrificed
themselves for me,

104
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,923
or forgive them as well.

105
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,134
Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me

106
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,052
for what I have done and what I may do.

107
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,596
I live with my heart only by your graces.

108
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,683
I am your humble servant,
and I seek repentance for my sins.

109
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,561
Oh, God, protect me and save my soul.

110
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,979
I know I'm a sinner,

111
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,106
but I seek holy absolution in your light.

112
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,193
I am dying to know what this next game is.

113
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,695
Give us a hint, will you?

114
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,950
As much as I'd like to, sir,
I'd hate to ruin the fun for everyone.

115
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,786
The games of this edition
have been amazing.

116
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,123
Right.
The contest in Korea was the best.

117
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,542
Thank you.

118
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,962
I believe this next game
will exceed your expectations.

119
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,047
Well, that's why
we came all this way.

120
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,342
Trust me. The screens
we have at home are plenty big, but…

121
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,179
nothing beats seeing with your own eyes.

122
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,889
No!

123
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,058
No, don't do it, you idiot! You asshole!

124
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,560
Fucking loser!

125
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,270
What are you so worked up about?

126
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,939
I put a lot of money
on that dickhead to win.

127
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,065
Oh!

128
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,984
How much did you bet?

129
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,694
-A million bucks!
-Ooh.

130
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,531
What convinced you
to bet so much on number 69?

131
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh, it's, uh, such a beautiful number, 69.

132
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,164
Oh, you dirty dog.

133
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,874
Oh.

134
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,961
You can place your bets again
before the next game begins.

135
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,633
Why don’t you all get some rest
in your rooms?

136
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,969
We’ll come and get you
when everything’s ready.

137
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,513
I'm looking forward to it.

138
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,183
So, will you bet on brain or muscle?

139
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,935
So who you're putting
your money on this time?

140
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,228
I think
I'm going muscle all the way.

141
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,522
-I still haven't decided yet.
-Number 101.

142
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,106
-What about you?
-I'm torn between a couple of them.

143
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,608
Sixty-two, I think.

144
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,668
Your shift's over.

145
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,907
<i>Player 69, eliminated.</i>

146
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,677
<i>Attention, all players.</i>
<i>The fifth game is about to begin.</i>

147
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,263
<i>All players,</i>
<i>follow the staff's instructions</i>

148
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,724
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

149
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,341
So how are your scores
so far? Bet on any winners?

150
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,385
No.

151
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,138
For some reason, I keep picking losers.

152
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,432
Now is your chance to catch up.

153
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,602
The serious betting starts in this round.

154
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,146
And how much you gonna bet?

155
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,775
I’m doubling my stakes on this round.

156
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,111
Are you sure about that?

157
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,071
You don't even know
what game it’s gonna be.

158
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,450
It doesn't matter what game it is,
I trust my gut.

159
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,971
Goddamn it.

160
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,724
Just tell us about the next game.

161
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,351
How long are you gonna string us
along like this?

162
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,188
He's in a bad mood because of 69.
Better tell him quickly.

163
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,942
Gentlemen,
let me introduce the next game.

164
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,244
What's that thing?

165
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,165
Looks like a bridge of some sort.

166
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,125
I like the looks of it.

167
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,128
What the hell is that?

168
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,746
<i>Welcome, players, to the fifth game.</i>

169
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,083
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>please make your way down the steps</i>

170
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,169
<i>and choose one of the mannequins</i>
<i>that you see presented before you.</i>

171
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>Once you've chosen,</i>
<i>take the corresponding vest.</i>

172
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,007
<i>They are numbered 1 through 16.</i>

173
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,469
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

174
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,013
<i>Please make your way down the steps</i>

175
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,891
<i>and choose one of the mannequins</i>
<i>that you see before you,</i>

176
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,559
<i>and take the corresponding vest.</i>

177
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,853
<i>They are numbered 1 through 16.</i>

178
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,317
Ooh, this is exciting.

179
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,987
Gentlemen,
this may be the deciding moment.

180
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,280
There are plenty of other variables,

181
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,658
but I think the order,
in which they compete, matters most.

182
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,576
Who are you betting on this time?

183
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,497
Ninety-six.

184
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,040
What's your reason?

185
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,709
Well, if I can't do 69,

186
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,379
I'll try 96.

187
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,218
-Good luck with that.
-How do you know this guy?

188
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,178
I didn't bring him.
I thought you brought him.

189
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,430
Me? No.

190
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,308
Oh, jeez. You kill me.

191
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,811
Oh.

192
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,573
<i>There are 16 people left,</i>

193
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>and there are 16 numbers.</i>

194
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,594
It was on the sixth day
that God created the first man on Earth.

195
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,264
And now, I will go back
to that day God made us

196
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,641
sinless and innocent.

197
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,907
Okay. Lucky number seven, come on.

198
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,002
Mm.

199
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,218
They always take the middle numbers first.

200
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,886
Animal instinct.

201
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,766
When faced with danger,
seek refuge in the herd.

202
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,143
<i>What should I do?</i>

203
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,145
<i>The middle numbers are all taken.</i>

204
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,858
Only two choices left. Front or back?

205
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,320
I can't say I'd know
which one to choose either.

206
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,906
Shall I help them along
with their decision?

207
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,242
Sure, drop them a hint.

208
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,662
Show mercy to the miserable!

209
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,580
Okay, do it.

210
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,418
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

211
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>The numbers you see on the mannequins</i>

212
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,924
<i>correspond to the order</i>
<i>in which you will be playing.</i>

213
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>Please make your decision carefully.</i>

214
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,804
<i>The order?</i>

215
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>That we're playing in?</i>

216
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,600
<i>Okay.</i>

217
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,521
<i>If this is the order we'd play,</i>
<i>then the low numbers are better.</i>

218
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,943
<i>It's probably gonna have a time limit</i>
<i>like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.</i>

219
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,153
<i>It's better to get a head start.</i>

220
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,864
<i>Wait.</i>

221
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,991
<i>No.</i>

222
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,869
<i>It'd be too dangerous to go first</i>
<i>without knowing the game.</i>

223
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,914
<i>If I stay in the back,</i>
<i>I can watch the ones who go first</i>

224
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,749
<i>and make a plan like in Tug-of-War.</i>

225
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,802
<i>Sixteen.</i>

226
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>I can't go with 16.</i>

227
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,932
<i>Whatever it is,</i>
<i>it's too dangerous to go last.</i>

228
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,612
<i>Number 1? That means</i>
<i>I'll be starting the game off.</i>

229
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>Then should I go last?</i>

230
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>No, that seems wrong too.</i>

231
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,080
<i>Gi-hun, pull yourself together.</i>

232
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,583
Down to two positions,

233
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,668
first and last.

234
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,212
Mm. The start and the finish.

235
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,298
Two places you really don't wanna be.

236
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,301
Going first in a life-or-death contest?

237
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,178
Very scary.

238
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,264
But recall, too, that in the first game,

239
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:34,144
most of the contestants in the back died
after running out of time, so…

240
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,356
you can't feel too comfortable
picking 16 either.

241
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,484
You bet on 96, right?

242
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,194
Yeah.

243
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,988
Pick a good one.

244
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,908
What?

245
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,952
Where are you going?

246
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,413
Excuse me.

247
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,629
Could I be number one instead?

248
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,298
As long as I can remember,

249
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,592
I've been hiding behind people
when I got scared.

250
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,803
My life has been this thing

251
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,305
that I've never really been able
to truly control.

252
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,643
And I tried to act
like I wasn't afraid, but I was.

253
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,856
And now, as always,
I'm choosing my number last

254
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,817
after everybody else here.

255
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,363
I wanna get at least one last chance
to claim ownership of my life.

256
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,865
Sir, give this chance to me.

257
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,369
Please just give me that.

258
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,212
<i>Thank you!</i>

259
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,173
<i>-Thank you!</i>
-You fuckwad!

260
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,008
Piece of shit!

261
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,178
Oh, it's really not your day, is it?

262
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,306
First, 69, and now, 96.

263
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,186
Motherfucker!

264
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,773
Son of a bitch!

265
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,943
Now, the game will begin.

266
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,555
Oh, wow. It's bigger!

267
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,100
Yeah. A lot bigger.

268
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,202
<i>Hello, players,</i>
<i>let me welcome you all to the fifth game.</i>

269
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,623
<i>The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.</i>

270
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,294
<i>The stepping stones before you</i>
<i>are made from one of two types of glass,</i>

271
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,923
<i>one will be tempered glass</i>
<i>and the other will be normal glass.</i>

272
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,091
<i>The tempered glass stepping stone</i>

273
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,136
<i>as strong enough</i>
<i>to hold the weight of two people.</i>

274
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,682
<i>However, the normal glass will break</i>
<i>even if just one person steps on it.</i>

275
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,102
<i>For this game, you will guess</i>
<i>which one of next two tiles</i>

276
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
<i>is the tile made</i>
<i>of the stronger tempered glass,</i>

277
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:28,068
<i>and only step on those</i>
<i>across the 18 pairs of tile.</i>

278
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,154
<i>You may then cross over</i>
<i>to the other side safely</i>

279
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,906
<i>and pass this game.</i>

280
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,129
That means the numbers on us…

281
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,132
Are the order in which
you will cross the bridge.

282
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,075
But then, how do I tell
which is the tempered one?

283
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,890
Scumbag.

284
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,977
Ah.

285
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,229
Bring me another scotch.

286
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,234
Hey, you!

287
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,210
I don't wanna have
to keep calling you back.

288
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,922
Sit down here.

289
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,008
I must serve the other guests, sir.

290
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,470
I'm gonna keep this one next to me.

291
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,305
Any objections?

292
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,723
Not at all.

293
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,184
-As you please.
-He's all yours.

294
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,357
<i>For this game, you will have 16 minutes.</i>

295
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,735
<i>Players must cross the bridge</i>
<i>within those 16 minutes.</i>

296
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,988
<i>And now, with that, let the game begin.</i>

297
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,701
<i>Each player, take off your shoes,</i>
<i>then go up to the tiles in order.</i>

298
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,130
Hmm.

299
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,387
Hmm.

300
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,728
-What are you doing?
-We're losing time!

301
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,854
-Hurry up and go!
-Just jump!

302
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,690
-Are you just gonna stand there?
-Hey.

303
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,401
Take your step now or I'll push your ass.

304
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,862
I'll go. I'll go, okay? I'll go.
I'll go right now.

305
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,615
And please try to choose carefully, huh.

306
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,538
You did it.

307
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,582
You picked right.

308
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:34,212
Oh! Yes, that's it.
Keep doing that one after the other.

309
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,005
-Come on.
-You got this.

310
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,215
-That's it. Go on.
-Come on.

311
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,687
He's gone.

312
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,730
Oh, no.

313
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,940
Well, that's it for 96.

314
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,526
Aw, what a shame.

315
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,613
Oh. Hmm, you've already found
some more fun.

316
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,410
What pretty eyes you have.

317
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,683
Step one was left.

318
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,394
Step two is on the right.

319
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,545
You can do it.

320
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,839
-Hey, you got this.
-Hurry the hell up and go!

321
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,841
I'm looking at 15.

322
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,843
-Stop stalling!
-The tiles ahead of me.

323
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,886
Let's go.

324
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,179
-So the probability that…
-We don't have time for this.

325
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,973
-I'll get everything right is…
-Hey, you got this.

326
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,850
…two to the power of fifteen.

327
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,187
Times that…

328
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,403
One in 32,768.

329
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,495
Damn it.

330
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,963
Excuse me, ma'am.

331
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,548
Do you think

332
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,969
that you could help me?
You happen to remember what he chose next?

333
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,555
I can't seem to recall which one now.

334
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,808
Oh, I don't know,
uh, it happened too quickly.

335
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,226
Think hard please.

336
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,605
Since both of our lives
depend on getting this next one.

337
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,315
Okay.

338
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,321
-The left one I think.
-Wait, no.

339
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,489
-He went right and then he went left.
-Uh, he didn't do that.

340
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,492
-He went left right away.
-No, it was right from there.

341
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,920
You, are you sure…

342
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,924
he went left first?

343
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,134
Mm-hm.

344
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,115
So he went right.

345
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,786
Number five fucked up.

346
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,537
Another fall from grace.

347
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,581
Take that mask off.

348
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,962
Take your mask off!

349
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,924
I want to see your face.

350
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,010
Yeah!

351
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,066
There are ten tiles left,

352
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,110
and 11 people still playing.

353
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,113
If they manage to step on one or two each,

354
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,824
the three of us can get across to the end.

355
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,201
That might not be the case.

356
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,246
If one of those players get scared
and starts to run down the time,

357
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,124
we are in danger at the back of the line.

358
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,365
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name--

359
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,242
Get up. What are you doing?

360
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,244
-You're praying right now?
-As it is in Heaven.

361
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,079
-Seriously?
-What's he doing up there?

362
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,831
Come on! Just go!

363
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,625
Hey, just get up and stop praying, okay?

364
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,669
You idiot, it's your turn!

365
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,714
You gotta go!
Everybody will die, you know!

366
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:17,430
No number can determine
when the Lord calls for somebody.

367
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,935
Judgment is called down to us here.

368
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,897
It's our time to face the Lord.

369
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,901
Anyway, we're all going to Hell.

370
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,986
Hurry, so I can move to the next one.

371
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,198
If you don't, then I might have
to push you into him, okay?

372
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,913
You want a wind-up dead, buddy?
Get that asshole to stop praying.

373
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,211
Get going, you idiot.

374
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,090
Step forward. Come on, damn it!
You'll kill us all!

375
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,451
Thank you. God bless me today.

376
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,005
Don't push me.

377
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,340
Okay?

378
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,343
Hey, come on. I got no reason to push you.

379
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,055
You gotta cross so I can. Huh?

380
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,476
It's the left.

381
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,145
It's the left one.

382
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,855
Get it together.

383
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,193
Okay.

384
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,203
Thanks so much.

385
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,010
You're doing good.
Now you just keep going.

386
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,228
I know which one of these
is the strong glass.

387
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,437
You mean it?

388
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,023
You can see the tempered glass?

389
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,358
I'm pretty sure.

390
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,818
It's in the color.

391
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,251
You don't know anything. Goddamn idiot.

392
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,279
Hey, everybody, listen!

393
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,365
Anyone wanna get across?

394
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,325
Well, you better go first then.

395
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,912
Ah, shit.

396
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,709
Oh, it's getting exciting.

397
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,879
We can't show our faces in here.

398
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
You're all mine.

399
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,803
But after you leave, they'll kill me.

400
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,850
If you don't do what I say,

401
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,603
I will kill you before I leave.

402
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,277
Please.

403
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,487
Take me somewhere

404
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,489
where we can be alone.

405
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,461
You're leaving
at the most exciting moment?

406
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,338
Hey, you all have fun.

407
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,717
I'm going off for a different kind of fun.

408
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,262
Mmm, the real 69, huh?

409
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,015
Bon appétit!

410
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,434
Have a good fucking time.

411
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,527
-What are you doing?
-You deaf or what, asshole?

412
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,613
I'm not going until you do.

413
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,864
Are you crazy, man?

414
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,992
But the rule is we go in order.

415
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,498
You can just kiss my ass.

416
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,210
We're in Hell here.
There's no rules in Hell.

417
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,128
You wanna go so bad? Go ahead.

418
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,214
You scumbag!

419
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,134
If you don't move up, I'll push you then.

420
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,636
Okay.

421
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,847
Well then, come on. Then do it!

422
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,474
We'll all die here together!

423
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,309
Hey, listen, everybody!

424
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,562
I'm not dying here for anyone.
So come on, let's do this!

425
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,191
Get up here and go ahead.

426
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,944
If you don't, we all die.

427
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,780
Your choice, dickhead.

428
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,282
Stop that bullshit, you asshole.

429
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,828
The clock is ticking. You gotta go soon.

430
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,080
You'll be waiting here
till we're all dead.

431
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,671
Oh, shit.

432
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,025
That's not the kind of face

433
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,613
you should keep behind a mask.

434
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,957
Oh.

435
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,296
If you…

436
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,299
can satisfy me

437
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,886
in five minutes,

438
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,182
I'll change your life.

439
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,863
Satisfied?

440
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,669
If you can satisfy me in five minutes,

441
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,005
I might let you live.

442
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,430
Tell me everything
you know about the game.

443
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,774
Damn it, you better go!

444
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,025
Please just go on!

445
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,735
Just go!

446
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,553
My God, you're all such idiots.

447
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,393
Man, you used to act
like such a tough guy.

448
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,103
Babe, what happened to you?

449
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,146
Are you really pulling the shit?

450
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,068
-Oh, man, you're pathetic.
-You're just an ugly old bitch, okay.

451
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,196
Look, I'm not moving forward. Not at all.

452
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,656
Deok-su.

453
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,243
All of these people dead
but the worst thing is…

454
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,871
I let you fuck me
in the bathroom that day.

455
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,165
Why don't you go first to die?

456
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,003
Fine. Sure.

457
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,381
You mean…

458
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,049
-Meaning you'll go?
-Yeah.

459
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,011
It's Han Mi-nyeo here.

460
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,182
You don't think that I'd be able
to do something quite as cowardly as…

461
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,892
waiting here till I die.

462
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,566
Come on then. Go ahead.

463
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,328
Good luck.

464
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,878
What are you doing?

465
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,838
You're such an idiot.

466
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,841
Did you believe I'd really die
so you could go on?

467
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,136
Let me go.

468
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,262
Remember?

469
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,139
We said we'd stick together
right to the end.

470
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,351
Crazy bitch, let me go! Damn it!

471
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,436
Get your fucking hands off me right now!

472
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,732
Goddamn it!

473
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,738
You betrayed me. Now you're going to die.

474
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,660
No, please.

475
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,663
I'll go first, okay? Huh?

476
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,457
Let me go, please. Please!

477
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,917
You coward.

478
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,628
Deok-su.

479
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,755
I need you to know…

480
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,716
you've got such a tiny dick.

481
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,554
You goddamn bitch!

482
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,451
Oh.

483
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,413
Now there's a poetic ending for those two.

484
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,456
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."

485
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,752
Another student of the Bard.
I had no idea.

486
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,839
Actually, it's not Shakespeare.
It's Congreve. William Congreve.

487
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,216
I like you better when you don't talk.

488
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,226
Go check the VIP room.

489
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,522
Oh!

490
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,786
Move. Quick!

491
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,830
You can't just stop.

492
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,250
Hold on. Wait, one second.
I can tell the panels apart.

493
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,587
-You can tell?
-I used to make glass for over 30 years.

494
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,089
You can't normally tell, but…

495
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:04,094
when you look at tempered glass
when it's lit from the side,

496
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,556
then you can see faint stain marks.

497
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,783
Another hint, the sound.

498
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:30,329
Tempered glass is made
at a heat over 700 degrees.

499
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:34,041
Pound on it with a hammer
and it rings clearer than normal glass.

500
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,251
Why wasn't all this brought up earlier?

501
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,712
-If you had led everybody from--
-Why would I?

502
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,965
The players up here
tried to kill us at every chance.

503
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,718
Hmm.

504
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,943
Can he really tell the difference?

505
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,444
I think so.

506
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,488
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE
IN GLASS MANUFACTURING

507
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:10,035
According to his file,
he once had a job as a glass manufacturer.

508
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,331
That was in the report?
Hah! How did I miss that?

509
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,499
I didn't catch it either.

510
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,293
Well, that's no fun.

511
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,382
Yup, number 13 definitely sees
something that the others can't.

512
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,802
I think he might be examining
the refraction of the light.

513
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,221
Let me adjust the settings.

514
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,081
It seems to have done the trick.

515
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,418
Yeah, he's not so confident now.

516
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,516
What's wrong?

517
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,978
What's the problem?

518
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,731
I can't tell them apart in the dark.

519
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,070
Excuse me, sir.

520
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,041
<i>The VIP has collapsed.</i>

521
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,792
Is he alive?

522
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,252
<i>He's fine.</i>

523
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,587
And the intruder?

524
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,048
<i>We're searching for him now.</i>

525
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,810
All right, which one?
You need to choose now.

526
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,188
I need to listen to the sound.

527
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,691
You got anything to throw?

528
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,112
Do… do you have anything?

529
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,265
I need another.

530
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,352
I need to hear the right one,
so I can be sure.

531
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,850
I can't tell what it is.

532
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,310
I'll pick, okay?

533
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,600
One of the dive packs is gone.

534
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,478
<i>I suspect the intruder took it.</i>

535
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,064
Start tracking it
and get the boat ready.

536
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,483
Oh! That's hard to top.

537
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,818
-Bravo!
-Bravo.

538
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,778
-Bravo!
-Yes.
