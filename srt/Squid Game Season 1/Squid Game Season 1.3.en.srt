1
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,966
CHIEF, I CAN'T GO TO THE STATION TODAY.
I'LL CONTACT YOU LATER.

2
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,482
EPISODE 3
THE MAN WITH THE UMBRELLA

3
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,424
Ready.

4
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,801
Begin player inspection.

5
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,686
NAME: SEONG GI-HUN

6
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,313
NAME: CHAE GANG-SUN

7
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,099
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

8
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,693
Hey, you!

9
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,536
Sorry.

10
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,580
I just got seasick.

11
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,376
Did you forget the rules?

12
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,629
You do not speak
unless your superior allows you to.

13
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,217
Go standby in the cabin.

14
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,358
Hey, sir.

15
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,697
Wake up, sir.

16
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,743
Wake up. Get up, huh?

17
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,037
Uh-huh.

18
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,914
Are you all right?

19
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,082
You're here.

20
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,046
So Player 456 came back.

21
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,339
Yeah.

22
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,467
I got scared.
I thought you were gone for good.

23
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,014
Hey. I won't die so easily, you know.

24
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,849
I know you won't.

25
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,768
I stopped playing because of you,
and I'm back because of what you said.

26
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,437
I'm actually sort of partial to you.

27
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,990
A lot of people
decided to come back.

28
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,619
You're right. Hmm.

29
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,038
-Yeah.
-I guess everybody's desperate.

30
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,998
-Oh.
-Huh?

31
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,919
There, look. That's the woman who couldn't
name her kid. She came back too.

32
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,003
You're right.

33
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,215
Think she named her kid yet?

34
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,716
I don't know.

35
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,717
Gi-hun.

36
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,052
Oh, Sang-woo.

37
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,265
So you're here.
I didn't think I'd see you.

38
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,062
Neither did I.

39
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,439
And you?

40
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,234
Your mom, did you see her?

41
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,570
Hey, good sirs.

42
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,489
Oh. Hey.

43
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,199
It's my angel.

44
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,201
I'm happy to see both of you.
I hope we make it.

45
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,913
Thanks for the bus fare, sir.
It meant so much to me.

46
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,581
What, you gave him the bus fare?

47
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,833
Because he said that
he'd walk Yeouido to Ansan.

48
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,503
That's so heartwarming.

49
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,339
We're like a bunch of soldiers
at training camp, huh?

50
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,383
A training camp is what?

51
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,387
You know, it's like the army
shooting guns.

52
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,098
Oh! Soldiers all training together?

53
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,057
Uh-huh.

54
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,892
Wait a minute.

55
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,896
Since we're on the subject now,
you should join me.

56
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,982
We should just form our own team,
don't you think?

57
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,235
You're right. Who knows what game
they'll have us play next.

58
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,572
It wouldn't hurt to be in a group
so we're ready for anything.

59
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,616
Hey, you should join up with us.

60
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,160
I mean, we already know he's crazy strong.

61
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,162
You saw it.

62
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,082
He lifted me up with one hand
like it was nothing at all.

63
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,503
You mean… that you… I can join you?

64
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,299
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, so then,
you'll be the new recruit.

65
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,676
He's the skilled corporal,
and that means I'm a sergeant.

66
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,596
Oh, man. Thank you, sir.

67
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,056
-Please just drop the "sir," will you?
-Excuse me.

68
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,895
If you don't mind,
can I join up with all of you?

69
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,105
Yeah, of course.

70
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,774
And you can be the… Hold on…

71
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,111
So you can be the old major
who's been in the army his entire life.

72
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,946
Thanks so much.

73
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,701
Yeah. Quite a team we got going here.
Damn! Let's do this.

74
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,289
I'll take you in again
and look past everything.

75
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,249
Come and join us.

76
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,128
We were a good team
for a while out there, huh?

77
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,963
Are you actually serious?

78
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,634
I mean, everybody out there
is still looking for you.

79
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,177
Stop with the act.

80
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,638
It doesn't matter how tough you are,

81
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,474
you're not going to win in this place.
Not on your own.

82
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,769
Didn't you notice?

83
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,729
Those jerks with masks came in

84
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,522
and removed the beds
of the people who died.

85
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,442
Make one mistake out there,
and yours is next.

86
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,945
Worry about your own ass, okay?

87
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,866
Don't join him.

88
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,077
This guy's a dumb dumbass.

89
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,373
He liked to pick
all of his little minions' pockets

90
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,500
just so he could fill up his own.

91
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,128
He got bold enough one day
to go after his head honcho's pockets,

92
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,213
but now he's in here.

93
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,298
'Cause he was stupid and got caught.

94
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,885
You know what people in my hometown
would call you, huh?

95
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,890
A damn revolutionary asshole.

96
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,227
You communist little bitch, I'm gonna…

97
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,813
Excuse me.

98
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,815
Am I interrupting you?

99
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,525
Sorry.

100
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,818
What is it?

101
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,777
Oh, boy.

102
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,904
You're really good looking.

103
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,493
Come on, let me join you guys.

104
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,452
Join what?

105
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,746
I'll be your teammate.

106
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,126
Tell me what you're good at?

107
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,294
Everything, except the things I can't do.

108
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,340
And I'm certainly better
than some skinny girl.

109
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,843
A lot better.

110
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,469
You mean, you're that good?

111
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,015
How about it?

112
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,059
Plenty of empty beds.

113
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Your mealtime begins now.</i>

114
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,985
<i>-All players, please form a line…</i>
-Maybe later.

115
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>…in the center of the room.</i>

116
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,655
<i>Let me repeat the instruction.</i>

117
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,742
<i>Attention. Your mealtime begins now.</i>

118
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,953
<i>All players, please form a line</i>
<i>in the center of the room.</i>

119
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,210
Assholes.

120
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,272
Out of 201, 187 returned.

121
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,900
The re-entrance rate is 93 percent.

122
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,363
Keep an eye on the ones
who didn't return to play

123
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,157
and keep me posted.

124
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,366
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,345
-Mm…
-Ahh…

126
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,139
This brings back old memories.

127
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,433
Do you remember eating lunches
like this too?

128
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,392
Of course.

129
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,605
My wife was always in the kitchen
every morning.

130
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:39,318
She'd pack lunches just like these ones
for me and my kids.

131
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,571
I wish the rice was piping hot.

132
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,158
At least they could've
warmed it up a little.

133
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,285
All we need is a stove.

134
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,620
Remember doing that?

135
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,375
The little briquette stove we had
in our elementary school classroom.

136
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,835
We'd stick our lunch boxes on it.

137
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,128
It'd get burning hot on us too,

138
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,880
and the rice'd get all scorched. Hmm?

139
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,842
Gi-hun.

140
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,968
Hmm?

141
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,970
Let's try to stay on the subject.

142
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,180
How about putting your mind
to what the game could be?

143
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,808
Mm.

144
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,809
Hey.

145
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,144
No one can figure that out.

146
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,188
We'll find out when it's time.

147
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,693
You know, considering the last one
that we did,

148
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:26,031
I think that there'll be another old game
kids played, just like I used to.

149
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,658
I'll bet you right there.

150
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,202
Think of all the ones they could choose.

151
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>Ddakji,Dabanggu</i>,

152
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,998
there's Hopscotch, <i>Biseokchigi,</i>

153
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,292
and Tag, <i>Don Katsu,</i> Freeze Tag.

154
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,046
And for girls, there's <i>Gonggi</i>, Elastics,
Cat's Cradle and…

155
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,841
And what else?

156
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,552
I don't know how to play those.

157
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,638
You don't know any of the games I listed?

158
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,474
Hey, listen to me.

159
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,685
All those games are easy to learn.

160
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,478
And we'll teach them to you.

161
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,857
That's much appreciated.

162
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,409
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>The work schedule is done for today.</i>

163
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,788
<i>All active staff, please take this time</i>

164
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,083

<i>All active staff, please take this time</i>
<i>to return to your rooms.</i>

167
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,629
1. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR MASK
OUTSIDE THE ROOM

168
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,838
2. DO NOT CONVERSE
WITHOUT PERMISSION

169
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,173
3. DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM
WITHOUT PERMISSION

170
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,889
Hey, hey, hey!
Open the door, you jerks!

171
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,934
I have to pee really bad, right now!

172
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,894
Don't you jerks ever take a leak?

173
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,397
Let me use the restroom! I gotta go now!

174
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,567
Hey, just let me use the bathroom
for one second. Jeez, come on!

175
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,988
Look, it's mostly men in here, okay?
Want a puddle here?

176
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,200
Damn it! Damn you, scumbags!

177
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,535
I hope you're ashamed.

178
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,787
Treat us like humans, damn it!
Who do you think you are?

179
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,581
Hey, Triangle.

180
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,042
I don't need you. Get me your superior.

181
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,254
Just get me that some square head guy!

182
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,176
You may not leave
this room past your given curfew.

183
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,556
Damn it. You masked guys think
you control when I'm supposed to pee, huh?

184
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,976
Oh, what the…

185
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,562
You freaking bastards!

186
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,440
You don't think
I'll go pee right here and now?

187
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,566
Shit!

188
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
Here I go.

189
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,363
You all ready to hear some rain?

190
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,745
Follow me.

191
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,957
Damn, Koreans won't listen to someone
until they start screaming at you.

192
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,333
Goddamn it.

193
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,295
I gotta go.

194
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,882
Oh, yeah?

195
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,092
I beg to get the damn toilet,

196
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,178
and you're gonna sit
right on top of it like that?

197
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,013
Hey.

198
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
You're a pretty annoying girl, aren't you?

199
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,480
What a rude little brat.

200
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,522
Hey.

201
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
That's so damn good--

202
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,956
Don't scare me like that.

203
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,416
What?

204
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,506
Wanna smoke a little?

205
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,800
You can stay put on the bowl
and smoke some more.

206
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,388
What are you doing?

207
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,606
Wait.

208
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,524
Are you going to go in there?

209
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,276
I wanna see what's up there.

210
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,572
Buy me some time.
Then I'll tell you if I find anything.

211
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,993
Deal. Step up here.

212
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,626
Oh, my God!

213
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,878
I bet the hell I've been here today.

214
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,801
It hurts a lot!
It's like trying to push out a kid!

215
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,095
Ah! I'm dying!

216
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,769
I'm dying.

217
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,688
Why won't it come out?

218
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,080
It's time to go back.

219
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,083
Just give me a second, okay?

220
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,544
Come on, you. Oh, it's all blocked.

221
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,754
You bastard, get out!

222
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,757
Hurry the hell up! We're in a rush, okay?

223
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,301
You need to go back.

224
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,802
Come out now.

225
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,055
Wait! Stop! No! Wait!

226
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,058
They're gone.
All of the stool wipes are gone!

227
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,518
Ah, shit.

228
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,813
Yeah, but I'll use the sink.

229
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,399
No, don't come in.

230
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,651
You just stay out there.

231
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,486
Did you hear that?

232
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,406
Don't come in here.
I'm not wearing pants, okay?

233
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,533
Okay.

234
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,494
The water is still nice in here.

235
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,511
What?

236
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,180
Keep stirring.

237
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,939
You have to come out.

238
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,275
Damn it!
There's no toilet paper here either!

239
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,487
-If you don't, I'll drag you out.
-I have to wipe myself, okay!

240
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,615
Hey, aren't you supposed to check
each stall for toilet paper?

241
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,200
Get that square guy here!

242
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,910
I need to file a complaint.

243
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,538
You bastard, what the hell?

244
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,208
I can't believe this.

245
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,796
You little bastard! You…

246
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,589
Hey, jerkface.

247
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,008
You, I said don't come in, didn't I?

248
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,219
You harassed us in there, yeah?

249
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,473
Hey, the second I'm out of here,
I'll sue your ass, okay?

250
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,101
Is that clear? Asshole!

251
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>It's now time for you to go to sleep.</i>

252
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,115
<i>Congratulations on a good day's work.</i>

253
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:52,472
<i>The island, abductions,</i>
<i>surveillance, and the masks…</i>

254
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,413
Hey, what did you see? Huh?

255
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,874
Come on. What did you see?

256
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,251
I'll tell you tomorrow.

257
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,504
Why tomorrow? Just tell me now.

258
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,631
Hey. What did you see?

259
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,803
You must have seen something.
You were up there for so long. Come on.

260
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,396
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>
<i>A new day has dawned.</i>

261
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,065
<i>Please wake up and prepare</i>
<i>for your duties.</i>

262
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,527
<i>In ten minutes,</i>
<i>the staff head count will begin.</i>

263
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,327
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>It is now time for breakfast.</i>

264
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,538
<i>All players, please form a line</i>
<i>in the center of the room.</i>

265
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,498
Hey.

266
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,460
What did you see? Tell me now.

267
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,172
It's the morning now, you said you would.

268
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,840
You were in there for a while, so go on.

269
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,510
Masked guys with pots, and they
were melting a liquid down there.

270
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,094
What was it?

271
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,805
I couldn't tell what.

272
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,057
Goddamn it!

273
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,435
I had to put on that whole show
just to save your life back there,

274
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,853
and you couldn't tell?

275
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,274
I smelled it, though.

276
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,484
What did it smell like?

277
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,694
Sugar or something.

278
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,904
You kidding me?

279
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,698
Are you saying
they were melting sugar in there?

280
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,950
I think they were.

281
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,660
So, it was just that?

282
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,375
Girl.

283
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,004
Look, if you aren't telling me everything.
I'll burn your eyes out with cigarettes.

284
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,553
I guess I'm hungry.

285
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,221
I'm craving something sweet.

286
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,306
Goddamn it.

287
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,434
Maybe they'll give us
candied sweet potatoes today.

288
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,545
<i>Beginning headcount now.</i>
<i>Please wait in front of your door.</i>

289
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>Head count complete.</i>

290
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,137
<i>All staff, proceed.</i>

291
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,701
Hey, is there…

292
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,705
any chocolate milk?
I can't drink the normal kind.

293
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,083
Oh, when I was a kid,
I had problems digesting it,

294
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,669
so I just skipped milk
when I was in school.

295
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,512
Ah, shit.

296
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,805
My goodness.

297
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,434
As a kid, I'm willing to bet
you got spanked a lot.

298
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,353
How did you know?

299
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,272
My son did too.
He was just like you, friend.

300
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,368
Hey, sir.

301
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,120
Why aren't you eating that?

302
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,708
Have it.

303
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,378
Do you mean it?

304
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,463
I don't eat most mornings.

305
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,758
Thanks so much, sir.

306
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,469
You know, geniuses never eat much.

307
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,519
Take mine too.

308
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,189
Thank you, sir.

309
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,575
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>The second game will begin shortly.</i>

310
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

311
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

312
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,541
<i>I will now repeat the instructions.</i>

313
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,837
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>The second game will begin shortly.</i>

314
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,256
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

315
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,842
<i>and swiftly make your way</i>
<i>towards the game hall.</i>

316
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,982
You saw something, right?

317
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,570
I happen to overhear
your discussion last night.

318
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,238
So tell me, what did you see?

319
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,074
Why would I?

320
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,202
You're a defector, right?

321
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,872
All the games they made us play in here
are games I have known

322
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,165
since I was a young boy.

323
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,585
The next game will be too,
I'm willing to bet.

324
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,961
You tell me what you saw,

325
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,380
I might guess what it is.

326
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,063
Why the hell is this playground so huge?

327
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,816
What's the game here?

328
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,818
<i>Players,</i>
<i>welcome to the second game.</i>

329
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,152
<i>We will begin shortly.</i>

330
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,406
Hey, what do we think? Huh?

331
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,949
Maybe that roundabout there.

332
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,785
Jungle gym without falling?

333
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,995
Huh?

334
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,789
<i>Players,</i>
<i>before the second game begins,</i>

335
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,084
<i>choose one of the four available shapes</i>
<i>you see on the wall.</i>

336
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,379
<i>Once you've chosen your shape,</i>
<i>please stand in front of it.</i>

337
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,881
Does she mean those?

338
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,884
So our options are circle, triangle,

339
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,303
star, umbrella.

340
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,682
I don't know. They seem very familiar.

341
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,853
<i>You tell me what you saw,</i>
<i>I might guess what it is.</i>

342
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,564
They were heating sugar.

343
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,879
Sang-woo.

344
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,963
Huh?

345
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,006
Got anything?

346
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,967
Not yet.

347
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,765
<i>Choose a shape</i>
<i>and stand in front of it immediately.</i>

348
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,978
<i>Choose a shape</i>
<i>and stand in front of it immediately.</i>

349
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,565
What do you think it could be?

350
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,074
Should we play this together?

351
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,161
That could be dangerous.

352
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,956
At this point, we don't know anything.

353
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,500
I think it would put us at a disadvantage
if we just choose one.

354
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,709
You think?

355
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,378
There's this saying in investing.

356
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,546
"Try not to keep your eggs
in the same basket."

357
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,675
Listen to him.

358
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,552
He was first in his class
in SNU Business School.

359
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,263
And in my hometown,
he was a genius. A prodigy.

360
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,641
Really? Is that so?

361
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,810
Well then, he is an incredible guy, huh?

362
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,353
Are you kidding me?

363
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,525
Like Sang-woo told us, let's all split up
and take it from there, huh?

364
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,652
Who should go where?

365
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,492
All right, let me go triangle.

366
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,119
What about you?

367
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,871
<i>Dayira.</i>

368
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,041
-Huh?
<i>-Dayira.</i>

369
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,793
-A circle, you mean?
-Yeah.

370
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,170
It looks just like the moon
where I'm from.

371
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,633
That means we have star and umbrella.

372
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,763
You pick first. Go on.

373
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,640
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

374
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,106
-Uh, then I'm choosing the umbrella.
-Hmm?

375
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,524
You sure?

376
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,026
Why?

377
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,488
Oh, growing up, I'd always lose
my umbrella so my mom would get angry.

378
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,866
So then, she gave me broken ones
to bring to school.

379
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,077
I always wanted her to get me
one of those good umbrellas

380
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,163
-like the other kids.
-Mm-hm.

381
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,916
Um, don't want the star?
Or do you wanna switch with me?

382
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,503
Oh, no, the star sounds great.

383
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,213
Good with me.

384
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,468
Besides, nobody really sees
many stars these days.

385
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,636
Great, let's get moving.

386
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,140
Once we know what we're up against,
let's set up a strategy together.

387
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,058
Sure.

388
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,268
-All right.
-Hmm.

389
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,104
Gi-hun, wait.

390
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,898
Huh?

391
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,695
Nothing.

392
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
<i>The time to select your shape has ended.</i>

393
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,848
<i>I will now explain the rules</i>
<i>of the next game.</i>

394
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:12,819
<i>All players, please take one case each</i>
<i>from the table at the front of your line.</i>

395
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:18,866
<i>All players, please take one case each</i>
<i>from the table at the front of your line.</i>

396
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,227
<i>Please take a moment to open the case</i>
<i>and check the contents.</i>

397
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,272
HONEYCOMB

398
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,038
What does this mean?

399
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,755
<i>The second game is sugar honeycombs.</i>

400
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,340
<i>The shape you have chosen</i>

401
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,135
<i>is the shape you must remove</i>
<i>from the honeycomb.</i>

402
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,598
<i>I'm dead.</i>

403
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,478
<i>The time limit is ten minutes.</i>

404
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,150
<i>You will pass if you trim out the shape</i>
<i>without it breaking or cracking</i>

405
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,193
<i>within the time limit.</i>

406
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,862
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

407
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,238
Wait…

408
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
One more chance.

409
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,117
Please. No, please don't…

410
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,766
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

411
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,059
Don't do it, sir.

412
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,393
Please don't…

413
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,529
<i>Player 111, pass.</i>

414
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,660
<i>Player 67, pass.</i>

415
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
The <i>Dayira.</i> I did it. I'm done.

416
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,263
Look, I'm done.

417
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,350
<i>Player 199, pass.</i>

418
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,355
<i>Player 210, pass.</i>

419
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,112
<i>Player 224, pass.</i>

420
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,116
<i>Player 246, pass.</i>

421
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,081
<i>Player 73, pass.</i>

422
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,628
Number 29.

423
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,963
-<i>Player 72, pass.</i>
-Sir?

424
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,256
What's your duty today?

425
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,800
-<i>Player 34, pass.</i>
-My duty is--

426
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,053
29, your duty
is carrying out eliminated players.

427
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,179
Why are you here now?

428
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,765
-I'm sorry.
-<i>Player 44, pass.</i>

429
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,099
I got confused.

430
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,268
Wait here till after the game ends.

431
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,563
I'll have a word with you
about that confusion.

432
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,484
<i>Player 32, pass.</i>

433
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,619
To the left.

434
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,336
<i>Player 122, pass.</i>

435
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,797
<i>Player 29, pass.</i>

436
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,346
<i>Player 218, pass.</i>

437
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,029
<i>Player 357, pass.</i>

438
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,616
<i>Player 83, pass.</i>

439
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,715
<i>Right.</i>
<i>I can melt it from the back.</i>

440
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,635
<i>The outline is thinner,</i>
<i>so it will melt first.</i>

441
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,747
<i>Player 212, pass.</i>

442
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,128
<i>Player 196, pass.</i>

443
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,632
<i>Player 244, pass.</i>

444
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,096
<i>Player 69, pass.</i>

445
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,931
<i>Player 70, pass.</i>

446
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,010
<i>Player 456, pass.</i>

447
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,522
<i>Your time to remove your shape is now up.</i>

448
00:46:56,605 --> 00:47:00,317
<i>All successful players,</i>
<i>please leave the playground immediately.</i>

449
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,610
Move your hands.

450
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,719
You see this, assholes, huh?

451
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,431
Goddamn it!
What kind of sick game was that?

452
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,769
Why do some people got easy shapes
while we all get shitty umbrellas, huh?

453
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,272
<i>Hey, you assholes, step back in there.</i>

454
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,608
<i>Stay there. I'll shoot.</i>

455
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,861
I'll shoot! Shoot him right here!

456
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,320
Goddamn it!

457
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,434
Take off your mask.

458
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,145
Don't make me shoot.

459
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,081
Turn around, okay.

460
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,798
You're just a kid.

461
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,009
What did they do to you?

462
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,365
Remember.

463
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,785
Once they find out who you are, you die.

464
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,681
<i>Number 29,</i>
<i>standby and await further instructions.</i>

465
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,141
<i>I'll have a word with you</i>
<i>about that confusion.</i>
