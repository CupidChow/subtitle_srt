00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,885
EPISODE 9
ONE LUCKY DAY

2
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,430
Player 218 and Player 456,

3
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,099
welcome to the final game.

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,897
Before we begin, we'll flip a coin
to decide who plays offense or defense.

5
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,317
Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,944
Triangle.

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,288
It's triangle.

8
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,333
Please choose either offense or defense.

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,048
Offense.

10
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,675
Player 456 will play offense.

11
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,761
Player 218 will defend.

12
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,152
For the final game,
you'll both be playing Squid Game.

13
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,906
Squid Game.

14
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,867
What an odd name.

15
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,496
It was originally
a children's game

16
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,542
-that was played in Korea many years ago.
-Hmm.

17
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,670
Let me explain
the rules of Squid Game.

18
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,965
One, the attacker must enter
the squid shape court,

19
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,635
run past the defense, and then tap
the area inside the squid's head

20
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,303
with his foot to secure the win.

21
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,807
Two, the defender must block
the attacker's advance

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,852
and force them outside
of the court's bounds in order to win.

23
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,229
Three, if a situation arises,

24
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,816
in which either player is unable
to continue playing the game,

25
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,026
the last one standing will be the winner.

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,286
A player's unable to continue.

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,622
Could you explain that?

28
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,334
That would be
referring to the player's death.

29
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,464
And now, with that, let the game begin.

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>Among all the games</i>
<i>that kids played back then,</i>

31
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,017
<i>it was the most physical and violent.</i>

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,852
So any kind of violence is allowed?

33
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,896
Sure. There are no restrictions.

34
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,428
Why is he hopping on one foot?

35
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,973
The attacker
is given a handicap.

36
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,561
He can only hop on one foot
until he crosses the squid's neck.

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,105
Oh, so the defender tries to block him.

38
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,273
Yes.

39
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,651
That's the first challenge of this game.

40
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
We always used to play this as kids.

41
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,534
When we cross…

42
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,704
do you remember what we used to call it?

43
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,872
Shut up. Who cares about all that?

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
Inspector royal.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,433
"Inspector royal," we called it.

46
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,919
Mm. It sounds so romantic.

47
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,629
What's it mean?

48
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:01,217
"Good rain
knows the best time to fall."

49
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,468
Du Fu.

50
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,519
I put an end to her suffering.

51
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,230
You know she would have died anyway.

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,733
That's bullshit. Stop lying.

53
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,110
She could've survived.

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,446
They would've treated her.

55
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
I know what you're like, okay?

56
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,451
You're the reason that I had to kill her.

57
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,955
I knew you two would stop all this,
so she didn't die in there.

58
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,750
Was that it?

59
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,420
You killed someone because this might end?

60
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,421
Yeah!

61
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,091
You and that girl would have been
the majority you needed to get out!

62
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,552
Going home without a single cent.
I couldn't do that!

63
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,639
She's the one who stopped me.

64
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,977
'Cause I was gonna kill you with this.

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,984
It's over.

66
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,530
I won't let you leave here
with that money.

67
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,042
You bastard!

68
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,790
Die!

69
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,127
Die!

70
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,881
Get up! Get up! Get up!

71
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,020
You recognized it?

72
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,857
It's the damn place where they made us
play Red Light, Green Light.

73
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,277
So many people played with us,
but now they're dead.

74
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,321
Everyone except for us, Gi-hun.

75
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,076
We…

76
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,287
we've already come too far
to end this now.

77
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,118
So it was you that killed them.

78
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,121
You… you killed everyone!

79
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,832
You killed them.

80
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,793
You're the one who killed them.

81
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,518
This game is over.

82
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,604
Yep, that about wraps it up.

83
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,347
I can't.

84
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,856
I wanna end here.

85
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,158
What is he doing?

86
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,993
-What the hell?
-What's going on?

87
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,745
Clause Three of the agreement.

88
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,040
The players are able to end the game when…

89
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,167
the majority agrees.

90
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,589
So if we both give up now,

91
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,676
you have to end it, right?

92
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,599
Player 456 wants to stop the game.

93
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,978
He's giving up the prize money

94
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,773
right… right here
at the very edge of victory?

95
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,859
No fucking way.

96
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,076
Sang-woo.

97
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,538
I just thought…

98
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,542
how they used to call our names when…

99
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,880
our moms had made supper for us.

100
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,760
That won't happen again.

101
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,391
Let's go.

102
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,149
Let's go together.

103
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,708
Gi-hun.

104
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm sorry.

105
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,807
Sang-woo!

106
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,143
Sang-woo…

107
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,729
Gi-hun.

108
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,192
No, Sang-woo. Don't talk.

109
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,861
-My mother, go help her.
-Don't talk, Sang-woo.

110
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,783
You have to help her.

111
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,160
Ah… No. Don't…

112
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,329
Sang-woo, don't…

113
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh, no!

114
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,176
No! Sang-woo, no…

115
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,639
You should celebrate.

116
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,267
That was quite the game there.

117
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,644
Why?

118
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,484
Why did you do it? How can you?

119
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,321
You bet on horses.

120
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,034
It's the same here but…

121
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,244
we bet on humans.

122
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,081
You're our horses.

123
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,335
I did not expect you to finish your race.

124
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,756
Who are you?

125
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,676
It was a dream. Just think of it that way.

126
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,014
And it really wasn't a bad one
for you, either.

127
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,016
Who are you?

128
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,815
Who are you?

129
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,737
Who are you?

130
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,909
Who are you?

131
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,204
Who are…

132
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,794
Believe in Jesus or burn in Hell!

133
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,838
You fool who deny the Lord's existence,

134
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,090
repent now!

135
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,009
The day of judgment is upon us!

136
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,179
Followers go to Heaven,
non-believers burn in Hell!

137
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:16,642
The only thing waiting for you
in the afterlife will be fire and pain!

138
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,478
Let us repent
and kneel down before the Lord!

139
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,732
Save yourself from Hell
by making Jesus your lord!

140
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,455
BELIEVE IN JESUS

141
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,641
Jesus. Praise the Lord.

Are you…

152
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,841
What happened? What's going on?

153
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,263
Did you get into another fight
while drinking?

154
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,768
Hold on. Wait right here.

155
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,033
Here's some mackerel.
I know your mother may want it.

156
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,792
She came down with something, I think.
She hasn't come out to work.

157
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,545
And it's been a few days
since she's answered her phone.

158
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,672
I should've stopped by to check on her.

159
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,009
I just don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, I, uh…

160
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,183
It's all right.

161
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,644
Give your mom any cash you got.
She needs it more than I do.

162
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,863
Gi-hun.

163
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,659
By any chance…

164
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,705
have you heard anything recently

165
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,916
from Sang-woo?

166
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,631
Never mind.

167
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,091
You should go.

168
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,824
Hey, Ma.

169
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm home.

170
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,257
Hey, Ma.

171
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,850
Mom, are you asleep?

172
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,145
Hey, Ma.

173
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,859
Mom, I'm home.

174
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,864
Come on.

175
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,787
I came home, Ma.

176
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,502
Hey, Ma.

177
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,716
Just, just open your eyes.

178
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:26,928
Come on.

179
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,025
I'm home now, Mom.

180
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,155
I got some money for us now.

181
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,094
1 YEAR LATER

182
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,934
We've got a real barista
working for us here,

183
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,644
and he can make you a cup as well.

184
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,147
I'm not sure if you'd like it that much.

185
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,691
Why am I here to see you?

186
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,612
Uh, sorry, you had to take the trip here.

187
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,406
I wanted to have a car
sent out to you, but…

188
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,908
Why am I here? What's wrong?

189
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,036
Uh, well…

190
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,918
So you see, you created your account here
quite a while ago and…

191
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,713
and you haven't made that much effort
to contact us since.

192
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,426
What do you mean?

193
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,639
Did I do something wrong?

194
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,265
Huh?

195
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,229
Uh, uh, no. It's nothing like that, sir.

196
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,360
Uh, you've got all your money set up
in a normal savings account.

197
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,655
You weren't earning
all that much interest on it.

198
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:37,536
And recently, our bank began offering
these consultations for VIPs

199
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,871
looking to expand their financial assets.

200
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,290
I wanted to let you know
that we're here to help.

201
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,627
I'm sure you're keeping busy.
I just wanted to say…

202
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,214
Oh. I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

203
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,718
Could you help me out with something else?

204
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,971
Okay, what can we do?

205
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,560
Please spare me just 10,000 won?

206
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,104
What?

207
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,022
Uh…

208
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,234
All right, yeah. Here, let me just…

209
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,030
Um…

210
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,274
Excuse me.

211
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,154
Would you buy some flowers?

212
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,240
Please, mister.

213
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,162
I need to get rid of them tonight
or they'll end up wilting away.

214
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,046
Thank you, mister.

215
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,882
I appreciate it.

216
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,842
Uh, here.

217
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,470
Have a good night.

218
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,138
DECEMBER 24, 11:30 P.M.
SKY BUILDING, 7TH FLOOR

219
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,973
FROM YOUR GGANBU

220
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,337
Pour some water in there.

221
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,513
Please, Gi-hun.

222
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,245
Who are you?

223
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,958
You explain this.

224
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,220
You see him?

225
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,430
That man down there?

226
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,560
He must be drunk…

227
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,273
because he's been sitting there for hours.

228
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,651
He looks homeless too

229
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,362
if I had to guess.

230
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,905
You…

231
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,827
Were you the one who's behind it?

232
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,831
He's going to freeze to death
if he stays out there any longer.

233
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,002
And no one is going over
to help or anything.

234
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,045
Why the hell did you do it?

235
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
Would you help out that guy?

236
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,260
Answer me!

237
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,597
Why did you do that to us?

238
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,642
You think that you will stop walking

239
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:41,608
and help that disgusting, stinking drunk,
little piece of trash, huh?

240
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,109
Show me who you are!

241
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,195
Why did I get to live and no one else?

242
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,780
Listen.

243
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,533
Let's play something tonight.

244
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,621
That man out there…

245
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,291
if he remains out there until midnight,

246
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,959
I win.

247
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,670
If anyone…

248
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,799
goes to help the drunk before then,

249
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,761
in that case, you win.

250
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,389
Cut the crap, okay?

251
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,769
I could easily snap your neck right here.

252
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,521
If you do that,

253
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,192
then you won't get to hear
my explanation for all this.

254
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,029
Play this game with me and…

255
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,156
I'll give you the…

256
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,867
answer to your question.

257
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,984
And if I win…

258
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,488
…then I'll kill you
without a second thought.

259
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:15,618
What will you… bet on it with then?

260
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,078
Anything.

261
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,917
It doesn't matter.
You might as well take everything I have.

262
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,931
So then…

263
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,517
who are you?

264
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,935
I earn…

265
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,564
a living, lending out money.

266
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,191
You give money to people for a living…

267
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,821
…and you get rich doing it?

268
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,906
Money.

269
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,909
You know what making money is like.

270
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,997
It's not simple to do.

271
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,666
So then…

272
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,795
was any of what you said true

273
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,631
or was it all just a lie?

274
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,469
Oh Il-nam.

275
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,014
Is that even your real name, huh?

276
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,599
It is.

277
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,768
Yes, that's real.

278
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,063
Oh Il-nam.

279
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,565
That tumor's also real.

280
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,986
And it also had gotten larger too.
That's true.

281
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,906
And the house

282
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,743
I used to live with my family in

283
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:44,248
was almost exactly like that one
in the alley. That's all true.

284
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,780
Can you still…

285
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,034
trust anybody to be good

286
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,329
even after everything you've been through?

287
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,873
Why did you send a card?

288
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,292
I heard that

289
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,338
all the money you won
is just sitting there

290
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,092
and that you are still living
like you used to.

291
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,390
Is it all just because you feel guilty?

292
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,814
Guilt? Shut up.

293
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,695
You don't feel any guilt
for what you did, do you?

294
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,321
It's yours now.

295
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,158
That cash is your reward

296
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,202
for your hard work and luck.

297
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,540
And you have every right to use it now.

298
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,251
Life goes by quick.

299
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,255
In one minute…

300
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,592
gone in a blink.

301
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,439
Why did you do
something like this?

302
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,359
Do you know

303
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,488
what someone who doesn't have any money

304
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,994
has in common with someone
with too much money

305
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,163
to know what to do with?

306
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,002
Living is…

307
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,005
no fun for either of them.

308
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,552
If you have too much money, then it…

309
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:07,683
doesn't matter what you buy,
or eat, or drink, or whatever.

310
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:13,439
Everything, well, it all gets boring.

311
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,860
All of my clients,

312
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:23,658
started to eventually say
the exact same things whenever we talked.

313
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,035
Everybody felt…

314
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:31,290
that there was no joy
in their lives anymore.

315
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,004
And so, we decided to get together.

316
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,549
We did a little bit of thinking.

317
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,720
What could we all do to…

318
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,266
finally have some fun?

319
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,475
Some fun?

320
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,815
You put us through all of that

321
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,776
so you can have fun?

322
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,403
It seems…

323
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:05,533
that you forgot how… no one had to play,

324
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,996
and you… all put your signatures
on the agreement.

325
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:17,628
And that you all made your decision
to come back on your own.

326
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, he's still out there.

327
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,895
It looks like you've run out of luck.

328
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,358
Tell me…

329
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:46,198
you still trust… in humanity being good?

330
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,201
I wanna know…

331
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,413
I wanna know why you joined us?

332
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,751
Oh, well, in my childhood

333
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,629
I always had

334
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:05,426
so much fun out doing things
with all of my friends.

335
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,056
We'd lose track of time for hours.

336
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,309
I wanted to just…

337
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,520
feel something

338
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,608
just one last time before I die.

339
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:26,947
And you are not going to get that feeling
if you are just going to spectate.

340
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,368
And I desperately wanted that.

341
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,244
And so…

342
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,624
did playing do that then?

343
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,834
Hell yeah.

344
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,963
You asked why I let you live.

345
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,341
By joining…

346
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,970
and playing with you…

347
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,890
I got that chance to…

348
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,684
feel again.

349
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,937
Thanks to you…

350
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,233
I got to remember

351
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,112
all these things that I had…

352
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,615
forgotten long ago.

353
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,703
It had been such a long time…

354
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,707
since I…

355
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,629
was able to have that much fun.

356
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,444
Look at that.

357
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,822
There's someone who cares.

358
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,867
You saw that, didn't you?

359
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,122
You saw that you lost.

360
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,409
And our guests,
greet them for me, all right?

361
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,371
Of course, sir,
but why not do it yourself?

362
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:28,629
Because I know that I'm not going to have
as much fun watching as playing.

363
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,236
INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT
RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY

367

Hmm.

Holy moly! Your hair, sir, grew out.

370
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,210
Uh, what you're getting done today?

371
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,170
Did you want a shorter cut?

372
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,215
Or keep it longer
so we can perm it like that, huh?

<i>The reason for the steep rise</i>

You must be Cheol.

380
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,268
The family resemblance is there.

381
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,524
Sir, do you know…

382
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,986
my sister very well?

383
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,824
I know her.

384
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,287
We're good friends.

385
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,707
Does that mean you know
where she is right now?

386
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,055
Is this the boy?

387
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,974
Yeah.

388
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,104
Tell me your name, sweetie.

389
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,481
It's Cheol.

390
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,858
Kang Cheol.

391
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,819
Kang Cheol?

392
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,029
How cool!
That's a manly name you have there.

393
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,533
And you look so tough and strong.

394
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,952
Take care of him, please.

395
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,412
Okay.

396
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,374
It'll be nice to have
a little extra company around

397
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,875
for dinner for a change.

398
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,253
Don't worry about me. Have a good trip.

399
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,754
Thanks.

400
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,144
Cheol, have you had dinner yet?

401
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,814
Here, come. Come and take a seat.
Come on now.

402
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,898
Have a fish bun.

403
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,568
Here you go.

404
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,865
Oh, goodness! That jacket
is way too light for this cold.

405
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,575
Wait, don't you have a warmer jacket?

406
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,891
IT'S THE MONEY I OWE SANG-WOO

412
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,476
I'll be boarding the flight soon.

413
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,606
Of course, of course, I got you a present.

414
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,151
No way. It's a secret.

415
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,946
I'll show it to you in person.

416
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,202
Hold on, Ga-yeong.

417
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,289
Ga-yeong, I'm gonna call you back
once I get there, okay?

418
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,751
I'll be there soon, honey.

419
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,805
Let's play again. Right now!

420
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,522
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,191
Give me back that card!

422
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,569
-Oh!
-No. You don't.

423
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,613
You don't go!

Listen carefully.

435
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,658
I'm not a horse.

436
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,452
I'm a person.

437
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,206
That's why I wanna know…

438
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,002
…who you people are,

<i>Don't get any absurd ideas.</i>

I can't forgive you…

444
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,895
