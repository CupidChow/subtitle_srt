1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,348
We're losing! Goddamn it!
Do something!

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,727
Get yourselves together and listen!

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,105
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,025
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,068
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,611
There's no way I'll do that!

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,030
We might as well try!

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,865
No way! I can't do it!

9
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,616
Move up or you'll die!

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,243
On count of three!

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,162
One! Two!

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,913
Three!

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,876
Oh!

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,839
Pull now!

15
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,202
Pull back more, you idiots!

16
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,733
EPISODE 5
A FAIR WORLD

17
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,713
Oh, Lord, protect me.

18
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,381
Hey, dude.

19
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,301
Who you think you're praying to, huh?

20
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,553
To God?

21
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,391
You think you made it out of there
because of God, don't you?

22
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,151
The reason you're still breathing
and thanking that nice God of yours…

23
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,361
is that old man there.

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,825
And that guy over there who came up
with that awesome last-minute trick.

25
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,621
You know if there's anybody
that you should be thanking

26
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,081
it's them, not God.

27
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,669
You sad lost soul.

28
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,130
What would you say about everybody
who was nailed to the cross

29
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,506
for our salvation today?

30
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,510
They sacrificed themselves for us.
We are here, thanks to their blood.

31
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,972
I pray to the Lord
on behalf of all us sinners.

32
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,682
I gave thanks for their sacrifice.

33
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,893
God made a decision to help our team win.

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,519
That's why we're all here.

35
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,646
Bullshit.

36
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,690
You killed those guys out there.

37
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,444
Oh!

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,530
If we say some prayers,
do we all get to go to heaven?

39
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,408
I should really pray too
if that's how easy it is.

40
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,661
Our God who art in Heaven,

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,038
we worked as a team
to send people to your side.

42
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,957
And we sent a bunch of them today.

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
And please help us
with a whole lot more to be with you.

44
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,045
-And I hope that from now on--
-Be quiet!

45
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,968
Me?

46
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,803
Or you mean that guy?

47
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,137
Everyone.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,702
What's your name, huh?

49
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,162
Why do you care about that?

50
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,540
So I can use your name, duh!

51
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,708
It doesn't matter.

52
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,876
So secretive.

53
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,629
Listen, okay.

54
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,756
Just leave me alone.

55
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,385
Well, you're the one
who asked me to join you guys.

56
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,352
Did you see that bald guy
wet his pants like a little baby?

57
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,439
Kids just keep blaming him how…

58
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,251
He's not breathing.
Go get that doctor.

59
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,426
You know what? I really thought
we were going to die out there.

60
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,846
And then, as soon as we're all
leaning back, I felt so powerful.

61
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
Like, "Whoa! It works. Is this real?"

62
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,391
Hey, old man, how do you know that?

63
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,437
-As a kid, I would always--
-Oh, you copied that one thing.

64
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,814
From that movie. What's it called?

65
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,566
The guy who dodges bullets like this.

66
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,567
-Right?
<i>-Matrix.</i>

67
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,403
Hmm.

68
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,074
Hey, when you got to Korea,
is all you did watch movies?

69
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,744
And our man…

70
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,248
"Everybody, three steps up when I signal."

71
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,334
Oh. My God, I can't believe
how cool that was.

72
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,670
How did you come up with it
under all that pressure?

73
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,297
Earlier, you were the one who said no.

74
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
Yeah?

75
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,302
Was that what you heard?

76
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,595
You cried and said,

77
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,973
"But that's the edge.
There's no way I'll go."

78
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,932
Like that.

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,728
Hey, you. You got a visa? I bet you don't.

80
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,646
You're an illegal alien.

81
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
Hey, boys, how about it?

82
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,151
Why keep the strange foreigner
when we could just ditch him?

83
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,528
Our team's more secure that way, huh?

84
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,781
Guess I'd better do some major
restructuring while I'm here.

85
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,533
Who's captain here, guys?

86
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,121
Mr. Brains, you've been captain, right?

87
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,750
There's no captain. We're all equal here.

88
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,919
Ah! That's great.

89
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,755
Building an egalitarian society!

90
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,216
Damn, guys.

91
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,593
I gotta say this is quite a change
from that huge asshole

92
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,221
who just bosses you around
and pretend he's king.

93
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,431
Oh, about that, grandma,
why did you get kicked out?

94
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,976
Grandma?

95
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,312
Don't you ever call me that!

96
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,066
Here, Han Mi-nyeo.

97
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,360
Got it? Mi-nyeo. That's my name.

98
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,780
And I didn't get kicked out.

99
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,782
I made the decision to go, all right?

100
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,369
Those crazy thugs there?
You can't lock me in with that crew.

101
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,870
They only got rid of you,

102
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,039
then they only wound up with male players.

103
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,749
Right before the game at that.

104
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,835
You know, it's almost like
they knew about it ahead of time.

105
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>Players,</i>
<i>your bedtime will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

106
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,181
<i>Please return to your assigned beds</i>
<i>and prepare for lights-out.</i>

107
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,934
Another fight
could break out like last night.

108
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,143
We should make a plan.

109
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,937
What can we do, huh?

110
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,897
We've got three girls and old man and us.

111
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,649
Our team is the weakest one in here.

112
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,485
We should choose a weak team
and go after them first.

113
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,282
For a resident priest,
you sure are bloodthirsty.

114
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,033
I mean, everybody's hands are bloody.

115
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,870
We're all sinners,
but we're still here, aren't we?

116
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,792
Attacking is our best option.
So I think that's our plan.

117
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,669
During the fight last night,

118
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,298
the man in the bed
in front of me got killed.

119
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,218
And the person he thought
was on his side broke his neck.

120
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,305
Do you trust me then?

121
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,225
I don't trust one person here.

122
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,522
All right.

123
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,025
I think let's still do something.

124
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,818
Before the lights go out,

125
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,403
let's create a barricade.

126
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,448
It might be good to make sure
that we have cover.

127
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,741
Mm-hm.

128
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,103
Hey, Ssangmun-dong.

129
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,609
Hey, I appreciate the work you're doing.

130
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,111
Nice.

131
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,280
But do you think these will do anything?

132
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,575
We can get through all of this easily.

133
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,411
You're not worried at all?

134
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,415
Those scumbags you got
on your side over there?

135
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,125
They're people you trust?

136
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,510
Go. Come on.

137
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,220
If that was me there…

138
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,141
once the fighting starts to happen,

139
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,228
you'll be the first person I'd go for.

140
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,400
You're the strongest person here.

141
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,244
What…

142
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,377
Boss.

143
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,921
So who's our first target, huh?

144
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,339
Let's take the night off.

145
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,091
How come?

146
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,636
-I mean shouldn't we try to cut down the--
-Do what I tell you to do.

147
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,346
Oh.

148
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,723
Sure.

149
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,392
Hey.

150
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,729
Cut that out. We all need to rest tonight.

151
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,153
Where'd the doc go?

152
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,574
He just left. He went to the restroom
while you're gone.

153
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,783
They'll shut off the lights soon.

154
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,659
They might not all come right away.

155
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,829
So we better swap out who's gonna
keep watch, just to be safe, I think.

156
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,997
No, two of us should watch.

157
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,292
A pair can keep each other awake.

158
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,378
Just one person might go leave
and betray our team.

159
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,299
I can…

160
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,468
be first watch then.

161
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,638
You don't really sleep a lot
when you're old.

162
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,848
Excuse me, but are we just
supposed to trust

163
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,643
an old man like you
to not sleep on the job all night?

164
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,397
Let me go first.

165
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,319
I'm not tired yet.

166
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,321
I'll go with you.

167
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,824
Then I'll be next.

168
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,368
You wake me up the second you get tired.

169
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,955
Then why don't I join you on second watch?

170
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,374
Assuming that's okay with you.

171
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,668
Yeah, that sounds good.

172
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>The work schedule is done for today.</i>

173
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,772
<i>All active staff,</i>
<i>please return to your rooms immediately.</i>

174
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,862
<i>I repeat. Active staff,</i>
<i>please return to your rooms immediately.</i>

175
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,675
Have some of this.

176
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,387
I saved this earlier
when they gave it to us for supper.

177
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,472
So I could give it to you.

178
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,349
Give it to me. What'd I do?

179
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,561
Today, you saved my life.
It's that simple.

180
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,355
I wanted to thank you.

181
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,732
I'm flattered but…

182
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,859
I just didn't wanna die.

183
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,986
You gave me that money for the bus too.

184
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,781
I just wanted to return the favor.

185
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,957
Your share.

186
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,466
It's Ali. Is that right?

187
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,384
How old are you?

188
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,930
Ali, yes. I'm 33, mister.

189
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
Just call me Sang-woo, okay?

190
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,644
You sure about that…

191
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
Sang-woo?

192
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,071
How did you get here?

193
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,032
I came to Korea to make money,

194
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,034
Sang-woo.

195
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,411
I don't mean that. In here.

196
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,246
The game.

197
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,916
I needed money.

198
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,834
I came for that.

199
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,966
Got family?

200
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,682
Pakistan. Got my dad and mother
and siblings there.

201
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,104
I still had to take the wife and baby
with me here.

202
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,188
You're a father?

203
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,233
How old is your kid?

204
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,985
He's a year-old boy.

205
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,656
You miss them a lot?

206
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,909
Yes.

207
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,541
What's your reason for being…

208
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,835
in here?

209
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,549
The same as you.

210
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,718
For money.

211
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,091
29, what happened yesterday?

212
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,259
Where were you?

213
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,012
Sorry.

214
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,347
"Sorry"?

215
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,478
I stopped the other guys from killing you
because they didn't trust you.

216
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,733
Since you saved my life
during the last dive, we're even now.

217
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,237
If you do that again, you're out.

218
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,396
Number 29. So you're finally here.

219
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,649
I gave him a warning.

220
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,859
We couldn't make the delivery last night.

221
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,820
We can't let it slide with only a warning!

222
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,988
Then you can deliver this yourself.

223
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,284
You think it's easy
to find divers like us in this place?

224
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,162
Make sure tonight's
delivery goes off without a hitch.

225
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,006
What?
You aren't even done with one?

226
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,093
The doctor is slow today.
More so than usual.

227
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,220
Hey, quack. Hurry it up.

228
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,764
This is all pointless
if the boat leaves before we deliver.

229
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,018
You come over here and try doing this,
especially when you're sleep deprived.

230
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,730
I'm just barely escaping death
every damn day.

231
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,705
That's why we tell you
what the games are beforehand

232
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,665
and gave that extra food.

233
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,020
Gi-hun.

234
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,188
Huh? Sang-woo.

235
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,565
-You ready to switch?
-Ah…

236
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,067
Okay.

237
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,574
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

238
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,452
Looked like you were having
a nightmare just now.

239
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,330
Oh, no, no. It's all good.

240
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,374
Hey.

241
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,002
What are you doing up?

242
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,965
I can't keep my eyes shut.

243
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,052
Well, you should really try
to get some rest.

244
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,179
I'll keep everybody safe tonight.

245
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,725
Glad you got our backs tonight, kid.

246
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,146
Heard from the doctor yet?

247
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,566
No. This is weird.
He's taking too long.

248
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,864
Hold this.

249
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,663
We're in a hurry.
Maybe I should try working on those?

250
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,124
I bet I could do it
if you teach me a few tricks.

251
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,669
Yeah. You think all of this
is so simple, huh.

252
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,047
I saw on the news
doctors don't always perform surgeries.

253
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,466
Sometimes it's the office managers
or nurse's aides.

254
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,719
And some of them are better
than the doctors are.

255
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,930
You think you know so much?
Then how about you try?

256
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,767
Who would have thought
a quack who killed his own patient

257
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,852
would still be so proud about his work?

258
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,648
If you were so good, how come you ruined
the eyes you pulled out last time?

259
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,817
Those Chinese guys busted my ass!

260
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,443
Listen, I'll tell you what went wrong.

261
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,987
That thing was still alive
when I got here.

262
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,739
How'd you expect me to operate
with all of that struggling?

263
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,574
We don't have time for this.

264
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,368
The boat will be here soon.

265
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,793
Gi-hun.

266
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,599
Hey.

267
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,272
So, uh, what's going on? Are you okay?

268
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,818
I thought you were sleeping
with your eyes open.

269
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,029
Um…

270
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,782
Thinking of the old days.

271
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,325
The old days, huh?

272
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,205
I worked at this place once
where we went on strike.

273
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,376
Had a barricade just like this one.

274
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,545
What did you do
when you were working there?

275
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,714
I used to make parts for cars.

276
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,175
Hmm. Ah.

277
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,135
Why did you strike?

278
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,389
They fired a bunch of us all at once.

279
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,518
I've been employed there
more than a decade.

280
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,356
I bet it wasn't easy.

281
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,530
I had a kid on the way too.

282
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,741
I couldn't afford to get fired like that.

283
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,830
Our bosses said we couldn't stay.
I had no other option.

284
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,543
They ruined the company
and held us responsible.

285
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,546
It made me furious.

286
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,550
And everyone same as now…

287
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,886
…all kept watching in pairs until morning.

288
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,972
That way, no one could kick us all out.

289
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,893
And we were all so scared.

290
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,063
Police might come any second.

291
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,150
I remember. I heard about it back then.

292
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,196
There was a huge strike.
Some car company. That's right.

293
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,869
I think the news turned it
into this crazy story.

294
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,998
That was it.
Someone died there too, right?

295
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,667
Mmm.

296
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,627
I'm sorry.

297
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,880
My goodness.

298
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,673
I don't know…

299
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,134
why I said all of that.

300
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,802
Mmm.

301
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,515
Oh.

302
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,232
Do you need help, sir?

303
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,235
What's going on?

304
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,821
Oh.

305
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,158
-You're burning up.
-No, no, it's fine. I'm fine.

306
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,619
I nearly pissed myself that night.

307
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,039
I thought the thing was dead,
but then it shot up like a zombie.

308
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,791
It started glaring at me
with one of its eyes popping out.

309
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,753
I saw it in my dream last night.

310
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,630
Everyone who got eliminated

311
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,257
in Red Light, Green Light
was shot by a sniper rifle.

312
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,009
We could hardly salvage anything.

313
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,222
That zombie looked promising.
At least before we saw inside.

314
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,433
I almost died
making the delivery that day.

315
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,686
But we didn't even get full price
because it only had one kidney.

316
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,105
It's my fault the zombie
was missing a kidney?

317
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,525
Hopefully,
this guy is all right.

318
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,238
Most people who came here either signed
away their bodies or are terminally ill.

319
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,114
This one better be worth it.

320
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,496
Here. Lie down.

321
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,498
Wait right here.

322
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,793
Okay. We need to lower your fever.
Hold on.

323
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,340
Ah, shit.

324
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,758
Here. Use this.

325
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,726
<i>So what happened…</i>

326
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,397
to that zombie?

327
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,483
What do you think happened to it?

328
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,487
We were in a hurry,
so I beat it to death with that.

329
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,702
Hold on.
Why do you need to ask?

330
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,203
You were there for the whole thing.

331
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,454
What the hell?

332
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,164
Don't you remember?

333
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,169
Back then…

334
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,423
I was a bit out of it.

335
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,008
You were out of it?

336
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,262
You got rid of the body
with your own hands.

337
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,140
Number 29.

338
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,185
-You haven't been--
-This is my operating room, okay?

339
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,898
Stop chatting and do what I say,
so I can actually do some work!

340
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,694
Just let me work in peace, okay?

341
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,903
If you don't shut up,

342
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,656
I'll cut right through his liver
and kidneys just like this! Damn it!

343
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,296
Thank you, friend.

344
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,594
Just you rest now.

345
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,639
After all, we can't…

346
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,350
start the next game without you.

347
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,111
You should go and rest.

348
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,781
I can handle this alone.

349
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,325
We agreed to do pairs.

350
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,036
And I'm already awake now.

351
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,208
Thanks so much.

352
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,297
For this.

353
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,592
It wasn't for free.

354
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,595
You can pay me back tomorrow.

355
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,280
Hurry up.

356
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,533
They're all in great condition this time.

357
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,076
Make sure you get full price.

358
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,130
Pick up the pace.
The boat's already here.

359
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,356
All right, I'm done.

360
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,816
What game is up next?

361
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,359
We don't know yet.

362
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,319
What'd you say?

363
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,196
Bullshit.

364
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,240
We haven't been told what it is yet.

365
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,908
You better go and ask your boss.

366
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,453
There must be somebody up there
you can go ask.

367
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,621
If he knew,
he would've told us already.

368
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,541
-I'm sure there's a reason.
-It sounds like that's on you.

369
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,544
I did everything you said to.

370
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,838
Go tell them to find out this second!

371
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,423
Go back and wait!

372
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,300
I'll tell you before the next game begins.

373
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,303
This is a bunch of bullshit!

374
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,823
What are you doing?

375
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,783
Pull.

376
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,286
-Calm down.
-Tell me what the game is,

377
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,455
or else I'm gonna end up
getting killed tonight!

378
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,792
This isn't the way to handle things.
Give us more time.

379
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,044
I'm not giving you
any more time, assholes!

380
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,047
-Then what do you suggest?
-Check what's next and come back.

381
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,675
And you…

382
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,135
you'll be staying right here
until he returns, okay?

383
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,555
It'll be more dangerous if we stay here.

384
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,515
We have to get back
before morning roll call!

385
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,767
I don't care about any of that shit!

386
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,729
No, I'm not going anywhere
until I know what it is.

387
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,524
Fine, okay. Calm down.

388
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,986
Go up and find out what the game is.

389
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,488
Okay.

390
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,036
Wait!

391
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,163
You have to take the key.

392
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,500
The key to upstairs
is in my right side pocket.

393
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,295
Don't try to pull something.

394
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,588
I'm not.

395
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,090
He needs it to get into the control room.

396
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,885
If you don't trust me,
you can throw it to him yourself.

397
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,176
Don't touch it.

398
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:13,890
It's a bomb. They made this passage
so the VIPs could escape in an emergency.

399
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,516
And once they're all out,

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,977
they set that off
and blow the entire place.

401
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,064
The VIPs? Who are they?

402
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,566
That's as much as I know.

403
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,214
Number 29.

404
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,143
Are you there?
The doctor escaped.

405
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,026
Damn it.

406
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,320
Shit.

407
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,709
Shit!

408
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,023
Why do you wanna know
who the VIPs are?

409
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,234
I was just grateful

410
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,863
for our diving equipment and this passage.

411
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,407
They prepared it all for us.

412
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,784
Not only are you more curious,

413
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,703
but your voice seems to have changed.

414
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,288
Let me see your face.

415
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,083
Do you have to do this?

416
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,755
Do you wanna die?

417
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,894
Who are you?

418
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,572
Now show me yours.

419
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,867
Do you wanna die?

420
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,430
Stay away!

421
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,351
Calm down.
We can still fix this.

422
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,685
How will you do that?

423
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,230
Using that gun?

424
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,648
Think about it.

425
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,399
Why would I kill you anyway?

426
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,318
That'll only complicate things.

427
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,112
It's complicated already.

428
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,280
I had to kill your friend.

429
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,824
He wasn't a friend.

430
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:22,203
Look, listen.
I can throw bodies in the incinerator.

431
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,580
The guy you killed, I'll just cremate him.

432
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,750
It's a huge problem
when a player goes missing,

433
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,628
but when it's soldier,
no one cares about that.

434
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,298
Who I am

435
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,510
doesn't matter right now, you got that?

436
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,352
Now, what matters is the identity
of the man that you murdered here.

437
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,689
The one you've been calling a zombie.

438
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,568
With the one kidney, the one you put
on the table who woke up.

439
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,737
You know where that other kidney went?

440
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,781
In here.

441
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,908
It's in here.

442
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,413
He was my brother.

443
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,915
-He gave me that kidney.
-No, no, wait!

444
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,003
It was a girl.

445
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,296
Not a man.

446
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,672
I'm not lying.

447
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,716
I'll find out what the next game is.

448
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,510
If you make a bigger scene and get caught,

449
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,679
we'll both die for nothing.

450
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,806
Trust me.

451
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,766
We still have a chance.

452
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,227
How can I trust someone like you, scumbag?

453
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,746
Look.

454
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,582
Now you see, we're all the same here.

455
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:03,930
All right.

456
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,682
You just need to go back quietly.

457
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,727
If you go back before your bedtime is up…

458
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,772
you and I can live through this.

459
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,614
Then what do I have to do?

460
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,411
Listen, doctor.

461
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,419
Let's get you washed up
before anything else.

462
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,301
I'm not lying!

463
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,804
It was a girl.

464
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,555
It sounds like bullshit.

465
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,225
Before we operated on her,

466
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,603
we took turns having sex
with the girl, okay?

467
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,022
Would we have done that to a guy?

468
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,234
Go check the list,
if you still don't trust me.

469
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,028
-What list?
-There's a list of all the players

470
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,738
with all their info as well.

471
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,116
-Even their medical records.
-Where?

472
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,454
Over the ladderway in…

473
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,748
the room the leader is in.

474
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
Leader?

475
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,251
You've seen him.

476
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,420
His mask isn't the same.

477
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,433
And so, you and I
will find your brother, okay?

478
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,395
And I'll give you all the money I got
selling organs!

479
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,482
Once we're a team, we'll be, uh--

480
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,751
Whether you sell
the dead bodies' organs

481
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,254
or eat them or whatever,
I don't give a damn.

482
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,592
However, you ruined the most important
aspect of this place.

483
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,848
Equality.

484
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,185
Everyone is equal
while they play this game.

485
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,397
Here, every player gets to play
a fair game under the same conditions.

486
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,735
These people suffered from inequality
and discrimination out in the world,

487
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,947
and we're giving them one last chance
to fight fair and win.

488
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,826
But you broke that principle.

489
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,331
Sir, I'm sorry.

490
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,717
Sir. We found the rest.

491
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,202
That was 28.

492
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,453
There's one more.

493
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,622
The one who killed this one.

494
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,374
He could've escaped to the sea already.

495
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,379
No oxygen tanks are missing.

496
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,048
He's still here somewhere.

497
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,424
Find him.

Find him.

502
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,811
He's not on the security cameras.

503
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,900
He has to be in here.

504
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,991
<i>Attention. All players,</i>

505
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,077
<i>please make your way</i>

506
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,121

507
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,914
<i>-Attention. All players…</i>
-All of you, go.

508
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,458
<i>please make your way</i>
<i>to the center of the room.</i>

509
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,254
Hey, move it.

510
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,550
What's going on in here? Shit.

511
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,429
Hey, boss, about the doctor,
he's not here.

512
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,058
Get up.

513
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,769
Get up.

514
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,022
Now!

515
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,442
Listen. He's very sick right now, sir.
