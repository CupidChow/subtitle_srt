1
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>In my town, we had a game</i>
<i>called the "Squid Game."</i>

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>We called it that because it's played</i>
<i>in a court shaped like a squid.</i>

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

4
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>Children are divided into two groups,</i>
<i>the offense and the defense.</i>

5
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:44,002
<i>Once the game starts, the defense</i>
<i>can run around on two feet within bounds,</i>

6
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,048
<i>while the offense outside the lines</i>
<i>are only allowed to hop on one foot.</i>

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,510
It's your mom.

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>But if an attacker cuts through</i>
<i>the waist of the squid passing defense,</i>

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>then they are given freedom</i>
<i>to use both feet.</i>

10
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,319
Inspector royal.

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,780
<i>Inspector royal.</i>

12
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>For whatever reason,</i>
<i>we called that the inspector royal.</i>

13
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>When we were ready for the final battle,</i>

14
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>all the attackers gathered</i>
<i>at the entrance to the squid.</i>

15
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,545
Go.

16
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,090
<i>In order to win,</i>

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>the attackers must tap</i>
<i>the small closed-off space</i>

18
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>on the squid's head with their foot.</i>

19
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>But if someone on the defense</i>
<i>manages to push you</i>

20
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,476
<i>outside of the squid's boundaries,</i>

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,645
<i>you die.</i>

22
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>That's right. You die.</i>

23
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,334
Victory!

24
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,585
<i>Victory.</i>

25
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,965
<i>Once you tap the squid's head,</i>
<i>you win and yell out, "Victory."</i>

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I felt as if I owned the entire world,</i>

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>exhilarated.</i>

28
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,535
EPISODE 1
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

29
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,830
Ah.

30
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,583
Um…

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,043
Is this my daily allowance or what?

32
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,465
No. Remember,
Ga-yeong's birthday is today?

33
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,678
Yeah. Of course, I do.

34
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,808
And don't forget, go and get her,
uh, something for dinner later.

35
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,061
Well, I can't buy her a nice meal
with these much. Times are tough.

36
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,648
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

37
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,234
Go buy her some fried chicken.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,111
Just chicken, Mom?

39
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,530
Don't you think I should get
a present for her?

40
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,823
Give me some more, huh?

41
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,117
I'm broke.

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,952
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,663
I gave you everything I made chauffeuring.

44
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,665
Oh, please, that petty change?

45
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,836
Hey, we can't even pay your loan's
monthly interest off with that.

46
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,173
We can't do that now,
and we barely spend anything.

47
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,091
Let's use some when we have to.

48
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
Goodness.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,596
Oh.

50
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,811
And will you stop working so much?

51
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,564
Make sure you soak
the dishes after you're done.

52
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,653
You don't even make that much,
plus you're pulling your back out!

53
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,124
Ah!

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,348
DAEHAN BANK

55
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,349
ENTER YOUR PIN

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,769
Huh?

57
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,895
Hey.

58
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,146
It should be my birthday.

59
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,607
-No way.
-Pin number changed on you, huh?

60
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
I guess your mother finally abandoned you.

61
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,696
Hold on.

62
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,824
Huh?

63
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,618
Oh, shit.
What did that woman change it to, huh?

64
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,203
Try her birthday or, or something.

65
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,705
Her birthday?

66
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,456
Her birthday.

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,374
Um, uh…

68
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,751
You're telling me you don't know
your own mother's birthday?

69
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,003
-Any kid knows that.
-Hey!

70
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,130
-Don't say that. I do know.
-Hey.

71
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,925
She celebrates it going by the lunar date,
meaning it's not the same every year.

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,678
-Use your brain for once.
-Then put in the lunar date.

73
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,431
Come on. Work!

74
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,517
Oh, goddamn it!

75
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,353
Oh, shit.

76
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,647
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.

77
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,649
They'll block your card
if you get it wrong again.

78
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,735
You really gotta think about this one.

79
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,831
<i>Please select</i>
<i>the amount you would like to withdraw.</i>

80
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,334
Oh!

81
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,210
What was it? Your birthday?

82
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,754
My kid's. It's today.

83
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,881
Ah! The old woman cares
about her granddaughter

84
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,466
more than her own son.

85
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,509
Ah, shit.

86
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,428
-<i>Number nine…</i>
-Go, go, go.

87
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,138
-Come on!
-Come on!

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,894
-Come on!
-Go, go!

89
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,563
Go! Yeah, come on. Go! Go!

90
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,899
Go, go!

91
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,525
Let's go.

92
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,319
Let's go!

93
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,280
Go! Go! Faster!

94
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,785
Dang!

95
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,246
You told me that I was gonna win this.
Goddamn it!

96
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,166
Stupid little jerk.

97
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,836
How could you lose
with an animal like that?

98
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,847
<i>Attention. Betting</i>
<i>for the tenth race is about to end.</i>

99
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>Please place your final bet.</i>

100
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,018
-<i>I repeat. Betting for the tenth race…</i>

101
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,813
<i>…is about to end.</i>
<i>Please place your final bet.</i>

102
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,564
Hey, buddy.

103
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,193
-Hey, what are you-- Ooh!
-Please don't touch me!

104
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,196
How about you leave me alone?
Can't you see I'm trying to think?

105
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,707
Okay.

106
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>No. 9 Baekil Legend</i>
<i>is placed right in the middle.</i>

107

That's it.

108
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
Come on.

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,510
Go, come on.

110
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,679
Go. Okay. Yeah.

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,182
That's it. Come on, come on!

112
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,060
Come on! Faster! Faster! Come on.

113
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,648
Yeah. Oh!

114
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,525
<i>No. 6, Thunderflash,</i>

<i>Second place from…</i>

120
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,250
I did it, man. Six and eight!

121
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,629
-Why did you choose six, anyway?
-Oh!

122
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,839
Damn! What did I say?

123
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,593
Today's June 8th. Six and eight!
The day my daughter was born!

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,974
-Four and a half million won.
-Oh, thanks so much.

125
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,687
Here. A little something for you.
Thanks again.

126
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,439
-What do I get?
-Come on!

127
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,150
Hey, wait up for me, asshole!

128
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,569
OFF TRACK BETTING

129
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,992
I hope you're excited. Uh-huh!
I'll pick you up after school, okay?

130
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,498
Fried chicken?

131
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,292
Hey, you can get something
really expensive tonight, huh!

132
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,544
Don't worry about the price at all,
okay? Hmm?

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,505
Mm, mm, mm…

134
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,674
Think about what you wanna eat
and make me a list during recess.

135
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,051
Okay, honey?

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,678
I'll see you at seven then.

137
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,391
Look forward to it.

138
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,893
You're not gonna believe what…

139
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,146
Hey! Hey, Gi-hun!

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,105
Hey!

141
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,525
Long time no see, huh!

142
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,028
Hey, Ga-yeong, hold on, right.
I love you too. Okay, bye.

143
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,821
-Huh?
-Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,281
-He's running!
-Get him!

145
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,494
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.

146
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,037
Oh.

147
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,622
Oh!

148
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,375
Oh.

149
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,709
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,796
Hey, kid, you okay? Oh. Shit!

151
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,050
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, get him!

152
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,636
Get him!
Over there! Over there!

153
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,266
Wait a minute. Let me stand up.

154
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,769
Okay. Just… Look, I got cash for real.

155
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,271
Oh, yeah?

156
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,064
Uh-huh.

157
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,316
-Then why did you run, huh?
-Because I…

158
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,280
I, I've been saving up so I…
I could pay you all the ones that I took.

159
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,826
Goodness, what a trooper. Look at you.

160
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,286
So then, how much you got?

161
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,662
Four million.

162
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,583
Take this amount now.
I'll pay the rest next month, so…

163
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,793
What…

164
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,007
Oh!

165
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,341
Hey, kid, you okay?

166
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,219
Oh.

167
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,721
Let me see. Oop, oop, oop, opp, oop,

168
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,639
Come on, let me see.

169
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,474
Poor thing.

170
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,771
Ahh…

171
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,232
Got a sweet taste of it.

172
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,068
I guess you're still eating well.
Spending the money you know is mine.

173
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,695
I swear I had it…

174
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,155
I had it, I had your money.

175
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,199
Look, I bet on six and eight and they won,
so I had the cash right here.

176
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,117
Hey.

177
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,127
Do you know why
nosebleeds are so easy to get, huh?

178
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,964
Because there are so many capillaries.

179
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,008
Oh, no. Hey, don't do this.

180
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,093
-I don't wanna die.
-Your blood was tasty.

181
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,639
I think my boys and I
should make a nice delicious soup in it.

182
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,849
I'll pay you!

183
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,394
I'll pay you. I mean it. I'll pay you.

184
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,480
Jesus, guy.

185
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't make me feel sorry for you
with all that crying.

186
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,151
How did you know I was such a softie?

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,031
Hey.

188
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,451
Okay, wipe off your tears.

189
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,328
Sign here and your fingerprint.

190
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,291
If you don't pay it off by next month,
I'll take one of your kidneys.

191
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,836
And then after that,
I'll take one of your eyes. Okay?

192
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,632
-You don't like it?
-No, uh, I got it. Yeah.

193
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,551
Next month is good with me.

194
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,345
-Here.
-Okay.

195
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,055
Well, I, I need ink.

196
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,228
There, you got your ink.
It's all natural too.

197
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,480
Huh?

198
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,523
Oh.

199
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
That's it. Right there.

200
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,861
DISCLAIMER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

201
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,573
You did it, huh!

202
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,368
You have one month. Take care of yourself.

203
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,870
Uh, hold on. Sir, excuse me.

204
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,209
I'm sorry to even ask but…

205
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,753
may I please borrow 10,000 won?

206
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
You little…

207
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,677
Forget it.

208
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,095
WINDOW CLOSED

209
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,473
Excuse me.

210
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,351
Sorry to do this.

211
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,146
Uh…

212
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,689
Can I get back that 10,000?

213
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,818
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

214
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,162
Come on.

215
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,209
Ah!

216
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,844
Yeah. Come on. That's it, that's it.

217
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,679
That's right. Ah!

218
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,226
Goddamn it!

219
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,729
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,732
You need to stop and pick the prize
you want first.

221
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,817
Does that help you?

222
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,706
Ah. Ah…

223
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,000
That's it. Good.

224
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,002
Yes, that's it.

225
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,879
-Oh!
-Yay!

226
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,342
Yay!

227
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,971
Great job! Thank you. Thank you!

228
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,557
Yay!

229
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,358
Oh, this?

230
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,487
It's a huge mosquito bite, that's all.

231
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
Mosquitoes are really mean
these days. Yeah.

232
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,330
Dad, you can be
in all of the fights that you want,

233
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,499
but don't get hurt too bad.

234
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,130
I'm sorry, sweetie. I really am.

235
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,468
You know, I wanted to buy you
a nicer dinner than this.

236
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,469
It's okay.

237
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,515
We went with my stepdad
to a steakhouse earlier, so…

238
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,853
A steak, huh?

239
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,523
That's nice of him.

240
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,695
Well, I still want <i>tteokbokki</i>
a lot more, though.

241
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,825
I'm not allowed to have it at home.

242
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,410
Mom says it's junk food.

243
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,746
Eat up then.

244
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,249
Oh, my gosh.

245
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,584
Surprise.

246
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,837
Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.

247
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,301
Ah…

248
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,806
Uh…

249
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,145
You know why, huh?
These days, even women go to war.

250
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,271
Uh-huh.

251
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,814
I mean, when you finally get older,

252
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,859
there's not gonna be that kind
of discrimination like we got now.

253
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,236
And you'll need to get used to this
pretty soon, you know.

254
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,825
Ah.

255
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh, plus, it's a lighter.

256
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,041
Looks like the real deal, doesn't it?

257
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,420
I think you'll get in trouble
with Mom again

258
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,881
if she saw me holding this.

259
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,257
Is that right?

260
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,094
I'll keep it then, just till you get
a little bit older. Okay?

261
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,888
Hey, don't smoke of it, though.

262
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,306
Oh, come on, I'm clean now.

263
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,940
All right. All right.

264
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,068
I'll make sure I'll stop smoking for real.

265
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,738
And you'll see next year, huh,
I'll get an awesome present for you, okay?

266
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,907
Ga-yeong, I swear.

267
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,242
Next year?

268
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,869
Last year, you had a birthday.

269
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,496
This one came right around, right?

270
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,956
And the next one will be quick.

271
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,500
Um, Dad?

272
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,835
Hmm? Shoot.

273
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,924
Nothing.

274
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,304
Okay. Come on, come on.
Have more <i>tteokbokki</i>.

275
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,641
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

276
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,559
And mix it with some of that in.

277
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,119
Why did you bring her back so late?

278
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,537
She's not dressed for the cold.

279
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,123
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

280
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,959
We're ten minutes late at most. Okay?

281
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,794
I said I'd drive down
to get her, didn't I?

282
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,088
It's her birthday. Let's not yell.

283
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,132
Mom.

284
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,342
-Oh.
-Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,137
I'll carry her to the elevator
if you don't mind, okay?

286
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,513
She can walk on her own.

287
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,597
Mom…

288
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,225
-Ga-yeong, get down.
-Ah, jeez. Seriously.

289
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,686
All right. Let's go.

290
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,153
Bye, Dad.

291
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,779
Go on in. Good night.

292
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,876
Ah, wait a minute!
Hey, open the door!

293
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,335
Ah, shit!

294
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,241
Hello, sir.

295
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,368
Can I talk to you?

296
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,165
I don't believe in Jesus.

297
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,626
It's not that.

298
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,213
Listen, I wanna let you in
on a great opportunity to…

299
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,890
I come from a very long line of Buddhists,
so find another guy to preach to,

300
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,560
Mister.

301
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,730
Would you like to play a game with me?

302
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,275
Who are you?

303
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,903
Salesman, huh?

304
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,156
You people have all kinds of tactics.

305
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,078
And I know you're only doing your job,
but I really don't have time to sit here…

306
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,627
I'm sure you've
played <i>ddakji</i> before, right?

307
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,131
Play a few round of <i>ddakji</i> with me.

308
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,967
And each time you win,
I'll pay you a 100,000 won.

309
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,977
Wait, so if I hit your <i>ddakji</i>,
and it flips over,

310
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,688
I get a 100,000 won?

311
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,358
And if I can flip yours, you will give me
the exact same amount of money.

312
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,574
You can also be the first to play.

313
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,456
Hey, look, I had a bad day today.

314
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,461
You pull a scam or you rip me off,
well, then, I'll… I'll kill you, huh?

315
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,882
So then it's my turn, eh?

316
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,386
So which color do you wanna play as?

317
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,687
Shh…

318
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,378
Well, what's wrong?

319
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,589
So the thing is…

320
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,176
How about you use your body to pay?

321
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,136
A what?

322
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,139
What the hell, man?

323
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,391
I'll take a 100 grand off per slap.

324
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,814
One more round.

325
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,070
One more round.

326
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,478
Oh! Ah!

327
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,971
Did you see that? I beat you, man!

328
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,974
Did you see that? I did it. I won.

329
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,060
Get over here. It's my turn to do this.

330
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,105
What are you doing, jerk?

331
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,566
Your 100 grand.

332
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,821
You're welcome, sir.

333
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,494
Oh, yeah.

334
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,913
The money.

335
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,257
You know, sir.

336
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,010
There are other games like this
where you can make even more.

337
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,638
Come on, it must sound tempting.

338
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,349
Hey, dude.

339
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,726
Is this some new pyramid scheme or what?

340
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,896
Look, I'm desperate, okay?

341
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,065
Still, not that desperate yet.

342
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,238
Mr. Gi-hun.

343
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,951
Earlier, you signed away
your physical rights.

344
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,956
Your name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

345
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,750
You attended Daehan Technical High School.

346
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,294
Worked at Dragon Motors,
Assembly Team One.

347
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,879
The company laid you off ten years ago.

348
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,964
Opened a chicken shop,
and then a small snack bar.

349
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,467
Both of them failed,
you're working as a chauffeur right now.

350
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,386
You've been divorced
for about three years,

351
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,221
and your daughter is ten years old.

352
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,474
A hundred and sixty million won owed
just to loan sharks,

353
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,227
and you owe 250 more to the bank.

354
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,273
Who are you?

355
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,985
What business of yours is all that?

356
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,118
We don't have many spots left.

357
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,081
Just think about it.

358
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,030
All right, then.

359
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,496
You drink at all tonight?

360
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,415
No.

361
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,751
I haven't had a drop,
but I feel tipsy still, anyway.

362
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,715
Because look what I got.

363
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,260
Gi-hun, what did you do now?
You gambled again?

364
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,345
Don't you look at me like that. I didn't.

365
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,848
I earned it all this time. It's all legit.

366
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,558
What's with your face,
by the way?

367
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,685
-What'd they try to beat you up for now?
-Hey.

368
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,603
Forget it.

369
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,605
Sang-woo been around here?

370
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,106
How's he doing at work?

371
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,608
Always keeping busy.

372
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,194
Right now, he's on a business trip abroad.

373
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,571
Ah, ungrateful prick.

374
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,282
Tell him to give me a call
when he gets back in town.

375
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,909
After all I did?

376
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,369
He got into Seoul National University,
thanks to me.

377
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,747
I used to take him to school
when we were young.

378
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,375
That's why he went to school,
got a good job.

379
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,211
He at least ought to buy me a drink.

380
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,506
What are you talking about now?
Here, take this home, okay?

381
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,174
Not to a bar. Go straight home.

382
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,593
Here. Keep the change.

383
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,561
Prick! That was 12,000 won.

384
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,826
Hmm.

385
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,457
Are you hungry? Huh?

386
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,709
Here.

387
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,629
Come on.

388
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,965
You have to finish it, okay?

389
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,759
I got that with the money I made
getting slapped, so enjoy it.

390
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,598
Ooh.

391
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,322
Here. Some allowance.

392
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,450
Come on. Take it.

393
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,743
Hold on.

394
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,705
Were you out gambling again?

395
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,873
Of course not.

396
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,669
Wait a minute.
What did you do to your face?

397
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,547
Answer me right now!

398
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,340
It was nothing like that!

399
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,220
Hold on. Are you saying
this money is stolen?

400
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,432
I didn't steal anything, Mom.
I earned it all.

401
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,937
I worked, okay. All day, I worked my hands
and face off to earn this money for us.

402
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,106
Oh, gosh.

403
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:59,034
So did you get fried chicken for Ga-yeong?

404
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,995
Yes, I got her dinner…

405
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,332
and my present and everything.
It was nice.

406
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,209
And did anything come up tonight?

407
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,962
Like what?

408
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:17,969
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad
are all going somewhere.

409
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,014
They're moving to the US next year.

410
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,186
And you'll see next year, huh. I'll get
an awesome present for you. Okay?

411
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,438
Ga-yeong, I swear.

412
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,107
Next year?

413
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,485
The US?

414
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,070
That's right.

415
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,074
Her stepdad's job begins soon
and needs him to go.

416
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,078
So the entire family
is going to move there.

417
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,500
I see.

418
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,546
You hear me?
How can you eat anything right now, huh?

419
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,132
You need to get your daughter
to stay here.

420
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,136
And how do I do that?

421
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,225
We're done. We settled that
when we agreed to the divorce.

422
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,941
I talked to that young man upstairs
who knows the law,

423
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:17,362
and he said that
the father has to show the child

424
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,949
will have financial support,
and when you can prove that…

425
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,327
then you can take custody. Huh?

426
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,624
If she moves to the US,
you know what will happen?

427
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,376
She'll forget how to speak Korean.

428
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,295
She won't be able to talk to you
like she can right now.

429
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,257
You're going to become a stranger to her.

430
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,553
Are you sure that you…

431
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,516
can really keep going
without seeing your little girl?

432
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,714
Ah, shh…

433
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,403
<i>Hello. Who's calling?</i>

434
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,322
Hello.

435
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,492
You gave me your business card earlier.

436
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,744
<i>Do you wish to participate in the game?</i>

437
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,956
<i>If you wish to participate,</i>
<i>please state your name and birthdate.</i>

438
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,446
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

439
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,699
Uh, yeah.

440
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,951
Password?

441
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,624
Red light, green light.
That's the password.

442
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,301
Ah…

443
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,350
I guess everyone is…

444
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,019
pretty tired. Um…

445
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,939
How long will it take to get to the…

446
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,650
game venue or whatever?

447
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,635
Mm…

448
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,973
What?

449
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,002
-Fifty… Fifty-two…
-What the…

450
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,882
-Fifty-five, fifty-six.
-Excuse me, sir.

451
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,426
-And then, there are those--
-What are you doing?

452
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,971
Stop talking to me or I lose count.

453
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,600
And so I was at 50, so the…

454
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,062
Ah, you must be trying to count
how many of us there are, is that right?

455
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,982
That's right. So could you stop
talking to me for a while?

456
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,776
And then… Huh?

457
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,695
Hold on.

458
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,905
Where was I just then?

459
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,827
Up on the board, sir. There are 456 here.

460
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,622
Oh. Look, that means
you were given the number one.

461
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,332
And I'm… Oh.

462
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,668
I'm the last.

463
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,547
I know all that too.

464
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,258
I'm just counting the numbers.

465
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:35,680
My doctor said counting is good
so I don't get dementia or anything.

466
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,516
If dementia's a concern for you,
then what are you doing here?

467
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,892
I think you'd wanna stay at home,

468
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,853
let your daughter-in-law
cook your meals for you.

469
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,438
Go sit on a coffee chair somewhere.

470
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,940
-And look at your grandkids, I think.
-You think so?

471
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,734
What about both of your parents?

472
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,404
Do they get nice food cooked
by their daughter-in-law all day long?

473
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,578
I don't have much time left now.

474
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,079
Huh?

475
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,749
The doctor said there's a…

476
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,419
a lump inside over here.
Growing every day.

477
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,005
Your… your head?

478
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,214
Brain tumor.

479
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,136
You little shit!

480
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,387
Stop them!

481
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,099
Hey!

482
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,559
Wow.

483
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,062
It really is a small world, huh!

484
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,356
Look at those eyes.
You still have that temper, huh.

485
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,067
Then again…

486
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,904
nobody broke your spirit,
you could always take a hit.

487
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,572
I took care of you,

488
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,617
I fed you, I taught you
when you had nowhere else.

489
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,410
This is what I get?

490
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,205
You took more from me
than whatever I might possibly owe.

491
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,458
If all of that's true,
how come you ran then?

492
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,628
Well, I didn't. I went independent.

493
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,172
Hmm.

494
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
"Independent"?

495
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,779
Independent, huh?
Are you some kind of activist?

496
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,322
Come on then, go wave a flag.

497
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,949
Oh, that's right.

498
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,786
You're from North Korea, huh?
Then wave theirs. Hmm?

499
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,454
Damn you!

500
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,374
Hey, you come here. Hold still.

501
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,126
Oh. That scar on your neck.

502
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,710
You're the damn pickpocket! You loser.

503
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,171
My money, give it back. Where is it?

504
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,007
You took it. I need it-- Ah!

505
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,009
What the hell?

506
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,970
Who are you?

507
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,765
-Uh…
-What do you think you're doing?

508
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,642
Me? Uh, well… Look.

509
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,020
The name's Seong Gi-hun.
I live in Ssangmun-dong.

510
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,147
Hey, Ssangmun-dong shit.

511
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,314
Yeah?

512
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,567
This little bitch and I
weren't done talking.

513
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,154
Yeah, I understand that. It's just
there's something that me and this…

514
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,572
woman should talk about urgently.

515
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,198
You bastard!

516
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,658
What scheme are you two running?

517
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,035
You're asking me?

518
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,163
What's your problem with this girl, 101?

519
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,957
Yeah, I'll bet that,
that you're a thug who preys on girls

520
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,292
that takes advantage of them.

521
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
Did you tell her to rob me like that?

522
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,920
-You little son of a bitch!
-Get away! Hey!

523
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,463
Hey, he wants to hit me.

524
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,299
This thug is trying to hit me, huh!

525
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,384
Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

526
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,136
Oh! Oh, there they are!

527
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,263
Over here.
She'll pick all our pockets, sir.

528
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,473
Him too. They'll pick, they'll pick…

529
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,668
I would like to extend
a heartfelt welcome to you all.

530
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,632
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

531
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,595
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

532
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,056
And why should we believe that?

533
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,184
Y-You took all our stuff
and put us to sleep coming here,

534
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,186
and then you brought us
to this strange warehouse.

535
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,522
Now you're saying you'll pay us
if we go and play a few games?

536
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,441
You really expect us to buy that?

537
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,735
We reluctantly took all of those measures

538
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,905
to maintain confidentiality
as we brought you here.

539
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,283
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

540
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,371
You all… you all have masks.
Why are you wearing those things?

541
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,414
We do not disclose the faces

542
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,542
and personal information of our staff
to any of the participants.

543
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,755
It's a measure we take
to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

544
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,131
Please understand.

545
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,133
Well, I don't believe you one bit.
You got that?

546
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,970
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

547
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,347
You can make as many excuses as you want

548
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,724
to make sure nobody knows
you broke the law in here.

549
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,645
If you're going to make up for that,
then we're gonna need something more.

550
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,981
Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

551
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,192
Age, 46 years.

552
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,945
Former team leader
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

553
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,780
Siphoned money off
from his clients' balances,

554
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,367
then invested it in derivatives
and futures options and failed.

555
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,869
Current loss, 650 million won.

556
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,289
107, Kim Mi-ok, 540 million in debt.

557
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,457
118, Oh Yeong-uk, 1,02 billion in debt.

558
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,294
322, Jung Min-tae, 880 million in debt.

559
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,796
119, No Sang-hun, 1,39 billion in debt.

560
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,716
369, Park Ju-un, 900 million in debt.

561
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,346
Every person standing here in this room
is living on the brink of financial ruin.

562
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,057
You all have debts that you can't pay off.

563
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:35,062
When we first went to see each of you,
not a single one of you trusted us.

564
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,149
But as you all know, we played a game,

565
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,860
and as we promised,
gave you money when you won.

566
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,321
And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

567
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:48,242
You called and volunteered to participate
in this game of your own free will.

568
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,160
So this is it.

569
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,121
I'll give you one last chance to choose.

570
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,793
Will you go back to living your old
and depressing lives

571
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,754
getting chased by your creditors?

572
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:04,216
Or will you act and seize
this last opportunity we're offering here?

573
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,015
Hey! Which games are we playing here?

574
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,600
In order to play fair,

575
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,603
we cannot disclose any information
about the games ahead of time.

576
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,271
One question.

577
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,524
If we win, just how much do we get?

578
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,537
Your prize money will be
accumulated in there after every game.

579
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,795
We will disclose the amount to everyone
after the first game is over.

580
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:46,217
If you do not wish to participate,
then please let us know at this time.

581
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,916
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

582
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,252
CLAUSE 1: A PLAYER IS NOT ALLOWED

583

584

IF THE MAJORITY AGREES

585
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,009

00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:51,532

Dude, look.

591
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,012
Wow, this place is gigantic.

<i>Please look into the camera. Smile.</i>

Ah, shit.

-Hey, move it.
-Ah, shh!

597
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,288

600
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,508
Hey, Sang-woo!

601
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,095
Oh, Sang-woo, my man!

602
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,682
What happened?
What the hell are you doing here?

603
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,518
Uh, your mother and I
were talking the other day.

604
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,812
She told you were out of the country
on a business trip.

605
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,898
What was that guy talking about, huh?

606
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,734
You can't be in debt?

607
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,320
The same Sang-woo who attends SNU, right?

608
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,529
<i>Attention, all players.</i>

609
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,740
<i>-After you enter the game hall…</i>
-We'll talk about it later.

610
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,075
<i>…please stand behind the white line</i>
<i>drawn on the field</i>

611

612
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:47,124
<i>Once again, will all players</i>
<i>please stand behind the white line</i>

<i>and await further instructions.</i>

614
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,270
This is the Front Man speaking.

615
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,814
Preparations for the first game
are complete.

616
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,858
We can begin now.

617
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,351
-Hey.
-Huh?

618
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,269
What's that? Over there.

619
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,188
Looks really freaky.

620
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,357
Damn, that thing
has a freaking huge head.

621
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,901
<i>Here is the first game.</i>

622
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,487
<i>You will be playing</i>
<i>Red Light, Green Light.</i>

623
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,411
<i>You are allowed to move forward</i>
<i>when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"</i>

624
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,663
<i>stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."</i>

625
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>If your movement is detected afterward,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated.</i>

626
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,836
Red Light, Green Light?

627
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,381
The thing we did as kids
in the playground?

628
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,300
-<i>Let me repeat the rule.</i>
-I think that's what she said.

629
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,468
Red Light, Green Light?

630
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,220
-Is this a joke?
-<i>You're allowed to move…</i>

631
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,680
-Do you think they're serious?
-<i>…when "it" shouts out, "Green Light."</i>

632
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,141
-Well then, bet on the first one there?
<i>-Stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."</i>

633
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,309
<i>If your movement is detected afterward,</i>

634
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,936
<i>-you will be eliminated.</i>
-A million won.

635
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,146
Deal?

636
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,732
Goddamn it.

637
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,649
You're on!

638
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,235
<i>Those players</i>
<i>who cross the finish line</i>

<i>without being eliminated</i>
<i>within the five-minute playtime</i>

<i>Red Light.</i>

644
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,419
Whoa.

645
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,297
<i>Player 324. Eliminated.</i>

646
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,966
Dumbass got caught.

647
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,847
That bang.

648
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,349
Did you hear that?

649
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,609
<i>Green Light.</i>

650
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,613

Hey, you got eliminated, idiot.

652
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,620
You can stop with the act.

653
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,368
<i>I will now repeat the rules.</i>

00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,873

656
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:03,380
<i>If your movement is detected afterward,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated.</i>

657
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,928
<i>I will repeat the rules again.</i>

658
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,057
<i>You can move forward</i>
<i>when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"</i>

659

660
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,981
<i>If your movement is detected afterward,</i>

661
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,943
<i>With that, let the game resume.</i>

662
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,361

Gi-hun, don't look back. Just listen.

671
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,946
You can't stay there much longer.

672
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,573
I think that doll senses
when you move around.

673
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,285
You won't get caught
if you're behind somebody else.

The bitch who crossed you.

685

You little shithead.

686
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,305
Want me to cross you one last time?

687

Quit trembling, you jerk.
