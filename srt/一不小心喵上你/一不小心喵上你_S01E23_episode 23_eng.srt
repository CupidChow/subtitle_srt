1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:09,930

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,080

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,330
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,030
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,390
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,600

18
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,360

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
What is it?

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
I have finished reading the documents.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,940
Stay with me for a while.

23
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,200
No, I can't.

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
You finished your work,

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,500
but I didn't.

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,260
Wasn't my heart shape sincere enough?

27
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,080
I can also blow a kiss.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,800
President Ji, please hold back please hold back

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,240
Don't disturb me.

30
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,140
I just want you to stay with me.

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,960
You are the overbearing CEO.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,640
You can't be so clingy.

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,380
Haven't you seen those dramas?

34
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,360
The overbearing CEOs are always clingy.

35
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,220
President Ji, we're at the company.

36
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,160
It's inappropriate to drink from a female subordinate's cup.

37
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,540
This cup belongs to my girlfriend.

38
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,200
Did you forget our deal?

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,060
It's not working time now.

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,540
I'm not off duty yet.

41
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,060
You're not working either.

42
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,200
You're unreasonable.

43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,300
When will you get off work?

44
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,840
I wonder if you can have dinner with me.

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I can't.

46
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,040
Then I'll work overtime with you.

47
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay.

48
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,880
Zhou Tian and President Ji will work overtime tonight.

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,120
All of you should get off work at 6 pm.

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,040
I have many works unfinished. I have to stay.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
- Me too. 
 - So do I.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,200
- Yes, me too. 
 - Me too.

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,540
Then go home to finish your work!

54
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,460
You can't bother President Ji! Right?

55
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,440
I can't. I have to use the Intranet.

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,340
You can't work overtime at the company tonight.

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,960
You'll regret it if you do.

58
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,500

59
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,940
Where are they?

60
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,100
Why did they leave so early?

61
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
It's only 6 pm.

62
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,320
Have you finished your work?

63
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,500
Not yet.

64
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,200
It's so weird.

65
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Why did everyone get off work on time?

66
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,200
A good employee should finish her work during her working hours.

67
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,420
Mr. Ji, are you telling me that I'm not efficient enough?

68
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes.

69
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,620
You have bothered my date with my girlfriend.

70
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,600
I can call it a date if you work overtime with me.

71
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,540
I booked a decent restaurant.

72
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,840
We can go there after you finish your work.

73
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,100
Don't bother. We can order a takeaway.

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,720
What do you want to eat?

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,100
You.

76
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,220
Oh, right. I suddenly remembered that I had left my mug
in the meeting room.

77
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,720
I'll get it.

78
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,280
No rush. It won't get lost.

79
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm thirsty.

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,300
I hope I can get off work earlier.

81
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,360
If you get thirsty, you can use my mug.

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,340
What are you doing?

83
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,340
Working. We need the Intranet.

84
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,820
So...

85
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,140
I didn't see anything. What happened just now?

86
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,200
I don't remember a thing.

87
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Maybe a comet hit the earth.

88
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,200
Why am I here?

89
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,420
Who am I? Where am I? What was I doing?

90
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,600
Why don't I remember a thing?

91
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,740
I have works to do.

92
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,900
Maybe we should have dinner or something.

93
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,680
I should have got off work earlier

94
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,560
so that the other colleagues wouldn't be so embarrassed.

95
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,240
Indeed.

96
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,520
You should have taken my advice.

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
It's all right.

98
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,400
We can go ahead and have a midnight snack together.

99
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,360
No.

100
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,900
How can you still be happy?

101
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,740
I should have kicked you out with a red card.

102
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,080
Please don't.

103
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,040
I was worried about you.

104
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,460
You need to take a rest while working.

105
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,420
You can't rush everything.

106
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,540
But I also have a dream.

107
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,480
It's said on the Internet

108
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,280
that you have to work hard before you get old.

109
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,380
You want to join the Sports Department?

110
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,920
I have seen your performance.

111
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,800
You did a good job.

112
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,000
After this quarter ends at the end of this month, you can join the Sports Department.

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,740
This quarter?

114
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,500
So soon.

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,080
I...

116
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,300
What's wrong?

117
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,460
Do you have any worries?

118
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,380
I can help.

119
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,760
Actually, I don't have any.

120
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,900
It's just... I came here for the Sports Department,

121
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,080
but I have learned a lot in the Performing Arts Department.

122
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,760
I also made many friends.

123
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,280
So, I'm a bit unwilling to leave.

124
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,460
Actually, it's hard to integrate the resources if the talent managers are divided by professions.

125
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,420
So, I'm thinking about whether to combine all the brokerage departments.

126
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,960
Combine?

127
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,540
So I can sign an athlete while being in the Performing Arts Department?

128
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,700
No.

129
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,040
The Sports Department will combine with the Performance Department.

130
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,820
Every talent manager is free to sign anyone.

131
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,840
You can achieve your goal of joining the Sports Department,

132
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,080
and you don't need to say goodbye to your friends.

133
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,680
What do you think?

134
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,320
You're so considerate.

135
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,300
I thought I could give you a bunch of red cards.

136
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,060
Since you're so grateful,

137
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,500
how about staying the night with me?

138
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,600
Sure!

139
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,880
Well, let's go home then.

140
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,260
Your place or mine?

141
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,860
Our own places, of course!

142
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,300
Whoever gets home late will pay for dinner next time!

143
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,200

144
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,620

145
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,040
♫  Whatever matters to me will make you feel the same  ♫

146
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,760

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,460
♫  And stand at the center of the stage bravely  ♫

168
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,320
♫  If we become unlucky  ♫

169
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,080
Goodbye, Brother Zhang Hao.

170
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,120
♫  Don't forget to keep fighting against the world  ♫

171
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,500
Zhou Tian. I heard you won't go to the Sports Department.

172
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
I wanted to go,

173
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,920
but President Ji has decided to put all the agents into one big department.

174
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,340
So, the Sports Department and the other departments will work together.

175
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,820
And I don't need to worry about working and seating elsewhere.

176
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,680
What? This is such big news! When will it start?

177
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,180
I don't know yet, but I assume it will start soon.

178
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,720
He indeed treats you as his family by telling you such a big secret.

179
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,420
No wonder you are worried about working in another department.

180
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,840
It turns out you're afraid that you can't see President Ji anytime.

181
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Don't say such nonsense.

182
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,480
Why... Why do I have to see him?

183
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,300
We're at the office. Please don't flirt with him.

184
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,380
All right. I get it.

185
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,060
Go to work.

186
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,740
President Ji, I want to reconsider about what you'd said.

187
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,240
It's a rare opportunity.

188
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,220
If you miss this chance to study,

189
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,840
you might not get another.

190
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,580
I know it's hard to get a chance to study with a professional,

191
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,160
but I can't decide right now.

192
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,400
Hurry up, then.

193
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,060
I need to give a reply.

194
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,460
Okay.

195
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,160
What are you looking at?

196
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,400
Gigi's farewell video.

197
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,780
Farewell video?

198
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,980
She left without saying goodbye.

199
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,240
She posted a video online without talking to us in advance.

200
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,940
She said she would return to her university abroad.

201
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,880
 Hello, everyone.

202
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,360
 I'll soon go abroad and continue my study.

203
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,500
 So, I made this video to say goodbye.

204
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,040
 I'm very grateful for your company during this period.

205
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,440
 This time, I came back for a man.

206
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,140
 But unfortunately, we didn't get together.

207
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,170
 However, I think, these days at the Kitties' Fairyland

208
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,740
 and

209
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,280
 singing together with Qiao Yi

210
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,740
 have become a unique memory of my life.

211
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
 All right.

212
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,980
 I'll soon go back and continue my study.

213
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,940
 So, I'll suspend this account starting from today.

214
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,220
 After I leave, I hope

215
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,520
 you can still be as happy as always.

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,180
 Okay. That's all. I'll miss you.

217
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,320
 Goodbye.

218
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,340
She actually left.

219
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,840
I'll take you to the airport tomorrow.

220
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,940
No need.

221
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,660
I traveled alone for so many times.

222
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,240
You know I don't like to say goodbye.

223
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,260
This time, you have to study hard after you go back.

224
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,140
Zhou Tian and I will visit you during your vacation.

225
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,820
I was very worried that you might want to drop out.

226
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,320
Brother, I'm not as naive as you thought.

227
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,040
There are many things that seem like twelve pink roses

228
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,220
in a blue vase.

229
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,040
They're beautiful, but you can't expect them to last.

230
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,940
I didn't expect you to speak so wisely.

231
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,140
I still have a long life to live,

232
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,980
and I'll meet many people.

233
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,700
But...

234
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,980
But every person you meet is unique.

235
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,520
Each of them went through a lot before they finally stand by your side.

236
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,300
So, you have to try your best to cherish this encounter no matter what.

237
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,240
Nian Nian,

238
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,340
you have grown up.

239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,660
I grew up long ago.

240
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,440
I have to take this.

241
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,100
Hi, Tian Tian.

242
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm having dinner with Nian Nian.

243
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,040
She'll go back to school tomorrow.

244
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,740
Okay. I'll talk to you when I get home.

245
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,440
See you then. Bye.

246
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,280
You had never been so gentle whenever you called me.

247
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,320
Jiang Jiang is right.

248
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,260
Your heart has melted.

249
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,780
Didn't you say so?

250
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,520
Everyone I meet is unique.

251
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,120
Each of them went through a lot before they finally stand by my side.

252
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,740
So... I want to cherish my relationship with Zhou Tian.

253
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,660
Eat. The food is getting cold.

254
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,360
Don't forget to wear thicker clothes after you go abroad.

255
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Okay.

256
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,040
Senior! Senior!

257
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,360
Senior, there you are.

258
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,420
Why are you here alone?

259
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,460
Gigi has left,

260
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,020
but you didn't do anything.

261
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,480
If you continue like this, she'll leave for real.

262
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,720
I saw the video.

263
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,940
You saw it? How can you be so calm after you saw it?

264
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,760
She has to finish her study, so she has to leave.

265
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,320
I'm telling you, if she actually leaves,

266
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,940
she'll never come back again.

267
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,440
She doesn't belong here.

268
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,910
She should return to her world.

269
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm so mad at you. Gigi likes you.

270
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,120
She came back because of you.

271
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,020
She worked here because she wanted to get closer to you.

272
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,340
You obviously like her. Why didn't you tell her?

273
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,890
She's young, and she has to continue her study.

274
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,660
I can't hold her back.

275
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,820
If she knows that I like her, she probably won't leave.

276
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,340
These are all excuses.

277
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,620
You'll only harm her by doing this.

278
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,760
Now, communication and transportation are developed.

279
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,920
A long-distance relationship is not difficult at all.

280
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,860
She's still young, and she will meet many other people.

281
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,960
I can't let her give up all those opportunities.

282
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Maybe, she likes me because she's impulsive.

283
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,540
Nevermind. I don't want to talk to you anymore.

284
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,040
I have said everything. You can do whatever you want.

285
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,740
I'm going home.

286
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,060

287
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,900

288
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,170
♫  I’d never thought I’d be so moved  ♫

289
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:51,340
 Brother Zhang Hao, I'll go back to school tomorrow.

290
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,860
 These days...

291
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,390
♫  There are some words that I hope you understand  ♫

292
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,480

293

♫  I want to be more than just your friend  ♫

294

296
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,340

297
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,660
♫  You light me up with your bright eyes  ♫

298
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:29,300
♫  You saved me from being lost and wandering  ♫

299
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,840
♫  May you be strong and kind forever  ♫

300
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,420
 Tian hired a new employee. This is Gigi.

301
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,080
 She came back from abroad.

302
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,200
 I'm 22 years old, and I'm a Sagittarius.

303
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
 Hi.

304
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,800
Hi, Brother Zhang Hao.

305
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 You can't always be kind to everyone.

306
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,020
 Or the people who care about you will think you don't pay enough attention to them.

307
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,340
 You! Let go of Zhang Hao!

308
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,560
 He's mine!

309
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,980
 Ten days. Let's make a ten-day deal.

310
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,660
 I guarantee to make you come back to your feet.

311
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,380
 Please! Brother Zhang Hao!

312
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,620
 Please! Do you agree?

313
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,040
 Have you fallen for me?

314
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,480
 No.

315
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,420
 Then, what if I kiss you right now?

316
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,040
 I'll stay as long as you ask me to stay.

317
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,880
♫  I just want to take you away  ♫

318
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,520
 Gigi is not the first girl who came for me, and she won't be the last.

319
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,220
 I fear that this is just a misunderstanding.

320
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,120
 Help me out.

321
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,820
 How to make a girl realize your feelings for her?

322
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,140
 You told me that the confession should be made at a place where it's special to both parties.

323
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,020
 It reminded me of this beach.

324
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,640
 I have been thinking a lot during the last ten days.

325
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,780
 I can't handle the forest.

326
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,720
 I just need one tree.

327
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,860
 Well... have you found it?

328
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,800
 Not yet.

329
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,320
 It's a good choice to join the entertainment industry.

330
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,280
 You can come back here anytime,

331
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,320
 but it'll be a pity if you miss this job.

332
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 We're not from the same world. We can't be together.

333
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,530
♫  You saved me from being lost and wandering  ♫

334
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,750
♫  May you be strong and kind forever  ♫

335
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,350
♫  May you fly to anywhere you want to  ♫

336
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:39,290
♫  You are the warm waves that guides me  ♫

337
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,820
♫  You are the wind I sail through  ♫

338
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,140

339
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,320
♫  You are the light of my heart  ♫

340
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,200
Goodbye, Brother Zhang Hao.

341
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,580
Brother Zhang Hao?

342
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,960
I didn't know your flight number, and your phone was switched off.

343
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,440
So, I have been waiting for you since early this morning.

344
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,580
Why?

345
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,960
It's been days, but you didn't say goodbye to me.

346
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,540
Why are you here now?

347
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,200
I have something to tell you.

348
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,820
I don't want to listen.

349
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,740
Gigi, I'm sorry.

350
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,600
It's all my fault.

351
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,260
I have never been in a relationship.

352
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,400
I thought I liked Zhou Tian, so when I faced your feelings,

353
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,980
I thought I might misunderstand.

354
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,280
I was afraid that I might waste them.

355
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,000
Last night, I sat in the cat cafe all night.

356
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,600
I realized I might never see you again in the future.

357
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,680
I was suddenly panicked.

358
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,820
So, I have been waiting for you since this morning.

359
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Gigi,

360
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,660
I care for you.

361
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,720
I hope you can forgive me.

362
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,940
Brother Zhang Hao.

363
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,220
I once believed

364
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,840
that I have to say it out loud when I like someone.

365
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,340
But now, I don't think the same.

366
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,800
I think... love doesn't only exist in words.

367
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,380
It's everywhere.

368
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,520
It breaks the limit of time and space,

369
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,860
and it roots in your heart

370
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,140
until it blooms.

371
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,080
The relationship I want is not an urge of passion.

372
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,160
As time goes by, it'll give everything an explanation.

373
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,720
 Passengers, may I have your attention, please.

374
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,660
 All passengers for flight CA2986,

375
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:28,200
 please proceed to counter number 17 to 25 to check in.

376
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,800
 Thank you.

377
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,500
Brother Zhang Hao, I've got to go.

378
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,400
 All passengers for flight CA2986,

379
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:45,290
 please proceed to counter number 17 to 25 to check in.

380
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,740
 Thank you.

381
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:01,220
♫  It's all right, we made a deal to wander around  ♫

382

389
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,160

390
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,700
Qiu Qiu! What happened?

391
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,360
Why did you break the vase?

392
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,580
Do you still want a snack or not? Do you?

393
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,300
- I'm talking to you! Come on. 
 - Don't be mad.

394
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,700
It's not Qiu Qiu's fault. It's mine.

395
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,800
The vase broke because I put it here.

396
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,600
Qiu Qiu, don't mind her. You'll have chicken for dinner.

397
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,560
Aren't you always fair when you're at the company?

398
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,260
Why are you like this when you come home?

399
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,080
Stop spoiling it.

400
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,500
It's still a baby.

401
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,280
We should be gentle and careful.

402
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,300
It doesn't know anything. And I'm already cleaning.

403
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,100
A baby? It's three years old now!

404
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,540
If it were a human being, it should be married now.

405
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,880
I'm telling you, you have been flirty recently.

406
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,400
Listen, I'll find you...

407
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,320
You're going to find a male cat, aren't you?

408
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,660
No way. Absolutely no. All male cats are evil.

409
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,780
Qiu Qiu is our princess. I won't allow any cat to bully it.

410
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,140
Hello, Mom. What is it?

411
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,160
 Nothing much.

412
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,770
I have just known that all your aunties

413
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,120
have cats in their homes.

414
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,360
And all the cats are male.

415
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,460
 I'm thinking, Qiu Qiu is not a kitten anymore.

416
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,360
Should we find a male cat for it as its date?

417
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,480
Date?

418
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,840
Mom, I'm afraid Ji Chen can't agree with this idea.

419
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,000
Yes. We just talked about it.

420
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,900
Her mom wants her to date someone else?

421
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,560
It's really late. I'm leaving.

422
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,100
I'll also take away the garbage made by Qiuqiu.

423
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,820
It's only 10 pm. We rarely got off work on time today.

424
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,120
You don't want me to leave? Then I'll stay.

425
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,040
Be careful. I'll see you tomorrow.

426
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,020
Okay. I'm going back.

427
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,260
By the way, I saw you were rather worried while talking with your mother.

428
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,960
Was there something wrong? You can tell me about it.

429
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,320
Well, it was not a big deal.

430
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,200
My mother came over to see a show without telling me in advance.

431
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,360
But I already talked with her solemnly.

432
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,210
That was it?

433
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,120
Then I'll drive to pick her up tomorrow. I haven't seen her for a long time.

434
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,240
No. Don't meet her.

435
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,260
I'll ask my mom to go back on her own.

436
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,740
- But... 
 - There's no "but!"

437
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,200
You can't spoil my parents.

438
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,160
Otherwise, they will get lost in your wealth and hit the bottom. Okay. Good night!

439
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,540

440
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,740

441
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740

442
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,840

443
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,100
 A date?

444
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,620
 Why did her mother ask her to date?

445
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,640
 Because I'm too slow on planning the wedding?

446
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,220
Finally.

447
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,680
The situation is very complicated.

448
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,820
Her parents liked me a lot.

449
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,880
When they saw me last time, they wanted to let Zhou Tian marry me as soon as possible.

450
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,060
But now, why did she ask her to date someone else?

451
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,860
Well,

452
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,740
let's analyze the situation back then with the words that we heard.

453
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,060
It should be like this.

454
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:32,060
 Daughter, your dad and I have heard about Xiao Chen's accident.

455
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,920
No matter how kind he is, you can't marry someone who will die anytime!

456
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,360
 No matter how kind he is, you can't marry someone who will die anytime!

457
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,220
- Mom! 
  - Don't be so mean. Ji Chen won't accept this.

458
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,600
I don't care!

459
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,840
 I'm telling you, I came here this time

460
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,820
 because I have to find you a boyfriend.

461
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,180
It'll be my fault if I dump him.

462
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,040
Your fault? Even if you want to marry him,

463
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,480
you have to consider about your future kid!

464
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,900
Fine.

465
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,160
 Where's the place?

466
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,080
I'll go.

467
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,600
So, that's what happened.

468
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,680
And then, Zhou Tian went to date someone else.

469
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
Impossible!

470
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,940
It was obvious that Zhou Tian said, "I won't go".

471
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,540
She didn't want to go.

472
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,740
"I won't go?"

473
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,880
Do you think it was a mime?

474
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,020
She definitely said, "I'll go".

475
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,000
Forget about it.

476
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,680
I made a deal with Zhou Tian that we would always be honest with each other.

477
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,880
I'll ask her directly.

478
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,940

479
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,340

480
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,380
 I'll take Qiu Qiu to meet someone. Then I'll go to work.

481
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,400
 I won't be late.

482
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,160

483
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,460
She won't actually go on a date, right?

484
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:13,945
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

485
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:17,905
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

486
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:22,505
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

487
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:28,275
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

488
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:33,035
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

489
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:36,798
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

490
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:41,335
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

491
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:46,645
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

492
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:51,275
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

493
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:54,775
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

494
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:59,475
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

495
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:04,140
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

496
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:11,135
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

497
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:15,105
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

498
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:19,705
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

499
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:24,835
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

500
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:29,335
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

501
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:33,437
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

502
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:37,878
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

503
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:49,075
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

504
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:57,975
♫  Shine for you  ♫

505
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:05,945
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

506
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:09,975
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

507
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:14,583
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

508
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:19,605
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

509
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:23,842
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

510
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:28,205
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

511
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:32,835
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

512
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:43,035
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

513
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:52,035
♫  Shine for you  ♫
