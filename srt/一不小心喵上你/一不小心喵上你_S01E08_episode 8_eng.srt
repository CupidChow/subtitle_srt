1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,030
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,460
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:57,360
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,930
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,590
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,980

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,460

17
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,380
President Ji? Heating mode in this weather?

18
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,200
I feel cold.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,780
All right.

20
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,900
President Ji, are you sick?

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,400
Are you drained because of overworking?

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,700
It's all my fault.

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Turn the heat up to full blast.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,580

25
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,900
 Nothing?

26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,800
Make it warmer.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,200
President Ji, it's the warmest already.

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,260
- What happened? You look like you were in a sauna. 
 - Listen to me.

29
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,680
President Ji has been overworked recently. He's a bit weak.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,120
Remember to get everything that can warm him up. Don't make him freeze.

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
All right, got it.

32
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
- President Ji. 
- President Ji.

33
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,120
Your cake. Xiao Xia told me to bring it to you.

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,020
Thank you, President Ji.

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,820
It completely melted...

36
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,580
It has been a whole day, anyway.

37
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,660
Throw it since it melted.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,960
You...

39
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll tell Kevin to buy you a new one tomorrow.

40
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,120
It's the new policy. To celebrate every employee's birthday.

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,780
Oh, right. President Ji, I'll go pick someone up now.

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
 New policy?

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
 Why didn't I hear anything about it before?

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,140
What's going on in there?

45
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,140
Ji Chen, you are just in time.

46
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,000
I want to replace the director. I bet Li Han is unworthy of the name.

47
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,540
Go meet the director.

48
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,540
You have to if you still want to present your story.

49
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,640
What do you mean?

50
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,880
This project will be shut down if it's not Li Han?

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,060
Why?

52
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,620
Why do I have to listen to him?

53
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,540
Because this is his specializing.

54
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,530
You're right, "Silent Cry" is your original work.

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,780
But novels and films are two different kinds of art.

56
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,220
You can't teach him how to do his job

57
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,940
just because it's your original work.

58
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,760
If you had chosen to be its scriptwriter, you should have said it...

59
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,580
at the very beginning. You can't jump out now

60
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,320
and attack the director.

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,900
Nothing good will come of it.

62
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,320
It'll harm the whole project,

63
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,280
your novel, and even you.

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,940
You can't act recklessly just because you are the original author.

65
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,600
- I... 
 - I told you when we

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,640
renewed your contract.

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,000
I hope our cooperation is a long-term thing.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,420
I hope to present 80% of your work on the screen.

69
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,320
This is also your hope.

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,280
That is why I came here in person.

71
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,460
But your coming is counterproductive.

72
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,960
I know you've read several versions of the script.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,900
You're worried that he can't present the core of your novel.

74
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,420
Yet the script and the film can present two totally different things.

75
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
You should trust the professionals and give the director a chance.

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,280
Just like we trust your novel unconditionally.

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,500
It is 16:15  (4:15 p.m.)  now. You have 15 minutes to think about it.

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,340
If you agree, go meet with the director.

79
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,240
If you don't, I'll tell the producer

80
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,560
that you won't be its scriptwriter at 18:30  (6:30 p.m.).

81
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,360
Zhou Tian. Come out.

82
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,400
Speak.

83
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,060
President Ji, I was a little dumb.

84
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,960
You said the agency was to provide service, right?

85
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,260
Shouldn't we serve Qiao Yi, a top writer,

86
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,680
and make him happy?

87
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,380
Even you, the boss of the company, should also try to please him.

88
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,960
But just now, you...

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,040
Agency is indeed to serve.

90
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,380
Our service contains leading them to see their shortages

91
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,860
and to know the truth about themselves.

92
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,820
We won't just flatter them and keep them in their dreams.

93
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,880
We share a mutual stake with them.

94
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,000
Xing Yi is a brand.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,380
We won't use writers.

96
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,300
Instead, we try our best to make them go further.

97
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,880
We created Qiao Yi.

98
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,420
We can create more the likes of him.

99
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,840
Why isn't there a heating mode in here?

100
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,400
What are you doing?

101
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,220
Stay here.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Kevin told me before he left you're algid recently.

103
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,960
He told me to keep you warm.

104
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,260
President Ji, take these.

105
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,900
If it's not enough, use these heat patches.

106
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,200
Remember. Stick them to the outside of your underwear.

107
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,860
If you still feel cold, just tell me.

108
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,880
I'll try to find something more.

109
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,580
Ji Chen is really composed.

110
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,560
Hello, Brother Yi?

111
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,420
All right, got it.

112
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,400
President Ji, Brother Yi told us to go over.

113
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,480

114
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,440
What?

115
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,960
You were panicking just now, right?

116
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
Afraid that I wouldn't go out,

117
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,360
and you would be embarrassed.

118
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,420
Honestly, I knew it was just a threatening act.

119
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,060
It's a pity, you're such a bad actor.

120
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,140
I saw you through at the very start.

121
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,840
Prepare yourself mentally. I'll invite the director over.

122
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,460
Tell me. He was anxious and worried that I wouldn't compromise, right?

123
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,400
To be fair, I compromise because I feel sorry for him.

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,720
This is how soft-hearted I am.

125
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,180
Please.

126
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,380
Director Li.

127
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,640
Sorry. I was a little rude just now.

128
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,220
It's all right. I was also a little rude.

129
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,620
 What just happened?

130
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,260
 He handled the director just now?

131
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,480
I think our main divergence is about emotional expression.

132
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,340
Can we talk about the specific scenarios?

133
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,580
That's also what I think. Turns out we're on the same page.

134
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,420
Divergence in content creation is really common.

135
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,940
Not just among directors, scriptwriters, and authors.

136
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,040
It happens a lot even among directors.

137
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,900
Divergence is actually a good thing.

138
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,100
It means this novel is deep in content and can be explained in different ways.

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,500
You're right.

140
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,020
I didn't expect this scene would look great when being expressed in a silent way.

141
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,480
The author does know his story better.

142
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,580
Thank you.

143
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,980
I should have gone to you earlier.

144
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, let's call it a day.

145
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,800
All right. Let's call it a day.

146
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,180
Thank you, President Ji and Brother Yi.

147
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,920
Good job, everyone.

148
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,320
Today, Brother Yi will treat you to dinner.

149
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,000
 Thank you, Mr. Ji. Thank you, Mr. Yi

150
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,580
 I'll eat more for you.

151
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,740
 You can watch these to feast your eyes.

152
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,720
 You brat.

153
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,120
 Cheer up. We can hang out next time.

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,980
 I don't know when the next time can come.

155
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,760
 I can't even have a happy birthday.

156
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,100
Brother Yi invited the culinary team

157
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,840
of Chuan Style Restaurant here to cook us dinner

158
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,740
in order to appreciate your help.

159
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,080
Thank you for treating us.

160
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,660
 Chuan Style?

161
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,360
 Really?

162
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,720
 Is it because I sincerely prayed?

163
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,800
Director Kevin, I wanted to visit this restaurant a long time ago.

164
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,740
I made a reservation for today.

165
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,580
Thank you, Director Kevin.

166
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,720
President Ji said the director likes it, so I invited them.

167
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,660
Guess you're lucky today.

168
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,940
Director Li, this spicy boiled fish is their signature dish. Have a taste.

169
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,400
Thanks.

170
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I don't really eat spicy food.

171
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,120
Sorry, Director Li. My mistake. Sorry.

172
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
I propose a toast to you.

173
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,220
Everyone, let's toast to Director Li.

174
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,760
Cheers.

175
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,540
I thought President Ji arranged it.

176
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,180
- Director Li, this is not spicy.
- All right.

177
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,420
Here. Have some.

178
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,220

179
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,740
Hello, Dad?

180
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,280
Yes, I'm working.

181
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
It's so rough today.

182
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,300
I don't have birthday noodles or even a cake.

183
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,540
You don't know how much I miss your noodles.

184
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,540
I'll try to go home on my next birthday.

185
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,620
- Director Li, excuse me. 
- Got to go.

186
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,860
- Qiao Yi. 
 - All right. Love you.

187
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,060
- Director Li, to you. 
 - All right.

188
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,940
Zhou Tian, it's your birthday?

189
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,840
Why didn't you tell us?

190
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,660
I didn't prepare any gift for you.

191
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,380
It's all right. Just a birthday.

192
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,740
Director Li, excuse me.

193
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,980
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

194
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,520
I want to make some noodles.

195
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,880
Follow me.

196
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,420
All right.

197
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,000
- You can use this. 
 - Okay.

198
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,720
Call me if you need me.

199
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,480
 You said the noodles your dad cooked are very special.

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,860
 That's right. The noodles my dad cooked are all made by himself.

201
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,420
 There will be pork fat, scallions, fried garlic, one soft-boiled egg,

202
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,040
 and four slices of luncheon meat.

203
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,380
 Every year, he will bring it to me on the morning of my birthday.

204
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,880
Hi.

205
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,060
Would you please give this to the girl in rose red outside?

206
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,640
Don't say I made it, please.

207
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,680
All right. I'll do it.

208
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,940
- Thanks. 
 - It's all right.

209
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,320
Director Li, have this.

210
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,920
It's not spicy.

211
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,700
You can have some.

212
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,060
Hi. Your noodles. Enjoy.

213
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,620
 Just like what dad cooked!

214
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,900
 Is dad here?

215
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,580
Happy birthday.

216
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Thanks. Thanks for your noodles.

217
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,180
How do you know I've been yearning for this noodle?

218
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,780
Noodle? What noodle?

219
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,020
Whatever. Forget it. Doesn't matter.

220
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,140
This one is just something I improvised for you.

221
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,780
Why are you so moved?

222
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,600
Don't fall for me.

223
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
Thank you.

224
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,580
Brother Yi, you're so thoughtful.

225
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,320
A great material. Art originates from life.

226
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,400
Director Li, here. Brother Yi, let's toast to Director Li together.

227
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,760
Director, let me toast you again.

228
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,120
 I just got off the plane and got home.

229
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,580
 Why are you back early?

230
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,480
 It's your birthday today. I have to be back.

231
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,020
 I bet your sports team didn't want to pay for an extra day of accommodation.

232
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,880
 Gigi said you would work late today.

233
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,740
 Where are you? Send me your location.

234
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,480

235
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,100
 Pretty close. I'll drive to you right now.

236
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,200
 All right. I'll be waiting.

237
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,780
How is it? Did you finish working?

238
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,400
Xiao Lan and the others have gone to the karaoke bar.

239
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,620
Really?

240
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,920
Let me.

241
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,460
But I have to send Qiao Yi home.

242
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,820
President Ji, it's Zhou Tian's birthday today.

243
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,140
You send Qiao Yi home.

244
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,520
All right. I'll wait for him here.

245
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,740
Thanks, President Ji.

246
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,560
Thank you, President Ji.

247
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,160
All settled. Let's go.

248
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,860
- Hello, Chen Can. 
 -  Hello, President Ji.

249
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Inform your department that we have to work tonight.

250
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,560
Yes, President Ji!

251
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Exclude Zhou Tian.

252
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,460
All right.

253
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,680
By the way, my mom called me today.

254
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,700
She asked me what birthday gift I got for you.

255
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,180
She said mine was not good enough.

256
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,160
She has been very fond of me since I was a kid.

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,260
Yes.

258
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,820
My mom always wants you to be our family.

259
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,180
Hasn't she given it up?

260
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,260
She said your parents also wanted to know.

261
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,940
They don't believe us no matter what we say.

262
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,020
They think we're just too shy.

263
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,840
It seems that we need a serious talk with them.

264
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,540
Make it clear to them.

265
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,640
To stop them from setting us up.

266
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,400
If this doesn't work,

267
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,000
maybe I should recognize her as my godmother.

268
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,380
President Ji, I heard people praising you.

269
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,760
They said you were considerate to your employees.

270
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,260
You didn't inform Zhou Tian about overtime,

271
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,700
knowing it was her birthday today.

272
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,220
I take back what I said this afternoon.

273
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,480
Zhang Hao really made it back.

274
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,380
Does he really plan to propose?

275
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,940
Very likely.

276
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,260

277
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,240
President Ji, what a kind person you are.

278
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,300
Maybe Zhou Tian will come to resign tomorrow.

279
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,200
Zhang Hao is a world champion.

280
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,080
He can make at least a few million a year.

281
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,880
After she becomes Mrs. Zhang, she won't have to work for a small salary.

282
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,440
Great. I don't have to listen to her gibberish anymore.

283
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,760
Can't you shut up?

284
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,200
Senior, why aren't Lan and the others here yet?

285
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,060
They're almost here. Traffic jam.

286
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,840
 Zhou Tian, marry me.

287
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,820

288
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,740
Well, Xiao Lan has...

289
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,020
It's all right. Keep talking. Has what?

290
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,160
Xiao Lan has a boyfriend.

291
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,560
She didn't tell me anything.

292
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,200
I just heard it from my coach.

293
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,260
They just establish a relationship.

294
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,800

295
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,840
Who is it?

296
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Is it the younger boy she said?

297
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, that's him.

298
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,360
I knew it.

299
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,080
On the surface, they look like siblings.

300
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,240
Actually, they're flirting all the time.

301
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,240
Kevin, come in.

302
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,760
Get me 20 pictures of the cat climber. I need them now.

303
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,620
Cat climber?

304
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,780
I'm on my way.

305
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,180
Speaking of which,

306
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,020
they two are basically childhood sweethearts.

307
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,520
So, you think childhood sweethearts can be together?

308
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,400
Yes, I don't see a problem.

309
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,720
No matter if they are childhood sweethearts,

310
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,200
they can be together as long as they have feelings for each other.

311
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,880
Then, is it possible...

312
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,340
Senior, what did you say?

313
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,940
Nothing.

314
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Maybe you should text him back.

315
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,240
Sorry, I'm late. I had something to do.

316
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,180
What thing?

317
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,920
Well, I didn't have time to prepare a birthday gift,

318
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
so I think I can buy a cat climber for Qiu Qiu.

319
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,640
Pick one.

320
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,400
So cute.

321
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,440
Then I'll buy them all.

322
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,660
Wait. You don't have to.

323
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,040
I don't have enough room.

324
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,780
Pick one, then.

325
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,380
Wait a second. It's my friend.

326
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,900
Just a moment.

327
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,920
Oh, my. I got a confession of love.

328
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,280
President Ji, it's the analysis report of the first...

329
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,460
- Hello? 
 -  Tian Tian, we love you.  
 -  Thanks.

330
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,160
Happy birthday.

331
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,820
 - We love you.
- I love you.

332
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,500
Tian Tian. I love you too.

333
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,540
Tian Tian, love you.

334
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,760
President Ji, it's a little noisy here.

335
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,840
Nothing. Keep enjoying yourselves.

336
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm back.

337
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,100
So it's a group confession of love.

338
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,540
Kevin, why isn't my analysis report ready?

339
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,260
Here you are.

340
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,660
- Thanks. 
 - Take care.

341
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,200
Gigi, my usual.

342
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,740
Here.

343
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,980
Thanks.

344
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,720
Tian Tian. Wait.

345
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,920
Yesterday was your birthday.

346
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,360
I didn't have time to send you a gift.

347
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll give it to you today.

348
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,540
You don't have to.

349
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,020
What is this?

350
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,260
It's my number code.

351
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,180
I played code games with my brother a lot.

352
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,800
How do you decode it?

353
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,660
Every two numbers represent one letter according to the order of the alphabet.

354
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,720
Zero eight represents "H."

355
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,660
Zero one represents "A."

356
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,020
So it's "Happy."

357
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,300
Bingo.

358
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,200
Thank you.

359
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,760
Xiao Xia? Xiao Xia?

360
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,560
Xia Chunqiu!

361
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,820
- I wasn't sleeping! 
 - Wake up. It's morning now.

362
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,500
Morning...

363
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,220
You worked a whole night?

364
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,420
Why wasn't I informed?

365
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,600
President Ji told us not to inform you.

366
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,320
President Ji.

367
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
What do you want?

368
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,820
Just a question.

369
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,480
Chen Can said you asked him not to inform me of yesterday's overtime.

370
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,890
You wouldn't help even if you were here.

371
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,700
And I would waste time mentoring you.

372
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,300
You did a good job last night.

373
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,320
The expectations for Silent Cry's film adaptation has sharply increased.

374
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,060
The original novel is also better known.

375
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,860
You all will have your bonus doubled.

376
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,520
We now have to escort Qiao Yi's new book.

377
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,840
He wants to write a non-fiction book about cross-country races.

378
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,240
You all have any thoughts?

379
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,820
Zhou Tian, do you?

380
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,960
I think we can give Qiao Yi a taste of what it is like to be a real athlete.

381
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,320
Let him experience the character's life.

382
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,760
Good one.

383
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,280
You will handle this task.

384
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,540
Copy that.

385
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,520
All right. Training center, right?

386
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,700
No problem. Just leave it to me.

387
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,600
 Thank you, Senior.

388
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,000
 So, you think childhood sweethearts can be together?

389
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,220
 Yes, I don't see a problem.

390
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,700
 Then, is it possible...

391
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,860
What should I do to make her understand?

392
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,940
Brother Zhang Hao?

393
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,620
What's on your mind?

394
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,800
Gigi, perfect timing.

395
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,160
Help me analyze something.

396
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,040
How do you let a girl know you like her?

397
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,240
Who do you like?

398
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,080
No, no. Not my problem. It's about my friend.

399
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,520
He just called me and wanted me to help him with this.

400
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,660
Let her know you like her. How easy.

401
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,740
Confess your feelings directly.

402
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,780
"Confess your feelings directly?"

403
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,180
What does he need to prepare before confessing feelings?

404
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,560
My friend is really dull.

405
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,760
We have to think about everything for him.

406
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,560
He's my friend, anyway.

407
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,460
It varies from person to person.

408
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,400
Some like it dramatic.

409
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,460
Some like it to happen when their alone.

410
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,500
Some hope it to be romantic.

411
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,960
Some want it simple.

412
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,100
Some want it to happen in fresh new places.

413
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,000
And some hope it is someplace where two people share memories.

414
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,620
Gigi, you're so clever.

415
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,660
I said it. I want to experience a real athlete's life.

416
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,600
I don't want you to arrange "The Truman Show" for me.

417
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,300
Didn't you tell him?

418
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,200
Twice on the way here.

419
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,520
How about this? To ensure everything is real but not phony,

420
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,560
you have to go with me.

421
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,580
I'll go to you if I find anything phony.

422
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,660
And they'll fix it on the spot.

423
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,300
But I have a condition.

424
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,380
You must go with me.

425
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,340
Me?

426
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,700
You're my talent manager. Shouldn't you go with me?

427
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,140
I'm the President of Xing Yi.

428
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,500
And I'm the pillar of Xing Yi.

429
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,940
Xing Yi has more than one pillar.

430
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,200
They have their talent manager. They don't need you.

431
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,240
They don't make such requests to their talent manager.

432
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
Someone has to try tomato first.

433
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,320
That someone doesn't have to.

434
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,040
I'm not used to being turned down.

435
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,400
Start to get used to it.

436
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,080
 It's a good thing, but why are they arguing?

437
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,840
- Zhou Tian. 
 - Here.

438
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,520
I have a meeting. I'll leave him to you.

439
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,180

440
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:27,020

441
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Mid-April to early May.

442
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,880
That should be just the right time.

443
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm not going unless he goes with me.

444
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,760
Brother Yi, I think it's a good thing if he doesn't go there with you.

445
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,340
Think about it. He's our CEO.

446
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,920
If he's here, others may be restrained. It'll be phony in that case.

447
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,820
You won't really experience the training.

448
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,760
But if he doesn't go...

449
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,100
I've talked to my friend.

450
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,740
He's an awesome trainer.

451
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,140
He can design a plan according to your physical fitness.

452
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,340
Nothing fake, all real.

453
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,320
I promise you'll experience an athlete's life.

454
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,100
You are out of sight, girl.

455
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,320
Quite considerate.

456
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,440
All right. He doesn't have to go.

457
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
He can't go!

458
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,240
- Ji Chen, I've decided. You don't need to come with me. 
 - Okay.

459
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,900
I will be a little more comfortable then.

460
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,700
Hello, Senior?

461
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Hello, Junior. I've got the training center you asked for.

462
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,780
It's the one we used to visit every year.

463
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,640
- You mean the one on the coast? 
  - Yes.

464
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,902
That one is really nice.

465
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:07,502
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

466
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:11,422
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

467

472

00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:48,302

00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:21,762
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

492
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:26,388
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

493
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:35,692
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

494
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:45,592
♫  Shine for you  ♫
