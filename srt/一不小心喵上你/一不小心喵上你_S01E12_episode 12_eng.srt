19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,580
All the bungee jumping spots nearby are fully booked.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,240
What can I do?

21
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,200
What's with the noise?

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,380
We're closed.

23
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,940
Come on, Brother Hao.

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,620
Sit here.

25
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,400
So, you are Zhang Hao,

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,840
that sports star?

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,460
I can feel his muscle. Indeed an athlete.

28
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,520
What's going on here?

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,260
Why are you here?

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,620
Aren't you the one who texted us to come over?

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,260
That's right.

32
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,740
Ladies, please.

33
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,800
Brother Hao is a shy guy.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,580
How about this? I'll be the host.

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,860
Let's go to that bar on Xuexin Road.

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,080
That's my stage.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
- Let's go. 
 - Okay, let's do it. 
 - Let's go.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,240
Ji Nian, I thought you were off work.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Off work?

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,440
If I really were, you would have sold Zhang Hao.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
We're closed.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Please pay the bill and leave.

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,260
What is this?

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,080
- Zhang Hao invited us here. 
 - Exactly.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,060
Who are you?

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,860
Me? I'm...

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,340
I'm his wife. Any problem?

48
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,140
What?

49
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,300
That's gross. You are married! How could you hit on us?

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,900
- Let's go, girls. 
 - Right! He's so disgusting.

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
- No, please... 
 - Where are you going?

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,080
Ji Nian. I didn't do anything wrong.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,500
Aren't you the one who said

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,560
that we should do something to help Brother Hao move on?

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,480
I meant something like bungee jumping, not introducing girls to him.

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,820
All right, okay.

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,460
Don't blame him, Gigi.

58
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,880
I know you both mean well.

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,900
But I will be fine in a few days.

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,120
You don't have to do this.

61
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,020
Brother Zhang Hao,

62
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,860
I know you have a hard time after being back from the seaside.

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,380
You can pass my bungee jumping offer,

64
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,420
but you still need to get it out of your system.

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,920
You don't have to bear it alone.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,480
Actually, I...

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,420
Excuse me?

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,720
Are you open for business?

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,340
Sorry. We're closed.

70
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,100
Brother Hao, I think Gigi does have a point.

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,560
We should go out together.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,420
We can go somewhere men are supposed to go.

73
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,800
After, you will realize.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
Zhou Tian is just one tree in the forest,

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
no matter how great she is.

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Out there, it's a forest full of trees waiting for you.

77
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,800
Really?

78
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,560
What a day!

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm so exhausted.

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm glad tomorrow is Saturday.

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,360
Xiao Xia, about the get-together tomorrow,

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,040
let's go to the barbecue restaurant nearby the company.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,900
Please inform other people about it.

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,140
I'm so tired.

85
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,320
 Are you sleeping yet?

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 How is your day?

87
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,520
 A buys day.

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,600
 I'm so tired.

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
 Tomorrow is Saturday.

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,120
 You can relax a little.

91
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,340
 I have a get-together with my colleagues this weekend.

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,840
 Get-together?

93
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,820

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,420

95
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,400

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,560
Very well.

97
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,860
 Congratulations on your promotion, Zhou Tian!

98
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,980
Thank you.

99
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,800
Sit, please.

100
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,220
I have been very busy in the last few days,

101
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,080
and I only feel better now.

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,340
Today, you can have whatever you want.

103
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,060
It's my treat.

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,920
- Great! 
 - Hold on.

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,900
Zhou Tian,

106
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,780
I'm here.

107
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,220
How can I let you pay?

108
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,460
How about this?

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,440
Let's make it my treat today,

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,380
but Li Ang will pay the bill.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,300
I'll order more food then.

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,240
What?

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,860
I lived at your place last month and paid you a great deal.

114
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,960
You should pay the bill today.

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,660
Li Ang, we are here today

116
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,700
to celebrate the promotion of Zhou Tian.

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,440
I was checking documents sent by the composer.

118
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Give me that.

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,760

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,940
Well, you need to pay now. My phone can't work now.

121
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,760
You...

122
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,620
Stop it, please. You two can fight at home.

123
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,400
It's just a meal.

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,560
No matter how cheap President Ji is to me,

125
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,880
I can still afford this meal.

126
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,380
What's wrong?

127
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,200
You all look scared.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,320
If I didn't know any better, I would have thought President Ji was here.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,780
Don't worry.

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,480
President Ji cherishes his life a lot.

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,420
He would never have barbecues here.

132
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,360
He would say

133
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,520
barbecue is carcinogenic and unhealthy.

134
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,780
P-President Ji!

135
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,720
Why are you here?

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,780
Because I, who cherish my life, love barbecue most.

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,020
This is a promotion celebration.

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm also a colleague of yours.

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,360
How did President Ji find out about the time and place?

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,820
He must have a spy inside us.

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,220
It's a get-together among colleagues.

142
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,660
We should have invited our boss.

143
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,600
Right, Kevin?

144
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,900
That's right. We all made gradual progress under President Ji's leadership.

145
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,580
President Ji should get to celebrate our promotion and pay rise with us.

146
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,280
Please sit at the host seat, President Ji.

147
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,960
We are not at the company. Any seat is fine for me.

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,780
Take my seat, President Ji.

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,220
You want my seat, President Ji?

150
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,060
- Here, President Ji.   - Come here, please.

151
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,220
How did he know about this?

152
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Please sit, everyone.

153
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,400
 Why do you have to sit beside me?

154
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,100
President Ji, I didn't expect to see you here.

155
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,360
I know you don't usually join us.

156
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,460
I probably should join you more.

157
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,010
President Ji. I have to say, you do look superior in the company.

158
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,160
If you want to be one of us,

159
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,840
perhaps you should do something today to show your sincerity.

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,060
What do you have in mind?

161
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,860
How about we play a game?

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,920
All right. Let's play a game.

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,820
 - I like games.
- Good thinking.

164
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,340
 - Game is the best.
- Great idea.

165
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,640
We are going to roll the dice?

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
It's simple.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,780
We will all be numbered.

168
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,640
For example, Li Ang will be No.0. I'll be No.1.

169
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,540
And you are No.2, 3, 4, etc. Then, we roll the dice.

170
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,280
If we get your number, you'll have to kiss whoever rolls the dice.

171
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,680
Those who can't go through it will have to drink.

172
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm okay with that.

173
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,340
- Let's do this. 
  - Yes! Come on!

174
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,220
Wait a minute. Wait.

175
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,900
There are two dice here.

176
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,160
It's impossible to have No.0 or 1.

177
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,420
Qiao Yi, you are not fooling anybody here.

178
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,680
Fine. How about this?

179
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,360
He will be No.2. I'll be No.3. And you are No.4, 5, 6, etc.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,300
You can either drink or kiss somebody.

181
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,900
President Ji.

182
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,260
Let's start with you.

183
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,300
- Me? 
 - Yes.

184
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,160
I thought you wanted to be one of us.

185
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,780
We should start with you.

186
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,800
President Ji. Are you scared?

187
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,560
Why am I scared?

188
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm here today to have fun with you guys.

189
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,960
I'll start.

190
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,300
 Five, please.

191
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,800
 Please be five.

192
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,020
Six.

193
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,280
- Xiao Xia? 
  - Here. I choose to kiss President Ji.

194
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,100
Hey, don't you know that President Ji can't drink? He's keeping a diet.

195
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,450
I can beat you all in drinking.

196
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,570
I'll have this drink for you, President Ji.

197
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,540
In fact, I'll help you drink all the beer here.

198
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,400
 Let it be five.

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,300
Qiao Yi.

200
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,180
It's five.

201
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,220
Zhou Tian is No.5.

202
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,320
Zhou Tian.

203
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,060
Zhou Tian, it's your turn.

204
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,540
Zhou Tian!

205
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,760
Go kiss President Ji.

206
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,000
What are you waiting for?

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,980
Come on.

208
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Drink or kiss. Make your pick.

209
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,500
We are all waiting.

210
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,020
President Ji has already had a lot of drinks.

211
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,820
Are you thinking of kissing President Ji?

212
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,700
Let me drink this for him.

213
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,900
No, I'll drink.

214
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,720
- President Ji, please let me. 
  - So you want to kiss me?

215
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,880
Boring.

216
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,320
Your turn, Zhou Tian.

217
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,820
My turn?

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,520
See?

219
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,980
This is what I'm talking about.

220
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,400
It's your fate.

221
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,940
You can't avoid it.

222
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,480
What are the odds?

223
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,040
Now, we are out of beer.

224
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,480
There is only one option left.

225
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,380
You have to kiss her.

226
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:44,900
 - Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

227
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,600
 Kiss.

228
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,220
We're going to go. Bye. Bye.

229
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,620
Bye, see you!

230
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,860
It's really late. Zhou Tian, I'll send him back.

231
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,400
- You take care of President Ji.  
 - All right.

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,080
Qiao Yi, let's go. You should leave too.

233
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,260
I haven't had enough beer.

234
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,420
You can't leave him to me.

235
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,460
President Ji...

236
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,240
I have no idea where President Ji lives.

237
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340

238
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
What?

239
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,080
President Ji lives across from my neighborhood.

240
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,220
Easy.

241
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,540
Watch it.

242
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,660
Sir, we'll go to the Aegean Sea Villa District.

243
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,960
Sir, to the Aegean Sea Villa District.

244
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,360
Zhou Tian.

245
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,020
I...

246
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,840
want...

247
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,100
to kiss...

248
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,000
Careful.

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,580
All right.

250
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,100
This is President Ji's house.

251
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,640
So huge and splendid.

252
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,400
Zhou Tian.

253
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,500
Thank you for taking me home.

254
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,740
I... would like to grant you a wish

255
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,000
to show my appreciation to you.

256
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,980
You are drunk. Your words don't count.

257
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,260
No, I'm not drunk.

258
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,480
It's a promise...

259
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,180
Promise.

260
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,540
I, Ji Chen, the CEO, hereby approve Zhou Tian of being transferred to the Sports Division Department,

261
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,460
and serving as a sports talent manager.

262
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,200
I'll have President Ji sign this.

263
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,740
President Ji,

264
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,560
here is the Certificate of Job Transfer.

265
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,280
Please sign.

266
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
Here.

267
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
Sign your name here.

268
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
No need to sign.

269
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,260
I'll put my thumbprint on it.

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,700
You are so smart, President Ji.

271
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,300
I have already prepared an inkpad
for you.

272
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,100

273
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,960
This can't be right.

274
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,200
This can't be right?

275
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
Then, I'll try again.

276
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,020

277
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,380
President Ji. I'm coming, President Ji.

278
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:01,020
Finally, I managed to take him back to his bedroom.

279
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,660
It's harder to handle him than a child.

280
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,660
Don't leave, Zhou Tian.

281
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,740
This will sober you up.

282
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,540
Sleep well.

283
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,100
My Zhou Tian is so nice.

284
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Sunday.

285
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,020
1003?

286
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,040
Why are you acting weird?

287
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,960
Sunday.

288
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,820
I... like you.

289
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,420
This...

290
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,780
What?

291
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,060
 He likes me as well?

292
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,300
 Did he just confess his love to me?

293
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
 Why did I use "as well"?

294
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,240
No. It can't be.

295
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,740
No.

296
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,360
Lip stick?

297
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,520
Did Zhou Tian kiss me yesterday?

298
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,900

299
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780

300
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,220

301
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,340
 Why did he suddenly confess love to me?

302
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,720
 It's so disturbing that I dare not reply to him.

303
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,780

304
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,900
Your cat.

305
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,560
Well, my internet was cut off last night.

306
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,040
I meant to say, I like your cat.

307
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,080
But the last two words failed to get through.

308
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,640
I... I only realized it today. So, I resent the message.

309
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
I see.

310
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,160
That's a relief.

311
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,800
I thought you were confessing to me.

312
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,280
Would you accept my love if it was a confession?

313
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,460
Well...

314
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,660
- I actually...
- I won't.

315
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,300
It's a serious matter.

316
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,280
No man should confess his love to a girl on WeChat.

317
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,020
Such man is very likely to be a male chauvinist.

318
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,880
He can't expect that girl to say yes.

319
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,500
It's ridiculous.

320
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,280
But, I'm glad you are not such a man.

321
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,720
No, I'm not.

322
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,400
I was just asking.

323
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,800
By the way, why did you say you like my cat?

324
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,920
Did Qiu Qiu do anything?

325
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,140
Qiu Qiu came over again. And she was covered with mud.

326
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,540
I wanted to take her to have a bath before I go to work.

327
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,960
But I have to meet a client this afternoon.

328
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm afraid I can't pick her up later.

329
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,240
That's not a problem.

330
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,120
You can leave her at the pet store.

331
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,260
When I pass the pet store later, I'll pick her up and drop her off at Hao's shop.

332
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,560
All right. it's settled then.

333
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,630
In this case,

334
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,100
if I wait at the pet store in advance,

335
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,420
I could finally have the chance to see him?

336
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,800
Good idea.

337
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,040
 Kevin?

338
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,360
 Kevin is 1003?

339
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,200
Please take care of it. Someone else will pick it up later.

340
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,740
Bye.

341
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Kevin is 1003?

342
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,480
And I thought he was confessing to me yesterday!

343
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,860
How could it be? Could things be any worse?

344
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,180

345
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,740
That's the development strategy for all departments.

346
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,580
Don't forget to send me your quarterly plan after the meeting.

347
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,960
You are dismissed.

348
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,480
Come here, Zhou Tian.

349
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,640
President Ji. What's wrong?

350
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,440
I was wondering

351
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,160
what happened after you sent me back last night.

352
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,260
What?

353
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,180
I didn't do anything last night.

354
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,500
Look at those two...

355
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,440
President Ji, can we not talk about personal things here?

356
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,720
If someone eavesdrops on us,

357
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,580
he might think we're in a secret relationship.

358
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,320
So,

359
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,640
you want our relationship to be public?

360
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,820
That's not what I'm saying.

361
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,700
Anyway, you were drunk last night,

362
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,580
and I took you back to your place and left.

363
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,040
No.

364
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,360
There is another thing.

365
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,020
 Why does he have to bring that up?

366
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,220
 Even if he isn't embarrassed, I am.

367
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
 No.

368
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,500
 Perhaps,

369
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,640
 he was too drunk to remember what happened last night.

370
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,060
 He wants to know it from me?

371
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,620
I wasn't going to say anything.

372
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,980
But since you want to get to the bottom of this,

373
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,800
I'll have to tell you the truth.

374
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm just curious

375
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,180
if you will acknowledge your deed.

376
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,660
Sure.

377
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,600
You promised to transfer me to the Sports Division.

378
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
When did I say that? Can you prove it?

379
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,260
Of course, I can prove it.

380
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,380
Check this out.

381
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,960
This is the proof.

382
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,100
You planted this lip print.

383
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,820
President Ji, are you going to deny it?

384
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,020
 Last night, I actually kissed this

385
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,800
 instead of Zhou Tian?

386
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,960
Apart from the fact that this isn't a normative certificate,

387
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,420
this handwriting isn't mine.

388
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,280
I wrote this.

389
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,680
But this lip print was put on by you yourself.

390
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,400
Look at the shape and the lip lines.

391
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,620
It's yours, for sure.

392
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,900
Is my mouth really that big?

393
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,280
If you don't believe it,

394
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,780
you can make another lip print.

395
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,200
Then we'll compare it.

396
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,940
But there is no inkpad in the conference room.

397
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,480
Luckily, President Ji, I have lipstick.

398
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,200
Come on.

399
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,450
President Ji. We got a phone call from Tiansha Real Estate.

400
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,240
They want to...

401
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,120
I'm sorry, President Ji. I didn't see anything.

402
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,500
Please continue. Enjoy.

403
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,900
Hold on!

404
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,020
Zhou Tian, I told you this lipstick smells bad.

405
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,820
Why did you have to fix your make-up in the conference room?

406
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,020
This isn't a dressing room.

407
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,560
P-Put it away.

408
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,100
All right, President Ji.

409
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,660
I have work to do. Bye, President Ji.

410
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,860
That was weird.

411
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,440
President Ji, you were...

412
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,160
Shut up.

413
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,020
Kevin!

414
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,280
But you said that guy was so manly and gentle.

415
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
Kevin is a little effeminate.

416
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,500
He confessed his love to me on WeChat yesterday.

417
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,580
He did make an excuse this morning,

418
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,320
but I'm sure he meant what he said.

419
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,460
Why is that guy Kevin?

420
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,660
Kevin... I thought Kevin was a celibatarian.

421
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,880
Exactly. I thought that too.

422
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,540
Clearly, he's not now.

423
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,700
Perhaps people can change their doctrine?

424
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,600
This morning, I saw Kevin and Qiu Qiu at the pet store.

425
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,000
He didn't see me though.

426
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,660
Why do I feel your guy isn't actually Kevin?

427
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,020
Director Kevin,

428
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,980
Zhou Tian wants to talk to you.

429
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,900
Ask him. Make it clear.

430
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,820
Kevin. I was wondering

431
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,840
if you have a cat.

432
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
Cat?

433
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
I hate animals that shed fur.

434
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,900
It's disgusting.

435
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,460
Why do I see cat hair on you?

436
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,840
Why do you care?

437
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,980
This cat is different.

438
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,220
To me, it's an indispensable part of my relationship with its owner.

439
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,560
It's a demonstration of appreciation and trusts its owner puts in me.

440
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,820
No one can replace my role in the owner's life.

441
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,660
I don't have to tell you this.

442
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,100
It's clear now. He is that guy.

443
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,960
Did you hear that?

444
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,500
He said my cat is an indispensable part in a relationship.

445
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,300
But he's such a pervert!

446
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
I can't believe it!

447
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,000
I have got to delete 1003 on WeChat.

448
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
No, you can't.

449
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,060
Kevin seems to value this relationship a lot.

450
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,440
If you delete his contact,

451
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,620
he may do something extreme to you.

452
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,060
You think?

453
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,560
Well, I can block him from seeing my Moments.

454
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
Yes, you can do that.

455
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400

456
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,900
 One is a pervert.

457
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,580
 One likes to abuse his subordinates.

458
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,360
 I can't believe both of them are in my life.

459
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,520
 I must have been an evil last life to deserve them now.

460
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,820

461
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,900

462
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:10,010

463
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,960
 Are you busy?

464
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,900
 I want to tell you something.

465
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,740
 There are things I need to explain.

466
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,660

467
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,500
Hello, Kevin. Check what's going on in the Performing Arts Department and make some arrangements.

468
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,320
Make sure Zhou Tian is free.

469
