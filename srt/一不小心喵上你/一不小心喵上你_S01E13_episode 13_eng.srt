1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,130
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,130
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,430
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,930
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,300
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,720

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,020

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,420
 I have something to explain.

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,380

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,420

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,920
Hello, Kevin.

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,210
Adjust the work of the Performing Arts Department.

23
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,950
Make Zhou Tian available.

24
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,220

25
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,150
You liar.

26
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,140
Hello, Kevin.

27
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,240
Arrange things about Tiansha Real Estate today.

28
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,800
The fiction competition that Qiao Yi will attend is looking for commercial sponsorship.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,850
Mr. Chen of the board of directors introduced a client from Tiansha Real Estate.

30
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,210
We have a date tonight. We'll start at 5 pm.

31
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,120
As Qiao Yi's executive talent manager, Mr. Ji wants you to cooperate with me

32
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,000
in researching the other party's business status and information.

33
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,350
 I declined you on WeChat, so you're finding excuses to work together with me?

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,890
I believe I can handle the information trifles myself.

35
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,110
As the assistant of the president,

36
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,790
you must have more important jobs to do.

37
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,720
Since when did you become this nice to me?

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,470
What ulterior motives do you have?

39
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,470
 That's my question.

40
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,740
I, of course, have no ulterior motive.

41
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,470
I'm just trying to work independently to prepare myself.

42
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,420
Since you want to prepare yourself so badly,

43
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,480
I'll make you fully in charge of this matter.

44
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,430
Kevin, I need you to go to the branch office to do something for me.

45
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,270
I'll attend the dinner party with Zhou Tian.

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,250
But President Ji, meeting clients is always my...

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,380
Don't come back if you don't arrive at the branch office before 5 pm.

48
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,380
All right, I see, President Ji.

49
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,180
I'm on my way.

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,040
Get ready. Let's start at 5 pm.

51
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,380
My dear Tian.

52
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,820
I heard it all.

53
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,720
Since you moved to this cubicle,

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,980
President Ji has valued you more and more.

55
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,800
He's now taking you to meet a major client.

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Tell me. Did you use any magic on him?

57
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,650
If I really could use magic,

58
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,440
I would make him forget me.

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,310
Meeting clients sounds so knotty.

60
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,820
Maybe I'll have to drink.

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,020
You're right.

62
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,020
Our real estate clients are all knotty.

63
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,410
I think it'll be a tough war to handle them.

64
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,290
I see. That's why he chose you over Kevin.

65
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,200
You're the gift.

66
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,980
Don't scare me.

67
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,220
I know President Ji is mean,

68
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,970
double-minded, and a yandere. 
  (T/N: someone who become possessive of love interest)

69
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,670
But I don't think

70
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,890
he will sell out his female subordinates for the sake of his purpose, right?

71
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,770
- Won't he? 
 - He will?

72
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,130
Just joking.

73
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,160
Maybe he won't. Don't take my joke seriously.

74
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,820
Just go with President Ji.

75
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,110
I believe you will come back safe and sound.

76
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,640
Why do I feel that is a curse?

77
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,870
Xin Xin, I have to go out.

78
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,540
Tian Tian will go meet a client with her boss.

79
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,330
She doesn't have time to pick up Qiu Qiu.

80
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,510
So I need to help her. Look after the shop.

81
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,060
Rest assured.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,510
I think Brother Hao looks much better today.

83
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,760
He should be fine.

84
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,130
Guess what I said is working now.

85
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,070
All right. I'll get going.

86
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,610
Bye.

87
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,260
It's not what you said worked.

88
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,610
It's all my work.

89
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,910

90
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,850
Brother Zhang Hao. I'll be back later.

91
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,300
All right.

92
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,070
Brother Hao, let's close up early today.

93
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,810
I'll take you somewhere nice tonight.

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,640
Please.

95
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,680
Mr. Ji, you're finally here.

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,770
Let me introduce, President Wu from Tiansha Real Estate.

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,780
President Wu, this is the CEO of Xing Yi,

98
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,730
Ji Chen, President Ji.

99
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,850
Nice to meet you, President Ji.

100
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,120
You too, President Wu.

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,620
This one is Qiao Yi's executive talent manager, Zhou Tian.

102
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,570
President Ji, this is the first time we have met,

103
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,450
but I can tell you're a genius.

104
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,070
And Miss Zhou,

105
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,260
you look so pretty and smart.

106
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,980
I can see you must be a good helper.

107
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,380
Thank you, President Wu.

108
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,530
Let's talk while eating. Come on. Take a seat.

109
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,980
Please.

110
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,300
So you're Zhou Tian.

111
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,650
I heard President Ji values you a lot.

112
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,400
Even Kevin is falling out of favor.

113
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,550
So promising. I have faith in you.

114
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,750
 What a corporate slave I am.

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,360
 He's totally abusing me.

116
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,870
Thank you, President Chen.

117
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,940
President Ji taught me well.

118
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,500
Come on. It's our first meeting today.

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,680
We have to clink glasses.

120
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,210
Yes, right. Come on.

121
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,740
President Ji, your health...

122
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,670
I cannot hold the liquor,

123
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,330
but President Wu is very enthusiastic.

124
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,230
I have to drink one glass at least to show my respect.

125
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,200
Cheers.

126
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,100
Nice. I like you, President Ji.

127
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,420
I'll just cut to the chase.

128
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,300
We studied the fiction competition plan.

129
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,530
Its fame and influence are what matters most to our Tiansha Real Estate.

130
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,670
I won't waste our time.

131
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,760
About the sponsorship, I don't think

132
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,450
there will be a problem.

133
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,870
President Wu is straight as I expected.

134
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,760
I hope we'll have a good time working together.

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,730
Not just a good time.

136
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,480
Tiansha Real Estate and Xing Yi,

137
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,250
this will be an alliance between giants.

138
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,450
This is a most welcome opportunity.

139
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,600
Exactly, an alliance between giants. An alliance between giants.

140
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,060

141
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,410
Sorry for this.

142
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,370
Work comes first.

143
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,850
Then I'll go answer this.

144
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,120
Please, President Ji.

145
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,350
What a pleasant cooperation.

146
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,460
After President Ji comes back, let's drink till we drop today.

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,760
Right. Come on.

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,620
Miss Zhou, let's have a toast?

149
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,290
Hello?

150
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,510
 President Ji, I have read the accounts of the branch and the shareholding structure you said.

151
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,020
 As you expected,

152
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,240
 there are also problems with the publisher of Yi's new book.

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,740
I knew it.

154
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,770
Now, send me the pictures.

155
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,740

156
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,660
- Miss Zhou, you can't drink this. 
 - Put it down.

157
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,300
- Don't you take it from me. 
 - Zhou Tian.

158
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,050
- I'll drink this for President Ji. 
 - Be careful.

159
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,330
- Don't. 
 - Don't drink this. Stop.

160
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,040
- Don't you take it from me. 
 - Zhou Tian.

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,050
Come down, Zhou Tian.

162
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,550
I have to drink this for President Ji.

163
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,810
Enough.

164
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,230
Zhou Tian, come here.

165
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,410
What...

166
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,470
President Ji, you're finally back.

167
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,030
What... What...

168
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,940
- What happened? 
 - "What happened?"

169
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,410
Miss Zhou said you couldn't drink and would drink for you.

170
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,780
She bottomed this up in one gulp.

171
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,600
And she was so strong. We couldn't even stop her.

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,460
- I didn't know what she was... 
 - Ji Chen, why did you bring her

173
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
instead of someone who behaved even when drunk? Look at her.

174
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,960
- Zhou Tian behaves when drunk. 
 - This is...

175
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,460
Come on. Let's drink more.

176
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,880
No. Don't drink more.

177
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,200
You can't drink more.

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,030
President Chen, Zhou Tian is mine.

179
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,910
She is diligent and aspiring.

180
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,720
Also, she won't abuse power for personal gain

181
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,860
and harm the interests of the company.

182
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,570
Xiao Ji, what are you implying?

183
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,820
I have long heard that President Chen has a close relationship with Tiansha Real Estate.

184
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,110
So I investigated the shareholding structure.

185
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,630
If I'm right,

186
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,760
you're also a shareholder of Tiansha.

187
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,760
You investigated me.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,180
If I didn't and just sighed the contract,

189
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm afraid Tiansha Real Estate would make an issue of Qiao Yi.

190
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,790
Neither Qiao Yi himself nor Xing Yi will accept this kind of cooperation

191
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,510
that does not consider long-term interests.

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,910
Old Chen, what's going on?

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,930
Can you handle this or not?

194
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,910
Not!

195
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,230
President Ji, we just need a sponsorship.

196
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,690
Also, President Wu will offer tens of millions of money.

197
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,220
You shouldn't see the woods for the trees.

198
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,320
President Wu, thanks for your trust.

199
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,070
Sorry for terminating our partnership.

200
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,550
- Hey. 
 - Zhou Tian, let's go.

201
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,920
Hey.

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,700
D-Don't go.

203
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,870
- Let's drink more. 
 - Wait.

204
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,950
Ji Chen, you're being stupid.

205
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,810
You don't know what you're turning down.

206
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,920
If you can't finish the goal this year,

207
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,990
I promise you'll be fired!

208
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,220
President Ji, you really took me to the hotel.

209
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,160
Just like what Xiao Xia said.

210
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,860
You're not trying to sleep with me, are you?

211
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,110
I have to call my mom and ask for her opinion.

212
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,410
I only took you here because you hit our driver.

213
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,920
You shouldn't have drunk so much if you couldn't drink.

214
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,900
Who told you I couldn't?

215
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,060
Why can't you trust me?

216
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,940
I'm telling you.

217
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,990
I knew you were using working as an excuse

218
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,410
to abuse me! Am I right?

219
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,670
You can tell me if you don't believe in my working ability.

220
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,480
You don't believe me.

221
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,060
Fine.

222
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,420
I'll drink more to make you believe it!

223
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,780
All right. I now believe you.

224
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,480
Let me help you to bed.

225
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,070
Let's go.

226
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,750
My clothes are wet.

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,540
I need to undress before going to sleep.

228
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Undress me.

229
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,710
Help me.

230
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,830
Hurry.

231
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,940
Take this off me.

232
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,520
Sleep now.

233
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,030
I'll get another room.

234
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,160
Who said you could leave?

235
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,610
Why are we closing up early today?

236
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,500

237
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560

238
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,540
What?

239
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,310
They two went to a bar?

240
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,920

241
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,580

242
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,990
Zhou Tian. Stop fussing. Get up.

243
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,720
Qiu Qiu.

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,150
Qiu Qiu. Let me tell you.

245
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,990
In that company,

246
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,690
Ji Chen, Kevin,

247
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,310
and Qiao Yi,

248
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,160
they make me run errands every day.

249
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,420
All kinds of errands.

250
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Zhou Tian, bring my shoes to me.

251
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,140
Zhou Tian, collate Qiao Yi's information and give it to me.

252
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,910
Zhou Tian, buy ten cups of coffee.

253
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,100
Four iced lattes,

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,990
four hot lattes,

255
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,770
and two hot Americano.

256
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Ji Chen.

257
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,750
Ji Chen, you're a tyrant.

258
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,410
A capitalist.

259
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,970
You want to tire me out, and then you'll be happy, right?

260
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,550
I'm a tyrant. A capitalist?

261
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,640
In your heart,

262
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,990
I'm just abusing you, using you,

263
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,710
but giving you no opportunity?

264
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,630
Giving you opportunities is exactly what I'm doing.

265
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,120
Opportunities...

266
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,720
I do want to have an opportunity...

267
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,850
I want a turnaround...

268
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,980
Zhou Tian.

269
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,980
I assign you to different projects to enrich your experience.

270
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,500
Think about Kevin.

271
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,040
- Kevin... 
 - Kevin.

272
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,620
Don't say that name in front of me.

273
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,020
Qiu Qiu, do you know?

274
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Do you know who 1003 is?

275
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,060
I know.

276
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,020
I have already known.

277
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
Really?

278
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,820
Zhou Tian,

279
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,630
I...

280
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,500
I...

281
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,660
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

282
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm...

283
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,670
your cyber cat-petting friend,

284
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,630
1003.

285
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,540
1003?

286
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,040
You devil!

287
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,480
Why did you slap me?

288
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,450
I did this for Sunday.

289
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,010
1003.

290
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,380
You're a pervert!

291
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,350
- What do you mean? 
 - You're Ji Chen's flunky!

292
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,170
You hid your identity and lied to me for so long.

293
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,690
You tricked me into telling you so many secrets.

294
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,370
Tell me!

295
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,830
Did you sell me out to Ji Chen

296
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,000
and tell him everything?

297
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,450
You and that lunatic Ji Chen.

298
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,360
You two are on the same team!

299
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,370
Flunky? Me?

300
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,530
Do you think 1003...

301
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,940
Kevin!

302
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,930
When Kevin went to give Qiuqiu a bath,

303
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,600
she must have seen him.

304
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,140
He's not 1003!

305
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,070
I don't believe you!

306
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,430
1003 and Ji Chen,

307
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,940
both of you are devils!

308
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,270
You all lied to me.

309
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,480
Forget it.

310
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,700
I won't reason with a drunk.

311
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,290
Go to sleep.

312
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,420
I'll be on the couch. Call me if you need anything.

313
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,210
Don't go!

314
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,690
Qiu Qiu, don't go. Stay with me.

315
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,730
So hot!

316
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,940
I'll get changed.

317
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,930
So hot...

318
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,920
Wait! Zhou Tian! Stop!

319
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,090
Qiu Qiu, look!

320
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,210
Do you like my dance?

321
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,810
I'm telling you, when I retired,

322
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,910
someone even asked me to work as a personal trainer in a gym.

323
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,400
You?

324
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,580
A personal trainer?

325
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,100
How is it? How is my dance?

326
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
Qiu Qiu, tell me.

327
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,650
Am I cute?

328
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,520
Yes.

329
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
Zhou Tian,

330
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,690
I...

331
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,010
I always think you're cute.

332
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,450
I think,

333
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,980
I have fallen for you.

334
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,620
You like me?

335
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,360
Then let's dance together!

336
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,310
Now. Ladies, please give a warm welcome to my boss, Zhang Hao.

337
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,640
And, he's also a trail running athlete.

338
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,100
He usually enjoys staying home and barely comes out to have some fun.

339
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,990
Today, he finally agreed to come over.

340
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,490
Let's have some fun!

341
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,580
- Yes! 
 - Welcome!

342
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,020
Oh, you shouldn't have. I have been bored recently,

343
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,340
so I wanted to come out to relax.

344
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
Enjoy yourselves and don't worry about me.

345
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,650
Oh! An athlete! We have something in common.

346
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,060
Here, try this.

347
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,270
- No, no. Thanks. 
 - He's shy.

348
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,720
This is Sister Xiu, the major shareholder of this bar.

349
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,210
She also has many gyms in her name. Right?

350
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,470
That's true!

351
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,070
Go ahead! Don't mess this up.

352
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,660
Come on. It's just a small business!

353
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,680
- Let's drink! 
 - We have a chain now!

354
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,220
You're exactly my type!

355
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,770
- Sister Xiu. You're Sisster Xiu, right? 
 - Yes!

356
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,560
- Calm down. I... 
 - It's okay.

357
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,430
I'll toast you.

358
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,840
- I'm sorry! 
 - It doesn't matter.

359
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,110
- Darling? No, darling! 
 - How dare you flirt with my wife!

360
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,450
Darling, you misunderstood!

361
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,740
- Nonsense! He's groping you! 
 - I didn't...

362
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,480
Go away! You! Come with me!

363
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,820
Buddy! Hey! We're just friends!

364
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,710
Get lost!

365
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,910
- Come with me! 
 - Wait! Darling, we're just...

366
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,830
Stay where you are!

367
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,190
You! Let Zhang Hao go!

368
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,610
He's mine!

369
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,630
How dare you!

370
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,240
Excuse me.

371
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,320
It's plastic.

372
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,560
Anyway, let him go!

373
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm telling you,

374
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,560
since I'm here, there will be blood.

375
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,360
Either it's yours,

376
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,450
or Xin Xin's.

377
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,700
Why me?

378
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,320
Wait a second. Who are you?

379
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,770
How dare you talk to me like that in this kind of place?

380
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,710
- Come on! 
 - No, darling!

381
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,890
Come at me! Don't be rude to a girl.

382
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,240
Exactly!

383
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,110
You're just a loser if you get physical with a girl.

384
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,380
If you're not, you have to follow my rules.

385
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,510
And if you win my game,

386
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,120
you can do whatever you want to Xin Xin.

387
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,330
Oh, come on! Why me again?

388
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,270
Shut up!

389
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,050
As you wish!

390
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,760
Come on!

391
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,390
- Chug it! 
 - I have never seen someone so good at drinking.

392
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,330
Chug it!

393
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,360
Keep going! Can't you defeat her?

394
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,070
He's going to lose!

395
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,810
You dared to play my drinking game?

396
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,650
So naive!

397
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,080
- Great! 
  - Wow!

398
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,110
Impressive!

399
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,720
Nine.

400
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,220
Ten.

401
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,530
Eleven.

402
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,210
Twelve.

403
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,330
Don't stop!

404
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,730
Go on!

405
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,380
Keep practicing! A personal training lesson is costly!

406
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,820
All right. Go to sleep.

407
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,600
I'm leaving.

408
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,770
Don't go!

409
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,350
You're not going anywhere.

410
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,320
Stay here.

411
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,520
Qiu Qiu,

412
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,750
do you know?

413
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,750
I grew up

414
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,450
in a sports team.

415
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,870
I used to live in the dorm,

416
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,400
eating,

417
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,310
and training together

418
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,960
with others.

419
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,040
But later,

420
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,900
I was injured,

421
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,700
so I retired

422
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,360
and left the sports team.

423
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,650
But, luckily,

424
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,220
I met you.

425
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,020
You always keep me company.

426
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,600
Right?

427
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,290
I thought...

428
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,120
I thought my bad luck had finally disappeared.

429
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,310
I have you,

430
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,700
and I can tell my little secrets to 1003.

431
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,700
Even that cold-blooded crocodile

432
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,590
has learned to care for me.

433
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,120
He protected me from the rain,

434
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,940
and he also helped me treat my wound.

435
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,520
What am I thinking?

436
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,310
I'm such a fool.

437
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,750
Now, I have you by my side.

438
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,570
The two of us can live together

439
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,940
forever, can't we?

440
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,090
Gigi, how did you find me?

441
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,750
With a bit of help from Xin Xin, of course.

442
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,000
He took you to that kind of place and even posted it on his Moments.

443
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,380
I saw his post, so I rushed over as soon as possible.

444
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,990
Otherwise, who else would come and save you?

445
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,000
Xin Xin wanted to take me out to relax, so I thought it might be a good idea.

446
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,690
I didn't expect so much trouble.

447
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,950
I guess I'm not suitable for that kind of place.

448
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,730
That's true. It's a nightclub. What else do you expect?

449
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,660
It might even harm your reputation as a world champion.

450
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,550
Come on, don't listen to Xin Xin's nonsense.

451
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,120
He probably advised you not to give up the whole world for one woman.

452
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,950
If you're interested in those various and complicated women,

453
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,120
I can act like all of them.

454
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,860
Act? How do you want to act?

455
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,850
Whatever you want!

456
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,220
Anyway, let's make a deal. Give me ten days.

457
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,890
I guarantee to make you get back on your feet.

458
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,650
Do you agree?

459
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,870
Please! Brother Zhang Hao! Please!

460
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,140
Okay! I know you're worried about me.

461
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,670
I can agree, but you can't be as unreliable as Xin Xin. Okay?

462
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,010
No problem! My tricks are way better than his.

463
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,650
Let's go!

464
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,950
Last night...

465
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,270
Was I drunk?

466
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,600
Thank goodness.

467
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,750
 Your taxi will arrive at a quarter past eight.

468
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,990
 Don't be late.

469
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,870
Nothing good comes after a hangover.

470
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,210
I can see that now!

471
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,520
Oh, no!

472
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,480
- What's wrong? 
 - You smell different.

473
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,170
Did you change your shower gel?

474
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,210
You didn't change your clothes.

475
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,620
Surprisingly,

476
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,230
President Ji didn't change his either.

477
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,410
And more surprisingly, you two went out last night.

478
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,900
Did you...

479
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,220
Don't say nonsense.

480
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,000
I was drunk last night, so I stayed in the hotel.

481
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,240
Nothing happened between us.

482
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,870
What? A hotel?

483
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,140
You two stayed in the same room and did nothing?

484
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,870
Do you think I'll believe it?

485
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,410
Oh, dear! My good friend stole my Prince Charming!

486
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,930
We were both hard workers, but now you're going to be the boss' wife!

487
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,050
You're still at work.

488
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,370
Be careful that President Ji might ask you to get your compensation from the HR Department.

489
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,740
Xiao Xia, your lips are a mess.

490
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,140
 You were busy yesterday.

491
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,790
 Are you free to talk today?

492
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,990
Okay, let's start working.

493
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,620
S-Sure!

494
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,320
President Ji, please sign this plan for the award ceremony of the fiction contest.

495
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,790
Xiao Xia, Xiao Xia!

496
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,220
Something's wrong.

497
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,160
What is it?

498
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,940
When Kevin was here, I received a message from 1003.

499
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,920
However, Kevin wasn't holding a phone.

500
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,110
Could it be that Kevin isn't 1003?

501
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,580
But, yesterday, I saw Kevin. He took Qiu Qiu to the pet store.

502
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,900
Well, it was possible that 1003 asked Kevin for help.

503
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,430
But Kevin hates cats.

504
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,650
It must be a request from someone he couldn't resist.

505
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,390
 President Ji!

506
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,900

507
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,070

508
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,020

509
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,770

510
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,970
Wait. Can this company do other designs except for ceremonies and parties?

511
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,080
I think so.

512
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,370
President Ji, you want...

513
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,940
It's my private matter, you don't need to ask.

514
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,570
Later, I'll send you the details. Get it done within this week.

515
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,110
- But... 
 - Get out.

516
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,780

517
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,330
Hey. You're free now.

518
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,200
Yes, I was busy. I'm free at the moment.

519
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,010
How are you? Are you busy?

520
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,460
For now, no.

521
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,950
A few days ago, you said we had a misunderstanding.

522
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,630
You wanted to explain. Right?

523
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,500
 - Yes. 
- Since we both have some spare time,

524
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,080
we can meet today after work and talk about it in person.

525
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:09,250

526
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,540
Don't hesitate. You didn't come last time,

527
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,520
so you can make it up to me today.

528
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,160
But I have a business dinner tonight.

529
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,770
Tomorrow, then.

530
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,970
Tomorrow...

531
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,590
You said you were not busy.

532
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,550
Yes.

533
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,880
But just for now,

534
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,480
at this moment. This minute.

535
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,570
Fine.

536
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,350
Choose a date you are available.

537
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,300

538
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:52,291
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

539
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,251
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

540
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,751
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

541
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:06,621
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

542
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:11,381
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

543
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:15,144
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

544
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:19,681
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

545
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:24,991
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

546
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:29,621
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

547
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:33,321
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

548
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:37,621
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

549
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:42,686
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

553
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:03,181
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

554
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:07,681
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

555
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:11,783
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

556
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:16,224
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

557
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:27,021
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

558
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:36,021
♫  Shine for you  ♫

559
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:44,491
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫
