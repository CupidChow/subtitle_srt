1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,230
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I'll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,690
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I'll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,600
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,780

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,620

17
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,680
Leave me alone.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
I can make it myself.

19
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,940
Do you think they are weird?

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Nope.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,680
Oh my, Zhou Tian.

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,820
What the hell is on your mind?

23
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,120
How could you think of that crocodile?

24
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,620
And your heart is pounding.

25
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,620
You've lost your mind!

26
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,060
Yet...

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,020
That crocodile doesn't seem to be so cold-blooded today.

28
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
He comes easy on the eyes

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,340
when he's not being mean.

30
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,300
Stop, stop!

31
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,540
These are all his sugar-coated bullets.

32
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,800
I cannot get caught in his snare.

33
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,060

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,340
Zhou Tian is my employee.

35
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,320
She's a girl.

36
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm her boss.

37
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm a man.

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,060
But under that circumstance,

39
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,400
even though it was not Zhou Tian, but Kevin,

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,920
I was supposed to lend him a hand.

41
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,360
It's what a gentleman should do.

42
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,940
So it's reasonable

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,180
to send her a message now, right?

44
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,460
 How are you doing today?

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,540
 Rotten luck. I sprained my ankle.

46
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,120
 That peacock and the crocodile are to blame.

47
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,460
 Still painful?

48
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,480
 I'm doing better.

49
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,560
 Crocodile's ice pack did work.

50
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,140
 However... These are his sugar-coated bullets.

51
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,080
 He just wants to take full advantage of my value.

52
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,260
 I'm not going to take the bait.

53
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,820
What?

54
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,940
You think I'm taking advantage of you?

55
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,000
You see no merit in me?

56
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,940
 Good night.

57
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,460
 Night.

58
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,400
Senior, you're looking for me?

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,940
Stop running around with your injury.

60
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,800
I told you to stay in your room and wait for me.

61
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,900
Why did you come out?

62
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm good. Just a mild injury.

63
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
I was concerned if you had any emergency to tell me,

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,460
so I came to you.

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,600
President Ji, why did you come downstairs at this late hour?

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,300
You guys are still up at this late hour.

67
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
I came to get a drink. You go ahead.

68
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,460
You got wet in the rain.

69
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,280
I happen to have a pack of ginger tea.

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,020
Let me make it for you.

71
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,020
It's not so hot, I guess.

72
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,740
Drink it to dispel the chill.

73
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,700
You also got wet.

74
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,740
You should have some, too.

75
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm good. It's yours.

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,900
- You drink this. 
 - Come on.

77
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,520
- You drink it. 
 - No.

78
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,300
- You go first. 
 - You go.

79
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,180
You go first.

80
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,180
I got wet, too.

81
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,320
Let me drink it if you don't.

82
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,220
Well, you are physically weak by nature.

83
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,680
You need this more than we do.

84
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,980

85
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,600
Xin Xin, Brother Zhang Hao won't be at the café for the next few days?

86
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,360
He went to the training center with Zhou Tian and others.

87
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
It's a long way from there. By the seaside.

88
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,260
It takes a long time on the way.

89
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,740
 Excuse me, your packages.

90
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,660
Coming.

91
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,920
- So big. Who are they coming for? 
 - Mr. Zhang Hao.

92
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
Oh, right.

93
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,520
Put it in there, please. Here.

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,380
Watch out.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,020
- Packages are here. 
 - Thank you.

96
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,980
Do you know what these are?

97
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,240
Some decorative lamps. Brother Hao asked me to buy it for him.

98
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,700
Are they used in the café?

99
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,080
I guess not.

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,140
He told me to deliver them to the training center once they arrive.

101
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,260
How about you stay in the café? I'll deliver them to him right away.

102
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,000
Xin Xin,

103
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,100
why does Brother Hao want these lamps?

104
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,040
I don't know.

105
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,480
Keep it in mind. Pay less attention to the affairs of our boss.

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,280
Well... How about leaving it to me?

107
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,660
As a junior, I should take on more errands for you.

108
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,060
Good, Gigi. You're getting more thoughtful.

109
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,160
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

110
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,660
Brother Hao left his car here. You can drive his car.

111
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,260
Take care.

112
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh, do you know where it is?

113
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,900
No worries. I'll follow the navigation.

114
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,840
All right.

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,300
Here.

116
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,160
Yes, right.

117
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,360
The fireworks must be ready before 7 p.m.

118
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll inform you through the interphone when it's time to light them.

119
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,720
On the hill opposite the beach.

120
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,900
You can see it on the beach.

121
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,160
All right, no problem.

122
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
Thanks.

123
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,200
Hi, Tian Tian.

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,620
Are you available tonight?

125
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,560
I want you to do me a favor.

126
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,540
Just on the beach beside the training center, around 8 p.m.

127
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,680

128
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,660
Yes. The beach where we used to go.

129
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,120
All right. See you at 8 p.m.

130
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,040
 Not a special date.

131
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,740
 Not a festival.

132
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,260
 He prepared so much stuff. And he asked Zhou Tian out.

133
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,320
 What is he up to?

134
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,920
 I bet he's not up to any good.

135
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,260
Hi, Brother Hao.

136
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,660
I'm at the gate.

137
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,400
Didn't I ask Xin Xin to do this?

138
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,980
What? I'm not welcome?

139
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,460
No, no.

140
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,200
Wait for a second. I'll be there in a minute.

141
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,160
Gigi.

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,380
Brother Zhang Hao.

143
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,580
Thank you so much. You drove a long way to deliver them to me.

144
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,720
No biggie. They are in the trunk.

145
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,780
Here. Give this to me.

146
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
- Be careful. 
 - All right.

147
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
It's heavy.

148
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,740
By the way, Brother Zhang Hao.

149
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,940
Is this the place where you usually take the training?

150
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,080
Yes. It's our training center.

151
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,100
But our normal training takes place downtown.

152
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,840
We only come here once a year for closed intensive training.

153
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,920
Oh, I was planning to ask Xin Xin to do me a favor.

154
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,280
Tell me. I can help you.

155
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,200
- Okay. Let's get in first. 
 - Okay.

156
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Let's go.

157
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,480
So, it's quite far from the city.

158
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
I can't rest assured to let you drive alone in the evening.

159
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm thinking you'd better stay here for a night.

160
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,240
There are no more rooms in the building where we are staying.

161
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
But I'll get you one somewhere else.

162
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm good with it.

163
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,120
Good.

164
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,860
Brother Zhang Hao, what are you doing with so many lamps?

165
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
That's why I need your help.

166
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,840
You'll know soon.

167
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,700
Gigi, what are you doing here?

168
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,480
I delivered something to Brother Zhang Hao.

169
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,300
-  Let me carry it for you. 
 - It's all right. I can handle it.

170
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,780
Ji Nian...

171
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,140
President Ji, you know her name?

172
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,800
I saw her in the café.

173
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,840
I don't think I have an impression of the guest.

174
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,440
Wait. Gigi, you are also surnamed Ji.

175
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you have any family ties?

176
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,420
You are also surnamed Ji?

177
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,140
What's your name?

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,520
- Ji Chen. 
 - Ji Chen?

179
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,280
Not a good name.

180
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,360
Senior, what are these in the cases?

181
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
N-Nothing.

182
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Gigi. Come and help me with something.

183
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,040
Let's go.

184
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,220
- We're off, then. 
 - All right.

185
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,760
Be cautious.

186
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,540
Put them here.

187
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,460
Okay.

188
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,000
These are solar-powered lamps.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,960
Gigi, place them in the shape of a heart on the beach.

190
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,600
They will give out the light at night.

191
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,240
The shape of a heart?

192
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,200
Brother Zhang Hao, you are gonna confess your feeling to someone, aren't you?

193
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,460
I'm wondering who is so lucky?

194
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,400
Is she Tian Tian?

195
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,280
Yes.

196
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,400
Why?

197
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,580
Nothing.

198
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,540
It's a bit surprising to me.

199
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,660
So none of you know I have a thing for Tian Tian.

200
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,060
You are nice to every girl.

201
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,900
How could I know who you like?

202
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,740
That's my problem.

203
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,240
I have to make my feelings clearer to her.

204
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Speaking of that, I should thank you.

205
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,940
Gigi, you enlightened me.

206
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,840
You told me last time that

207
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,780
the confession should be made at a place where it's special to both parties.

208
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,380
It reminded me of the beach.

209
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,780
We took the training here when we were young.

210
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,740
I found her on this beach

211
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,980
when she ran out of the training center.

212
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,820
That night, we saw the Bioluminescent Oceans.

213
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,740
It was so amazing.

214
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,980
 I still remember her rushing into the sea

215
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,240
 and dancing around.

216
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,380
 She said she would come to see this every year.

217
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,140
But the Bioluminescent Oceans only appear for a short period every year.

218
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,060
Sometimes, it hits our training time.

219
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,020
Or I went out for competitions.

220
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,860
Anyway, we've been missing the view all these years.

221
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,320
But this year, it appears right in the next few days.

222
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,700
So I was planning

223
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,160
to confess my feelings to her in the place

224
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,020
where we share the same memory.

225
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,420
I want to give her another memorable experience.

226
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,620
Tian Tian is really lucky

227
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,960
to have such a good man in her life.

228
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,980
Brother Zhang Hao, hope you can make it.

229
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,980
Come on.

230
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,160
Here.

231
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,660
What's up?

232
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,140
- Where are you? 
 - Why? Are you stalking me?

233
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,720
Is caring for you what you call stalking?

234
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,200
Well. It's not.

235
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,220
By the way,

236
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,900
what are those in the cases that Zhang Hao asked you to deliver?

237
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,840
 Ball lamps.

238
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,460
What are they used for?

239
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,620
He...

240
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,580
He's going to make those lamps the shape of a heart on the beach,

241
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,680
and confess his feelings to Tian Tian.

242
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
What are you doing?

243
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,760
Zhang Hao is going to confess his love!

244
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,460
So what?

245
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,760
"So what?"

246
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,220
You just going to stand aside

247
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,220
and watch them have a happy ending?

248
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,380
What does it have to do with me?

249
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Stop talking back!

250
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,940
The moment you knew Zhou Tian was Sunday,

251
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,860
you'd fallen in love with her.

252
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't deny it.

253
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,840
Think over what you've done for her.

254
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,940
Every single thing is proof of your affection for her.

255
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,660
Sent meals to her crew,

256
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,980
or made noodles for her.

257
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,240
You know what?

258
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,180
Since Nian Nian left for school,

259
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,780
I've never seen you make noodles for anyone else.

260
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
- I... 
 - Not now.

261
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,260
Let me finish.

262
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,900
And you came to the training center.

263
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,780
Did you come for Qiao Yi?

264
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,700
Come on. Qiao Yi just came to shoot some videos.

265
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,500
Does something as trivial as that require a CEO to deal with?

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,100
What's more, you didn't intend to come.

267
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
You heard that Zhang Hao would come.

268
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,860
That was why you followed them here.

269
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
You're always been a calm person.

270
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,240
Your heart rate never rises above 120 per minute.

271
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,920
Look at you. How many times has it gone beyond that rate?

272
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,960
Stop it. You're nagging. Are you done?

273
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,460
It means that a nagger is living in your heart,

274
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,500
but you just refuse to admit it.

275
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,000
Fine. Figure out something.

276
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,000
What can I do?

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,860
You are an expert at it.

278
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,300
You know best how to play tricks.

279
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,140
You can do it! For our beloved.

280
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,360
 I can't let Zhang Hao's confession be successful.

281
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm worn out.

282
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,040
Didn't sleep well.

283
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,260
Do you have any food here?

284
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,560
Like rice noodles or something?

285
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,740
Qiao Yi, don't you think you have lost a good deal of your hair in recent days?

286
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,340
You also discovered that? My hair falls out when I'm in a fuzzy state of mind.

287
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,660
It appears that your stay here is not that satisfactory.

288
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,260
How about this? I arranged for you some interviews with a few athletes.

289
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,080
How about we finish our work ahead of schedule?

290
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,740
You, me, and Zhou Tian. Let's leave together.

291
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,860
Now, I'll ask the driver to get the car here.

292
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,740
Let me pack your luggage for you.

293
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,140
 I bet you won't hang in there for three days.

294
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,700
Are you happy with that?

295
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,120
I'm not going to leave.

296
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,240
- Aren't you worn out, and in a fuzzy state of mind? 
 - That's true.

297
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,900
But staying in such a beautiful place,

298
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,590
and leading a regular life, with substantial food and drink, and some fresh air.

299
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,380
I've been in love with the place.

300
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,440
Honestly, since I came here, though I haven't had much inspiration,

301
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,980
I believe those experiences and accumulations of life

302
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,140
would sooner or later make their way in my mind.

303
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,120
So I decide to stay longer here.

304
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,300
What a stubborn guy.

305
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,260
Director Kevin.

306
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,080
Director Kevin, this is Qiao Yi's schedule for next week.

307
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,880
Please check it.

308
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,620
Among them, Baoli Show on Thursday remains a top priority.

309
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,500
I heard you're responsible for this.

310
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,860
President Ji specially put me in full charge of the event before he left.

311
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,680
President Ji is said to be a candidate to be promoted to deputy chairman from the current staff.

312
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,680
You are doing great with President Ji. It seems...

313
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,740
Keep it low.

314
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,980
Let me take it.

315
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,300
Hello, President Ji.

316
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
How are you doing there?

317
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,500
How's the build-up to the Baoli Show going?

318
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,860
I'll go through the process today including the styling designer, dressing room, etc.

319
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,090
 All of them will be confirmed today. Please rest assured.

320
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,120
Well, you don't have to take care of this. I'll ask Zhou Tian to come back and deal with it.

321
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,760
 What happened to President Ji?

322
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,380
 Why doesn't he trust me suddenly?

323
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,920
 Hello?

324
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,840
O-Okay.

325
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,960
 No. It's must be Zhou Tian's trick.

326
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,460
 I must show President Ji.

327
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,600
 I, Kevin, am all-powerful.

328
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,380
 I'm doing my job 100 times better than Zhou Tian is.

329
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,500
This... Well...

330
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,480
President Ji, anything I can help you with?

331
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,780
Qiao Yi has a brand event next week.

332
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,640
You go back to the company now to confirm the general process with them.

333
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,200
Confirm the style with the designer.

334
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Then choose Qiao Yi's dresses in advance, and send pictures to me.

335
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,120
Go to the event site to identify the location of the dressing room.

336
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,160
Then do a detailed timetable and roadmap from Qiao Yi when he gets off the car to the red carpet.

337
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,180
Down to the minutes.

338
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,300
S-So many tasks. I shall leave now?

339
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,080
Yes, immediately.

340
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,320
I guess I can't make my return here tonight.

341
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,740
Don't worry about that.

342
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,860
Just stay in the city.

343
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,660
You have some other work to do tomorrow.

344
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,280
I see. Thank you, President Ji. I'll go pack my stuff up

345
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,940
Don't bother. I'll find someone to pack them up for you.

346
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,560
Just set off right now. The driver is waiting for you at the gate.

347
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,420
Okay, let me get my purse.

348
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,900
Hello, Senior.

349
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,560
I have to go back for some urgent business.

350
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm afraid I can't come back tonight.

351
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
 So sudden?

352
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,500
Can't you deal with it tomorrow?

353
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,780
It's urgent.

354
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm so sorry.

355
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,420
Can we take a rain check?

356
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,120
All right. Rain check.

357
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,100
President Ji, I want to verify the stuff with you.

358
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,720
I'll first confirm the process, and then the designer.

359
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,820
After that, I'll verify the styles, and then send the pictures of the outfits to you.

360
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,780
Finally, it's the roadmap from getting off the car to the dressing room.

361
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,760
Apart from them...

362
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Hello, Director Kevin.

363
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,840
 Zhou Tian, I just want to tell you that I've done everything President Ji bid.

364
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,000
 You don't have to come back.

365
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,400
 The process, roadmap, schedule, and pictures of the dresses have all been sent to President Ji.

366
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,800
Director Kevin is awesome.

367
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,960
He has done everything you bid.

368
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,780
President Ji, should I still go back?

369
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,610
Senior has something he wants to talk to me about tonight.

370
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,250
If there isn't any other urgent matters,

371
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,720
could I return to the company tomorrow morning?

372
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,220
I can leave at the early hour.

373
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,900
Hello, Senior. I don't have to go back.

374
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,160
Just keep our original schedule.

375
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,520
See you tonight.

376
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,320
 You think you're cool when you're saying this, right?

377
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,780
 But it only proves you're dictatorial and cheap.

378
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,440
 Then you tell him your education background, and what job you've ever done?

379
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
 What's wrong with my education?

380
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,680
 You're just a ruthless crocodile in his heart.

381
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,120
 I'll definitely fight till the end with the evil force.

382
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
 I like her.

383
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,680
 No one knows us better than we know each other.

384
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,300
 We shall never be apart in my life.

385
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200

386
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
- Tian Tian. 
 - Senior.

387
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,420
Didn't we agree to meet on the beach?

388
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,620
It's still early, so I came to wait for you.

389
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,400
Do you remember our first visit here?

390
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,880
Sure. I ran away because the training was too tough.

391
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,460
I got lost here.

392
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,500
I cried, and you came to look for me.

393
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,960
What happened then?

394
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,360
Then?

395
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,680
Then we saw the beautiful Bioluminescent Oceans.

396
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,540
The whole sea was glowing with blue light.

397
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,700
The waves rose and fell.

398
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,540
It was so beautiful.

399
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,560
I said back then that I would come here every year.

400
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,540
But we never make it happen.

401
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,480
Brother, you want to follow them?

402
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,220
I didn't expect you to like Zhou Tian.

403
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,080
No.

404
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,320
Then why don't you follow them?

405
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,940
You just want to stand here and watch Brother Zhang Hao express his feelings to Tian?

406
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,300
It's not your style.

407
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,460
You never allowed yourself to be a coward.

408
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,620
I'm not.

409
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,040
But I found out that

410
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,880
they do have many common memories.

411
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,120
While I'm in no position to step into his shoes.

412
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,880
If Zhou Tian said yes to Zhang Hao.

413
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,020
I...

414
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,740
I will respect her choice.

415
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,290
I will not trouble her with my wishful thinking,

416
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,440
and leave her in a dilemma.

417
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,040
Not trouble her with your wishful thinking.

418
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,400
By the way,

419
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,980
what are you doing here?

420
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,420
To witness the critical moment of my idol.

421
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,320
Brother, do you want to eavesdrop?

422
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,840
Come with me.

423
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,680
It's as beautiful as it was years ago.

424
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,960
Yes. I always wanted to take you back and watch this one more time.

425
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,600
Senior, I really appreciate it.

426
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,340
Tian Tian, come with me.

427
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,160
Tian Tian, come in here.

428
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:24,880
Tian Tian, I've asked myself when I started to have a crush on you.

429
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,400
I had no idea, either.

430
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,860
Since we were young, I'm used to having you in my life.

431
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,520
We never parted either in life or in training.

432
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,020
You have appeared in every one of my unforgettable memories.

433
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,640
Tian Tian. Maybe you feel like it's a bit abrupt.

434
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,580
But as I've told you long ago, I've always thought we we are family.

435
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,140
More than the past, but now, and even the future,

436
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,380
I hope I can protect you,

437
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,620
take care of you, and stay with you forever.

438
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,800
I want to make you the happiest and most carefree girl in the world.

439
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,060
Zhou Tian.

440
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,740
♫  I never thought my heart would flutter for you  ♫

441
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,360
♫  From our first encountered in the crowd  ♫

442
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:54,320
♫  In my eyes, you're one of a kind on this planet  ♫

443
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,300
♫  I hope you'd understand  ♫

444
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,340
♫  I want to be more than just your friend  ♫

445
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,080
♫  Without any reason  ♫

446
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,910
♫  I just want to take you away  ♫

447
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,660
Senior,

448
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,460
I've always liked you.

449
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,640
But my feelings for you

450
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,280
are merely something between

451
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,720
fellows, friends,

452
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,480
as well as siblings.

453
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,800
I know I've always been lucky.

454
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,460
I have you to protect me during my development years.

455
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,240
Each time I got injured, you took care of me.

456
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,420
And each time I made a good result,

457
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,960
you were there to cheer for me.

458
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,160
But I've grown up.

459
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,580
I'm no longer the little girl you took under your wings.

460
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,260
I can face the ups and downs myself, and aim to become a better person.

461
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,340
However, you still treat me like a child.

462
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,410
I know, it's a type of care for me,

463
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,720
just like the caring between siblings.

464
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:43,320
So my feelings for you cannot be called love.

465
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,040
Maybe your feelings all these years

466
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,860
were for that girl who secretly came here to cry

467
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:15,180
because of exhaustion, grievance, and homesickness.

468
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,200
For that girl

469
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,660
who need your help, comfort, and protection.

470
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,200
But I'm not the little girl who I used to be.

471
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,980
I'm sorry.

472
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,620
I can't give you the answer you wish to hear.

473
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,540
Maybe you don't want to see me anymore.

474
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,580
I understand it.

475
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,740
Yet I'll wait patiently until you cool down.

476
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,520
I'll feel better

477
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,140
if you think we can go back to the way we used to be.

478
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,400
You should give a part of this care for me to someone else.

479
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,980
In that case, you'll encounter your true love.

480
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,080
So, I don't have the chance, right?

481
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,100
I truly treat you

482
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,940
as my brother. And that's all.

483
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,300
See? What did I say?

484
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,220
They're just brother and sister, and that's all.

485
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,620
It's all right. The wind blows from them to us.

486
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,620
We can hear what they say. But they can't hear us.

487
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,420
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

488
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:47,240

489
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,782
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

490
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:55,742
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫
