1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,430
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,630
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,330
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,130
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,800
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:39,200
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,860

16
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,580

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,430
I've dug everything out.

18
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,080
He has a house and a car.

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,920
But there's one thing I'm sorry about.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,500
Both his parents are dead.

21
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,010
So, in the future, we have to look after the two kids more.

22
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,160
But Ji Chen is tall and handsome.

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Loyal and omnipotent. Obedient and capable.

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,220
He doesn't smoke or drink, and seldom hangs out with people.

25
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,550
No first love or romantic history. No bad habits.

26
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,580
So reliable and can be trusted.

27
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,900
I observed him for a whole day.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,470
Ji Chen treats Tian really well.

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,590
But I'm worried what we said and we did today

30
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,790
would make him think we are greedy.

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,980
How dare he? He won't.

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,840
We did all for our daughter.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,700
When I was still a poor wretch, didn't you choose me from a group of men?

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,690
That's different. Children now are different from when we were young.

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,070
Xiao Chen said we could stay in the house tonight.

36
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,170
Really?

37
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,830
No way.

38
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,870
You... It's impolite to refuse Xiao Chen's invitation.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,780
It's not good.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,780
If you want to stay here,

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,390
I'll go.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,540
There are two floors.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,720
Which floor do we live on?

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,840
The second floor. There are many rooms
on the second floor.

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,390
Really. The sea is visible from the bathroom.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,070
Great.

47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,010
Uncle, Auntie, there are enough rooms.

48
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,130
You can choose which room you want to stay.

49
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,350
- How about we go upstairs now? 
 - All right.

50
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,780
Now? How about waiting for a while?

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,260
It's still early now. I can't fall asleep.

52
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,630
Do you have mahjong at home?

53
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,270
I think we can play mahjong together.

54
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,370
How could he have mahjong at home?

55
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,190
I do. Definitely.

56
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,100
I have whatever you want at home.

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,040
That's terrific!

58
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,420
Brother Zhang Hao,

59
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,420
you came back to the café alone.

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,380
I'm worried that you would break something.

61
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,290
I have been living here for a good while.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,280
Nothing has ever happened.

63
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,060
Are you just worried about me?

64
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,210
Sorry, I knocked on the wrong door.

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,160
Is this President Ji's house?

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,100
Why is there a woman who looks so much like Zhou Tian?

67
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,610
I must be so annoyed with her that I had an illusion.

68
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,300
Kevin.

69
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,220
You are really Zhou Tian?

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,840
What's wrong?

71
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,190
I see.

72
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,840
Rest assured. I didn't come here tonight, nor did you.

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,070
What happened at night will disappear at dawn.

74
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,010
Where is mahjong?

75
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,800
President Ji, I brought it for you.

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,930
Sorry, it's too late.

77
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,040
I only found this made of common materials.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,810
Carry it in.

79
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,720
President Ji, are we playing Shanghai mahjong, Beijing mahjong,or Sichuan mahjong?

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,760
You may be excused.

81
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,920
All right. Goodbye.

82
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,880
Go, let's go.

83
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,620
Three Bamboo.

84
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,510
North Wind.

85
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,410
Xiao Chen, playing mahjong is simple.

86
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't worry. I promise to teach you how to play.

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,610
I only watchedsome tutorials online.

88
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,460
Xiao Chen, you are so smart.

89
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,980
Play it with us and you'll know.

90
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,840
This...

91
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,010
Can you make it faster?

92
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,840
Even the old people are faster than you.

93
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,660
Of course. Old people play mahjong every day.

94
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,600
Xiao Chen, take your time.

95
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,820
Bingo!

96
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
Hold on.

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,270
I suspect that Chen made a wrong move.

98
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,950
Xiao Chen, I'm on my honor. Trust me.

99
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,190
I'll check your cards for you.

100
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,640
- See? You shouldn't gave this. 
 - A wrong step.

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,380
You missed it.

102
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,900
Take this one back.

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,320
And exchange this one.

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,430
You can't take it back.

105
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,020
Who do you learn it from?

106
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,680
Kiddo, don't be that mean.

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,030
I didn't teach you like this.

108
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,040
We are family. Be nice.

109
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,690
Forget it. I'll give you a chance.

110
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,330
I will win by my own draw.

111
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,170
Good for you.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,200
Seven Dot.

113
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,050
Three Dot.

114
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,400
South Wind.

115
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,770
Xiao Chen, you won.

116
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,060
Look. You won.

117
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,960
- Exactly. 
 - Look.

118
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,700
I won?

119
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,110
Who on earth is your birth child?

120
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to get off...

121
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,760
No worries.

122
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,010
I know I must have said something wrong.

123
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,240
No. My parents are conventional.

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,260
But you are straightforward.

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,840
I was afraid that they couldn't accept you.

126
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,880
I understand.

127
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,780
Why didn't you mention your parents before?

128
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,410
You didn't even ask me.

129
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,610
That's right. I had no idea Ji Chen is your brother, let alone your parents.

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,260
My father had a sudden heart attack when he was driving when I was 11.

131
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,330
And we had an accident.

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,230
My mother was also in the car.

133
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,730
 No.

134
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,750
 No. Don't leave us.

135
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,450
 Please.

136
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,210
 Don't leave us.

137
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,860
 My parents left a sum of insurance benefit and deposit to us.

138
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,800
 Ji Chen was 18 then.

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,440
 To take better care of me,

140
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,690
 he took me to seek shelter with one of our relatives abroad.

141
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,480
He finished his study over there,

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,250
and sent me to a college of music.

143
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,820
After he started to work, he got promoted soon because of his capability.

144
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,950
He was assigned home as Xing Yi's CEO by An Sheng Group.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,420
While I was in the Juilliard School then.

146
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,450
Since Ji Chen was transferred home,

147
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,470
I hid it from him and bought a flight ticket to return.

148
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,330
You know what happened later.

149
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,210
You look happy like a princess,

150
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,850
but I didn't expect you to have such past experiences.

151
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,930
I still have a lot of things you never heard of.

152
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,600
We have a long way to go. You can learn about me later.

153
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,110
Good. Good phrase.

154
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,880
Because I was born wise.

155
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,090
But I have never seen you show your musical skills.

156
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,650
It's not a free show.

157
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,350
Wait.

158
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,220
I won.

159
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,100
Wait. You can't make it.

160
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,480
It's unlucky. You can't.

161
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,780
Mom, don't play tricks.

162
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,800
Your mother is right.

163
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,380
Fine, I quit.

164
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm sleepy.

165
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,800
I feel a bit hungry.

166
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,410
Auntie, there are all kinds of food in the fridge. Please come with me.

167
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,520
Really?

168
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,150
What do you mean?

169
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,850
You are biased to Ji Chen.

170
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,830
The son-in-law is better than the daughter.

171
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,140
What the hell son-in-law? I haven't accepted him.

172
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,360
Then why did you take us to meet him?

173
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,860
Right. I'm satisfied with Ji Chen.

174
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,510
Are you sure?

175
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,830
Do you have any idea how many health care products he eats every day?

176
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,380
He's so weak.

177
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,760
You also take health care products of this brand?

178
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,470
So do I.

179
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,650
I just started to eat it. It's pretty good.

180
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,250
That's right, Auntie. I'm a platinum member of this brand.

181
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,310
I can get a 22% discount on their products.

182
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,260
Feel free to tell me if you want to buy.

183
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,900
A 22% discount can save a lot of money, right?

184
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,560
Exactly.

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,580
What's this?

186
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,230
It's a new arrival.

187
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,230
For people of different ages, it has different functions, and contains over 20 vitamins.

188
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,630
 Moreover, it s shelf life is only one month.

189
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,900
After a month...

190
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,110
Are you obsessed with me?

191
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,370
I... I'm not.

192
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,210
You liar.

193
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,010
What if I'm going to kiss you now?

194
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,890
Fine. I was joking.

195
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,430
Before you really fall in love with me,

196
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,680
I won't take advantage of you.

197
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,570
It's getting late.

198
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,990
Go back and have a good sleep. I will go home.

199
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm also sleepy.

200
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,050
Brother Zhang Hao, please turn off the lights and close the door before you leave.

201
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,750
Good night.

202
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,210
President Ji, these are what you want.

203
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,650
So many boxes.

204
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,410
It's all right. Don't mention it.

205
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,820
But it's hard for us to take these boxes back.

206
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,950
I see.

207
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,500
Kevin, take them away.

208
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,310
Send them through the post tomorrow.

209
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,800
Nevermind. No need.

210
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,670
The post would only put it downstairs.

211
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,020
We are unable to carry them...

212
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,650
Kevin, arrange two cars tomorrow.

213
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,460
One is to take Uncle and Auntie back, and the other takes these gifts.

214
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,320
Remember to carry them into their house.

215
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,770
Got it.

216
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,400
T-That's too troublesome.

217
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,100
Well... Thank you so much.

218
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,680
We brought much trouble to you. It's no biggie.

219
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,800
Don't mention it. Watch your steps.

220
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,510
Thank you.

221
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,860
So many things.

222
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,780
We really brought him too much trouble.

223
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,750
Old Zhou, Xiao Chen is too thoughtful. What a considerate boy.

224
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,090
He's really nice.

225
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,400
- I feel sorry. 
 - It's not good.

226
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,390
Really. He prepared so many gifts for us.

227
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,730
Dad, Mom, let me tell you.

228
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,820
Ji Chen lies on the massage armchair every day like a turtle.

229
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,500
Xiao Chen, this is so comfortable.

230
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,010
We also have one at home.

231
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,130
Once I use it, my whole body aches.

232
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,560
Uncle, the massage armchair is a limited edition.

233
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,210
I booked the same one for you.

234
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,910
I didn't mean that.

235
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,570
I'll help you move the old one away.

236
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,570
I really didn't mean that.

237
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,580
All right. Since both of you like him that much, stay here with him.

238
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,020
If you don't want to go,

239
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,510
I'll go.

240
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,680
Wait...

241
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,830
Choose a good date, and have them engaged.

242
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,260
No need to engage.

243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,970
They can directly get married.

244
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,860
Okay. Let's choose the best date.

245
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,490
No way.

246
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,710
What's wrong with you? Didn't you go home already? What are you doing here?

247
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,040
I changed my mind. I'll stay.

248
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,880
You are changeable as your mother.

249
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,310
I'm telling you. You always get up at noon.

250
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,070
Before 6 a.m. tomorrow, you'll be woken up by this guy.

251
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,620
I just want another opportunity.

252
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,200
Save it. I don't want to talk to you.

253
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,650
Why don't you listen to my explanation?

254
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,190
Do you think make my parents satisfied with you

255
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,940
and you'll get a pass card of me?

256
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,050
Listen, it's impossible!

257
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,640
♫  I never thought my heart would flutter for you  ♫

258
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,870
♫  From our first encountered in the crowd  ♫

259
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,910
♫  In my eyes, you're one of a kind on this planet  ♫

260
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,900
♫  I hope you'd understand  ♫

261
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,960
♫  I want to be more than just your friend  ♫

262
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
Tian'er,

263
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,900
Tian'er, the electricity is off!

264
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,050
It's so dark. I'm not to see anything.

265
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,250
The power is cut off.

266
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

267
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,150
Hey, Zhou Tian, listen to me...

268
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,250
Night, President Ji.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,360
I can't be tricked by his sugar-coated bullets.

270
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,120
My hormone went wrong.

271
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,720
What a day.

272
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,410
What's wrong with this guy?

273
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,050
Playing music at this early hour?

274
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,480
Is he playing Tai Chi as old people do?

275
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,690
So noisy.

276
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,180
Can't you consider your guests at home?

277
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,640
What the hell are you doing?

278
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,160
Tian'er, time to get up.

279
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,700
It's not your style.

280
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,010
The eight sections brocade that Xiao Chen taught us

281
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,160
stretched my whole body.

282
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:37,860
It seems that going to bed and getting up early is a healthy lifestyle.

283
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:47,580
It's the best way for us old people.

284
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,390
You are incurable.

285
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:03,400
It was hard for Zhou Tian to get up when she was on the sports team.

286
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,340
To make her get up on her own,

287
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,270
I made a lot of food for her.

288
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,090
She is a foodie.

289
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,150
To enjoy the breakfast I made for her,

290
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,910
she got up early, sitting at the table as she yawned,

291
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,160
she waited for the yummy food I cooked.

292
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,240
Later, she entered the provincial team.

293
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,100
Each time I visited her, I would bring rice balls for her

294
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,870
with "You can do it!" written on it.

295
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,720
Gradually, she is no longer the little girl, and has a boyfriend.

296
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,660
Uncle, please rest assured.

297
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,990
I'll take care of Zhou Tian.

298
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,000
Taking care of her is not as simple as the three words.

299
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,110
Learn to make the rice ball.

300
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,620
If she feels tired or upset, cook this for her.

301
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,610
I promise she'll beam.

302
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,750
My daughter is amenable to persuasion but not to coercion.

303
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,420
This is the rice ball I cooked with Xiao Chen. Can you tell what is written on it?

304
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,410
I see "You can do it!" and "Morning".

305
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,660
This one...

306
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,650
is a bit abstract.

307
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,760
It's a small hill.

308
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,870
It's Qiu Qiu.

309
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,260
I have been watching my phone too much recently.

310
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,600
My eyes blurred.

311
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,650
I can't see it clearly.

312
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,480
Zhou Tian, what are you laughing at?

313
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,540
Zhou Tian, stop laughing.

314
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,720
It's good that Xiao Chen is willing to learn how to cook.

315
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,050
Though he is innocent, you cannot pick on him because of his innocence.

316
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,410
Innocent?

317
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,810
Are you sure he's innocent?

318
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,650
He is such a cunning guy.

319
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,130
I'm the one who's innocent. I'm afraid he'll sell me someday.

320
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,320
He's so rich.

321
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,030
Why should he sell you?

322
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,490
Besides, you are a fool.

323
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,310
How much are you worth?

324
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,070
Mom!

325
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,740
Tian'er, your mother is right.

326
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,440
You were born stupid.

327
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,320
Accept the fact. You got your IQ from your father.

328
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,980
But it's not the reason you pick on him. Understand?

329
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,380
Who is stupid?

330
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,110
I'm talking about Zhou Tian. None of your business.

331
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,200
Well.

332
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,060
Dad, are you my birth father?

333
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,130
Why not?

334
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,170
I'm not stupid.

335
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,790
- How could you ask such a stupid question? 
 - Right?

336
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,030
- He's of course your birth father. 
 - Exactly.

337
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,660
I'll open the door.

338
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,620
- No. 
 - Didn't I say this for Zhou Tian's good?

339
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,690
You have such a bad memory.

340
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,990
How? I...

341
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,320
Kevin?

342
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,560
You... What...

343
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,610
Have you prepared everything I told you?

344
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,520
President Ji, everything is ready.

345
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,070
Where are they?

346
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,830

347
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,320
Uncle, Auntie, I prepared two cars here.

348
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,450
You take the one ahead.

349
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,450
After picking up Uncle and Auntie Zhang, you can go home.

350
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,140
I prepared some gifts and health care products you can go home.

351
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,360
Don't forget to eat and use them.

352
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,450
I'll deliver to you when you need anything.

353
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,830
That's too many things.

354
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,650
Not at all.

355
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,760
Dad, Mom.

356
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,010
Xiao Hao, your father wants to have a word with you.

357
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,920
Me?

358
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,440
Isn't there a conversation of men between the two of you?

359
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,980
- Haozi. 
 - Dad.

360
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,390
Your mother and I talked the whole night.

361
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,020
You have been staying outside alone all these years.

362
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,360
Well.

363
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,800
We are far from you, and we cannot... you know.

364
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,020
You are alone, and we, you know.

365
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm still, you know.

366
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,040
You know what I mean?

367
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,330
But sometimes I didn't really...

368
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,980
You know?

369
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,050
Anyway, no matter what you want you know.

370
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,480
You got me?

371
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,790
We...

372
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,520
We don't have to be that... you know?

373
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,260
What the hell are you talking about?

374
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,490
Don't you know?

375
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,380
Well. I see.

376
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,320
What?

377
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,260
Our son is of course outstanding, right?

378
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Uncle, Auntie.

379
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,590
Here you go.

380
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,750
Gigi, it's so beautiful.

381
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,420
Beautiful flowers should be presented to a beautiful woman.

382
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,120
What a smooth talker.

383
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,610
What are you doing here?

384
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,330
Uncle and Auntie are going home today. I surely have to see them off.

385
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,020
Thank you. We appreciate it.

386
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,530
Where is your brother?

387
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,100
He said he would come. Why hasn't he arrived?

388
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,660
Old Zhang. Old Zhang. What good weather.

389
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,260
Uncle, Auntie Zhou.

390
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:24,650
Old Zhang. My son-in-law sent us a truck of gifts.

391
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,160
How's it?

392
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
What's inside?

393
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,770
Health care products.

394
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,090
Is it amazing?

395
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,000
Amazing.

396
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,950
Right. Well...

397
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,740
Health care products are really suitable for you.

398
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,220
You do need some nutrition from health care products.

399
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,620
One truck is not even enough.

400
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,800
L-Look at me.

401
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,850
I'm healthy.

402
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,460
I don't need any health care products.

403
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,610
- Here is the thing. 
 - Right.

404
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,980
Ji Chen said that he prepared these gifts for both of us.

405
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,250
If you don't need it, I'll take them for you.

406
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,610
Old Zhou, stopping kidding him.

407
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,920
Old Zhang, just ignore him.

408
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,340
These are gifts from Ji Chen

409
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,510
and Ji Nian.

410
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,700
I certainly will receive the gifts from my future daughter-in-law.

411
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,020
- Come on. 
 - You can't. You will have a nosebleed.

412
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,500
I don't care.

413
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,650
Come on.

414
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,590
Dad, Mom, hurry up.

415
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,800
You'll arrive home at night if you still delay.

416
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,910
Yes. Well, just go back.

417
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,730
- Let's go. 
 - We are leaving. Get in the car.

418
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,460
- See you around. See you around. See you. 
 - All right.

419
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Let's go home.

420
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,910
Ji'er, come with me.

421
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,710
Let's have a conversation between men.

422
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:48,910
If you pick on Tian'er, I'll break your door and destroy your sea view house.

423
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,380
As long as I hear Zhou Tian says that you annoy her,

424
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,990
wherever you are, I'll catch you,

425
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,580
tie you up, and hang you up on the pear trees of our garden.

426
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,660
You won't have a good end.

427
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,450
Uncle, please rest assured.

428
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,810
I won't give you the opportunity.

429
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,520
P-Please take care of my daughter.

430
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,080
If he picks on you, let me know. I'll teach him a lesson.

431
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
I got it.

432
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,110
Nice flowers.

433
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,850
Sure. I chose it myself.

434
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,270
Thank you for receiving my parents.

435
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,670
I'll pay you back the money for those gifts in monthly installments.

436
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,000
You don't have to draw a clear line with me.

437
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,840
These are my gifts to your parents.

438
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,570
Do you think everyone should receive your kindness without reserve?

439
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,110
Or you think my parents accept you which means I accept you?

440
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,730
Listen, it's impossible.

441
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,920
Well, I want to have a word with you.

442
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,540
All right. Perfect timing.

443
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,170
No way.

444
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,920
I'll talk to Brother Zhang Hao by myself.

445
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,290
It's a conversation between two men.

446
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,320
 Oh, my God.

447
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,100
 Why is he such a fast learner?

448
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,240
What the hell conversation between two men?

449
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,830
No way.

450
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,010
- Stop it. 
 -  Let's talk one by one.

451
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,450
Stop!

452
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,660
Brother Zhang Hao!

453
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,920
My foot.

454
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,250
Stay still.

455
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,730
Call the ambulance.

456
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,420

457
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,710
According to his X-ray,

458
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,400
there's no fracture.

459
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,630
He just has a soft tissue contusion,

460
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,640
and he needs some time to recover.

461
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,160
Doctor, how long will it take before he recovers?

462
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,710
His injury is not serious.

463
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,700
But it will take him a month or so to get recovered.

464
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,170
But he still has a cross-country race next month.

465
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,420
I suggest that he should stay still.

466
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,800
Even walking should be cautious.

467
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,290
Running is prohibited.

468
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,640
He'd better not take any high-intensity exercises.

469
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,150
Well, get the formalities done and pay the hospitalization fees.

470
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,700
All right. Thank you, doctor.

471
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,290
You are to blame for this.

472
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,170
What the hell conversation between two men?

473
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,080
You made Brother Zhang Hao fall down.

474
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,820
He cannot take part in the race.

475
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,420
It's not your fault.

477
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,990
It's all good.

478
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,050
I had planned to take a break.

479
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,600
Now it comes true.

480
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,040
Well, you go to work.

481
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,210
Leave me alone.

482
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,260
No. I'll stay here to take care of you.

483
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,710
It's good he's not serious.

484
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,260
After some break, he'll be fine.

485
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,930
What are you talking about?

486
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,650
Do you know what a foot injury means to an athlete?

487
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,240

488
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,540
It makes sense.

489
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,790
A domineering CEO like you would never understand it.

490
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,750
This is the tea I make for President Ji every day.

491
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,220
What President Ji drinks is sugar-free.

492
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,110
If you think it's bitter,

493
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,300
add s piece of sugar.

494
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,660
Morning, Director Kevin.

495
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,270
No, no, no.

496
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,770
That's too much for me.

497
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,300
Since you and President Ji...

498
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,830
You are Mrs. Ji from now on.

499
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,180
Please just call me Kevin.

500
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,590
No. You misunderstood it.

501
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,970
I have been working for President Ji for so many years.

502
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,070
I have never seen President Ji take any woman back home.

503
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,460
You are the first one.

504
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,970
More than that, your father, your mother,

505
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,900
and your whole family was there.

506
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,090
It's a bit complicated to explain to you.

507
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,810
There was a possibility that I might be at your house.

508
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,020
Forget it.

509
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,050
Anyway. Though I know President Ji hates office politics the most,

510
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,520
as his most trustworthy assistant,

511
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,940
it's my duty to take care of anything he cares about.

512
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,420
So if you meet any problems at work, feel free to tell me.

513
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,710
But I don't think you'll meet any problems.

514
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,450
Even if you do, President Ji will deal with it for you.

515
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,570
So your promotion and salary rise will be faster than common employees.

516
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,490
Director Kevin, that's a bit...

517
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,550
Don't mention it.

518
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,310
I didn't expect President Ji to take a fancy to a girl like you.

519
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,370
The rumor said that President Ji is the future son-in-law of the CEO of another group.

520
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,610
The daughter of a CEO is a goddess.

521
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,230
You are not in a good body shape, an outstanding appearance,

522
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,120
or a prominent ability like her,

523
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,420
but President Ji chose you.

524
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm not happy with his choice though,

525
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,590
but I'm a professional assistant.

526
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,390
Even if President Ji chooses a pig,

527
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,180
I'll do everything for her.

528
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,300
Because I respect every decision President Ji makes.

529
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,240
Please enjoy your ginseng tea.

530
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,790
What the hell was he speaking?

531
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,710
What did Ji Chen tell him?

532
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,770
 Have lunch with me.

533
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
In your dreams!

534
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,640

535
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,080

536
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,040

537
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,100

538
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,780

539
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,610
 Why did you delete me?

540
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,940

541
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,010
I forgot this.

542
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,120

543
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,760
I need the job.

544
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,670
I have to yield to life.

545
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,140

546
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,550
 President Ji, it's the working time.

547
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,870
 We should only talk about work.

548
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:44,930

549
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,140
Wow, you're impressive.

550
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,980
I didn't expect you to ruin this place.

551
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,110
Did you throw a bomb here?

552
00:38:55,606 --> 00:39:00,206
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

553
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:04,166
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

554
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:08,666
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

555

♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

556
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:19,296
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

557
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,784
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

558
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:27,601
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

559
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:33,006
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

560
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:37,636
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

561
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:41,006
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

562
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:45,906
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

563
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:50,701
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

564
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:57,243
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

569
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:19,666
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

570
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:24,256
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

571
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:33,536
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

572
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:43,336
