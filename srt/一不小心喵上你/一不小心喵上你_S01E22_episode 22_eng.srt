1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,060

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:34,000
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,300
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,300
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,630
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,690
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,720

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,060

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,560
Zhou Tian, can I go to work tomorrow?

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,870
Nope.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,250
You have to rest.

20
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,920
I...

21
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,480
So good.

22
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,460

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,880
Hi, Kevin.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,000
Pick me up at my home tomorrow morning. I'll go to the company.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,450
President Ji, aren't you supposed to rest, and asked me to leave you alone?

26
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,880
Just do as I bid you. Stop nonsense.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,230
Make sure Zhou Tian is unaware of this!

28
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,870
Unaware of what?

29
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,790
What? You had a hallucination?

30
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,730
How are you feeling? A resting period is good, right?

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,440
Pretty good!

32
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,970
Good morning, President Ji.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Where are you going?

34
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,060
Going to work at the company.

35
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,710
No. The resting period hasn't finished.

36
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,450
You are not allowed to go out before you finish the seven-day rest.

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,680
Just a regular meeting. I'll be back very soon.

38
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,440
Tian Tian, since we are a couple now,

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,600
you have to support me regarding my job.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,080
No. You're prohibited from going out during the resting period.

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,150
Kevin, get everyone to attend the video meeting.

42
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,170
Get up.

43
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,140
Sorry. I put the wrong filter.

44
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,270
 Good morning, everyone.

45
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,650
 Good morning, President Ji.

46
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,100
The meeting will last for half an hour. Please don't waste time.

47
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,370
Sit down, please.

48
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,450

49
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,110
The meeting will begin.

50
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,690
President Ji, I have sent the specific schedule of each singer

51
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,300
in this month to your mailbox.

52
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,500
 All right, I'll check it later and reply to you through e-mail.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,560
The discussion with new athletes has all been done.

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,260
The papers and contracts have been signed. Waiting for your instruction.

55
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,770
 I'll read them later.

56
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,890
 Has Qiao Yi's endorsement contract been delivered to us?

57
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,000
I have revised it and sent it back.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,960
 Confirm it as soon as possible.

59
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
 Carry forward some film-promoting projects of a few actors,

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,250
 including the places of their show, time of interview, and details of the interview.

61
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,830
 Confirm these with actors in advance.

62
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,970
 As for TV shows, we have a few new shows in recent months.

63
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,040
-  Please arrange everything in advance.  
 - Time's up. The meeting is over.

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
 I haven't finished yet.

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
Continue the resting. Bye.

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,580

67
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,480

68
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,310
You may be excused.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,460
What's going on?

70
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,110
 President Ji, I think Zhou Tian just wants to take over your position.

71
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,200
 I saw her sitting on your seat,

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,090
 writing with your pen,

73
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,200
 and drinking water with your cup.

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,570
She's my girlfriend.

75
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,050
My stuff is her stuff.

76
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,990
As you said, I don't think there's any problem.

77
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,970
President Ji, there are still a lot of important documents

78
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,110
which Zhou Tian can't make the decision, and need your verification.

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,140
 But Zhou Tian said to have you deal with them after you come back.

80
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,500
 I'm afraid they'll be delayed.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,910
Well, send those documents to me in secret in the evening.

82
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,330
Did you have a good rest during my absence?

83
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,440
Yes, absolutely.

84
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,010
Were you making a call with Kevin, right?

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,170
 President Ji, I think Zhou Tian just wants to take over your position.

86
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,190
 I saw her sitting on your seat,

87
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,240
 writing with your pen,

88
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,700
 and drinking water with your cup.

89
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,150
 She's my girlfriend.

90
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,900
 My stuff is her stuff.

91
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,380
 Freeze.

92
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,290
 Put your hands up.

93
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,340

94
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,750
 You should lie on the bed.

95
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm going to the bathroom.

96
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,370
 You have just come back from the bathroom for five minutes.

97
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,780
How did you know that?

98
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,730
 Lie on the bed and sleep.

99
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,510
Kevin, come to take down all the surveillance cameras at my house tomorrow.

100
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,530
 President Ji, you insisted on installing them, didn't you?

101
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,280
Do what I ask you to do. Don't be so nagging.

102
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,320
 Who are you calling?

103
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,600
 Give me your phone.

104
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,570
Now you can take a good resting period.

105
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,510
Are you getting a bit out of control?

106
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,120
The resting period needs an absolutely quiet environment, right?

107
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,620

108
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,670
President Ji.

109
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,320
Come on.

110
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,970
This way.

111
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,190
Hurry up.

112
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,220
These are all the documents, right?

113
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,630
These are today's papers. There's still another stack on the car.

114
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,970
Let me finish them first, and you get me the rest.

115
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,150
- Hurry up. 
 - Okay.

116
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,400
President Ji, if things go on like this, I guess I'll lose a ten-year lifespan.

117
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,640
You'll get a salary rise.

118
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,670
President Ji, when will you return to the company?

119
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,930
When Zhou Tian allows to let me go.

120
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,760
Zhou Tian is too overbearing.

121
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,050
Kevin?

122
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,100

123
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,550
Ji Chen.

124
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,670
Oh, hell! Zhou Tian woke up. Put them away.

125
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,820
Zhou Tian.

126
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,180
What are you doing at this late hour?

127
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,080
I have got the runs, and I came to the bathroom.

128
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,620
You have a bathroom in your room.

129
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,350
A different place brings me a fresh feeling.

130
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,480
A different place? You mean in the study?

131
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,500
I'd love to read a book sitting on the toilet.

132
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,020
No. I seemed to hear Kevin's voice.

133
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,940
Zhou Tian, I...

134
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,210
Are you nervous?

135
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,660
For what is there to be nervous?

136
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,810
So weird.

137
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,950
Did I have an auditory hallucination?

138
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,410
It must be.

139
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,980
You have been doing a hard time taking care of me recently, and you had an auditory hallucination.

140
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,720
But I'm sure I heard his voice.

141
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,300
You probably heard it in your dream.

142
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,510
- Go to sleep. 
- I did hear his voice.

143
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,090
No. Move to my house tomorrow.

144
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,710
Your house is too large. I can't make good supervision of you.

145
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,840
You have to have good rest.

146
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,520
All right. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

147
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,720
Go to sleep now.

148
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,680

149
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,790
Mind your steps.

150
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,090
Sit here.

151
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,740
Here.

152
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,620
Done?

153
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,980
Wait.

154
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,110
Unpermitted papers.

155
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,060
President Ji, I still have something to do. See you around.

156
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,770
Look, the resting environment I prepared for you is cozy, right?

157
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,430
Very good.

158
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,520
H-How do we live?

159
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,310
What do you mean?

160
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,330
Well... There's only one room.

161
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,100
What's wrong with that?

162
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,340
Then...

163
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,690
Where do I sleep?

164
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,410
On the bed.

165
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,000
Come in.

166
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,280
What's up?

167
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
What are you doing?

168
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm getting a pillow.

169
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Have a good night.

170
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,190
Can't you stop making trouble?

171
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,910
Rest!

172
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,560
I... I can't fall asleep, so I wanted to take a walk.

173
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,040
I think I'm almost recovered.

174
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,500
I can deal with some simple work.

175
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,620
Why can't you listen to the doctor's instructions?

176
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,610
The doctor said you must rest.

177
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,560
But you have to walk around.

178
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,550
What if there's anything wrong with your body? What can I do?

179
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,450
Is this how you take care of yourself?

180
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,250
Zhou Tian, I know you're worried about me.

181
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,750
But your way of resting has been too much.

182
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,760
Do you mean I take it too seriously?

183
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,700
I once thought everyone is as strong as me.

184
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,040
But ever since I have known you, I notice another side of life.

185
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,450
The way you cherish your life, and how fragile you stimulate my desire to protect you.

186
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,780
I love you, so I want to take care of you.

187
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,020
I don't wish to see anything bad happen to you.

188
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,770
Silly girl, I know you're worried about me.

189
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,690
But I used to think that life lies in stillness.

190
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,170
But after the resting for a couple of days,

191
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,070
I found out that there's a limit to everything.

192
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,040
Too much water drowned the miller.

193
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,530
Do you still want the absolute resting period now?

194
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,580
Nope. I just want to take some exercise now.

195
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,630
Take some exercise.

196
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,610
Have you made up your mind?

197
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,770
- Yes. Life lies in movement. 
- Okay.

198
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,550
Let's add some proper exercise from now on.

199
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,170
I have asked my former team doctor to work out a set of exercises in the recovery plan for you.

200
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,050
So in the following days, do as I say.

201
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,660
You have planned everything well, right?

202
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,300
I learned it from you. Good night.

203
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,090
Good night.

204
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,320
Aerobics do good to increase your cardio-pulmonary function.

205
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,810
When you are running, your pulmonary lobes get great training.

206
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,540
Shift your center of body weight forward.

207
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,270
Keep your elbows by your waist.

208
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,060
While you are running, the average speed is 170 to 180 steps per minute.

209
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,270
 Tian'er, where are you?

210
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,990
I'm jogging with Ji Chen.

211
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,320
 I heard Xiao Hao said Xiao Chen was hospitalized.

212
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,670
 How's he doing right now?

213
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,130
 He's such a young man.

214
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,020
 How could he get the heart disease?

215
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,820
 Is heart disease hereditary?

216
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,340
 Will it be passed on to the next generation?

217
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,690
 I'm so worried.

218
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,460
 He's in bad health,

219
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,320
 and you have to spend time with him or take care of him.

220
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,200
He's good. He overworked the other day.

221
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,270
 Really? He's really fine?

222
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,090
 Don't try to fool us.

223
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,570
Really. You can see with your eyes.

224
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,380
 Chen runs quite fast.

225
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,250
 Well. Since he's fine, we could be relieved.

226
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,860
 Go on, go.

227
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,370
 Ji Chen, wait for me.

228
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,650
 The call is over. Drop the act!

229
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,630
No. I have run out of my strength. Can I take a break?

230
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,250
Hang in there a bit longer. You haven't got enough exercise yet.

231
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,210
- I'm exhausted. 
 - Go after me.

232
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,660
Look at you. You are no good at running, nor can you ride a bike.

233
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,680
I can't ride a bike, but I have you.

234
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,870
Ji Chen, can you exert some strength?

235
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,480
You can do it!

236
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,620

237
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,180

238
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,260
Brother Hao, have you seen those cartoons

239
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,530
Gigi draws on the blackboard at the door of the café?

240
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,960
And she posted them on social media.

241
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
They became popular on the Internet.

242
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,930
Many guests in our café came to take photos.

243
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,650
I have seen them.

244
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,940
But I have a feeling that the cartoons she drew weren't in a good mood.

245
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,290
They are always something like farewell, appreciation, or something.

246
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,460
Is she planning to resign? What do you think?

247
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,910
Is she? Didn't she just say that she rejected the producer?

248
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,260
- Where else can she go? 
 - Who knows.

249
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,970
Brother Hao, I'm just checking.

250
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,280
If she's really going to resign, will you keep her or not?

251
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,850
I won't think about it before it really comes.

252
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,780

253
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,980

254
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,970
You have recovered. It's time to go home.

255
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,340
I don't want to go home.

256
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,050
Why do you want to stay at my house?

257
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,500
You're my girlfriend.

258
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,470
I'm having a relationship with you, not a marriage.

259
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,480
Go home. Stay in your big villa.

260
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,170
Go.

261
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,160
Good boy. Go home. Go.

262
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,650
Go.

263
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,790
Fine, then.

264
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,170
What's up?

265
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,170
One more kiss here.

266
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,160
What's wrong again?

267
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,600
Send me home.

268
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,210
But in most situations, it's a man sending a woman back.

269
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,180
I can send you back again.

270
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,260
Fine, let's go. I'll walk you to the door.

271
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,990
I'm leaving.

272
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,860
- See you. 
 - See you.

273
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,550
Why don't you go upstairs?

274
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,870
I want to watch you leave.

275
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,400
I'll watch you leave.

276
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,040
You go first.

277
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,210
- You go first. 
 - You go first.

278
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,840
- You go first. 
 - You go first.

279
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,380
Enough, you go.

280
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,430
No.

281
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,300
Me neither. Go ahead.

282
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,850
You go ahead.

283
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,280
You go ahead.

284
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,140
I told you, you go first.

285
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,080
- I want to watch you leave. Go.
- Enough.

286
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,690
Since it's hard to separate each other,

287
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,430
just stay here tonight.

288
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,310
I-I'm leaving.

289
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,760

290
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,580
Me too.

291
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,130
 Tian Tian, don't just eat junk food.  
  {Chen]

292
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,130
 Have a cup of yogurt if you feel hungry at night.

293
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,760
 It's good for intestinal motility.

294
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,300
 This is your favorite music.

295
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,390
 Hope you can have a good dream every night,

296
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,620
 and your life is full of love.

297
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,280
Honey, thank you for your food and music.

298
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,070
 My life is full of love

299
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,070
 with you be my side.

300
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,470
 Time to sleep.

301
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,890
 Good night. Sweet dream.

302
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,280
 Morning, Tian Tian.

303
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,990
 I have washed and dressed up.

304
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,610
 Go to work refreshingly!

305
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,070
Good morning, Tian Tian.

306
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,140
What are you doing?

307
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,970
I'm looking if there are acquaintances nearby.

308
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,880
It's not good to go to work in my boss' car.

309
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,090
Where is your boss? This is your boyfriend's car.

310
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,660
Get on.

311
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,090
Start up.

312
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,510
What are you waiting for?

313
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,420
I'm asking you to start me up!

314
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,260
Or I can't start the car.

315
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,350
Seat belt.

316
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,240
Let's go.

317
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,720
Stop here.

318
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,520
I'll get off here.

319
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,370
Why?

320
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,880
It's not good if our colleagues see me get off your car.

321
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,520
It's not your first time taking my car.

322
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,850
It's different.

323
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,980
We were pure boss and employee then.

324
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,080
What about now?

325
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,870
Now? We'd better avoid arousing suspicion.

326
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,770
It's no big deal.

327
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:17,180
Why don't we admit it and let everyone know we are dating?

328
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,510
But I don't think it's a perfect time to publicize our relationship now.

329
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,310
Why?

330
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,960
Office romances are not advocated in Xing Yi.

331
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,750
Is it true? I never heard about that.

332
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,910
It's against human nature.

333
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,920
I'll tell the HR Department to remove the rule,

334
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,410
and encourage our employees to date someone else in the company

335
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,050
provided they do their jobs well.

336
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,110
It's not my biggest concern.

337
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,600
After my hard work, it won't take me

338
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,140
a long time to fulfill my dream of entering the Sports Division Department.

339
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,270
It's an undoubtedly logical thing.

340
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,620
But if they know our relationship ahead of time,

341
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,010
the whole story will get twisted.

342
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,590
I can't stop the rumors.

343
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,630
But I have the final say of their lives.

344
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,370
That's the point.

345
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,430
We are romantically involved now,

346
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,890
and I need to prove myself with my own strength.

347
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,290
Never expected my girl to be such a career girl.

348
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,560
Good, I support you.

349
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,270
The quarterly performance appraisal is around the corner.

350
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,380
If you could finish the target,

351
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,400
I'll transfer you to the Sports Division Department fairly.

352
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,140
Sounds weird.

353
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,700
However, even though I go to another department,

354
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,120
I still can't get away with your claws.

355
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,190
Claws?

356
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,760
I'll show you the real power of my claws!

357
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,160
Tell me that again when you catch up with the champion of the race.

358
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,150
See you later.

359
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,010
Hello.

360
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,730
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

361
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,260
Hello.

362
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,670
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

363
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,550
Morning.

364
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,220
You're all here.

365
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,980
Good morning, President Ji.

366
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,130
How's it? My speed from the underground to the elevator

367
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,780
didn't lose to the champion of the race, right?

368
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,650
Come on.

369
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,220
You are not going upstairs?

370
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,430
We are.

371
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,720
Don't you take the elevator?

372
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,440
We are.

373
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,470
Why don't you come in?

374
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,770
You may go upstairs first. It's too crowded.

375
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,500
Look, they don't dare to take the elevator with us now.

376
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,610
So I make three rules with you from now on.

377
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,360
First, no intimate actions in the company.

378
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,080
Second, keep our relationship from everyone else.

379
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,350
Third, business is business. Don't treat me with private emotion.

380
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,270
Okay, I promise you. You are the boss.

381
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,840
If you break the rules, we're over.

382
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Once out of the elevator, our relationship is boss-employee. We will get on our own ways.

383
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,840
But we are still a couple now.

384
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,240
- What a coincidence. 
 - The elevator is a bit crowded. How about we take the next one?

385
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,480
- All right. 
 - Okay. 
 -No. It's all right.

386
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,760
Come in, please.

387
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,070
Come in.

388
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,430
Yes.

389
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,550
President Ji.

390
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:40,050

391
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:46,211
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

392
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:50,271
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

393
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:54,871
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

394
00:38:54,871 --> 00:39:00,541
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

395
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:05,301
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

396
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,064
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

397
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:13,601
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

398
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,830
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

399
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:23,641
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

400
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:27,041
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

401
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,541
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

402
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:36,406
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

408
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,603
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

409
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:10,144
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

410
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:20,041
