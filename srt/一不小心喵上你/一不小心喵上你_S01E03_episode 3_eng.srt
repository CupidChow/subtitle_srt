1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,100
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,230
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,260
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,330
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,690
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,920

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,800

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,580
You naughty boy, are you running away from home again?

19
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,400
You're so like Nian Nian.

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Your owner must be as worried as I am.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
You seem to know this place.

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,380
Did you live here before I came?

23
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,380
You are finally back, Miss.

24
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,460
Your cat is out here again. That young man took it back again.

25
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm sorry for the trouble, Sir.

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,620
Here.

27
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,060
What is it?

28
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,880
Please hold her for a second.

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
 It came to my place again.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,320
 I think it knows my place very well.

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,460
 It must have come here often.

32
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,360
 Perhaps, this is fate.

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,900
 If you don't mind,

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,380
 I am happy to take care of it anytime.

35
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,180
 By the way, I gave it a location collar, just in case.

36
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,800
You naughty little thing.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,040
I can't believe you met the same nice guy twice.

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,260
You are lucky.

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,740
You must keep an eye on it.

40
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,980
- It's a busy street. It might get hurt, you know? 
 - Okay.t

41
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,520
- Thanks. 
 - It's all right.

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's go home now. Or, I may have to stay up all night.

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,460
Come on.

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,540

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,860
It's finally done.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,980
I wonder if you could actually get up at 5 in the morning.

47
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,500
You are absolutely giving me a hard time.

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,840
I, Zhou Tian, will remember this.

49
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,580
I'm telling you.

50
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,580
From today, we are enemies.

51
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
 President Ji is waiting for you on voice call.

52
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,240
What is he? A devil?

53
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,200
He must live by Australian Time.

54
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,720
You will find my feedback in your email box.

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,780
Revise and resend it to me before work.

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Oh, my God.

57
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,040
- Hello. 
  - President Ji.Tina, the brand director of EX, is about to return early.

58
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,940
 Her assistant called and told me she will meet you next time.

59
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,880
What am I going to do with those dark circles?

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,220
So this is how you get out?

61
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,560
Looks like I need to put a lock on this.

62
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,900
Fine.

63
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,220
But you have to promise me that you won't run away, and you will return for me regularly.

64
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,920
Then, I'll let you out, All right?

65
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
Wait.

66
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 Hi, Mr. Nice.

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,480
 My name is Zhou Tian.

68
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,260
 Thank you for taking care of my cat twice.

69
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,780
 Her name is Qiu Qiu, and she's been spayed already.

70
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,680
 She's a girl.

71
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
 You were right.

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 I should give her some free time.

73
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,400
 I live in Building No. 6, Third Xinxiu Village.

74
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,620
 Can you tell me your name and address?

75
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,100
 I'd like to thank you in person with Qiu Qiu.

76
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,420

77
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,700

78
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,020

79
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,960
 Hi, Mr. Nice.

80
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,440
 My name is Zhou Tian.

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,640
 I live in Building No. 6, Third Xinxiu Village.

82
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,620
 Can you tell me your name and address?

83
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,320
Perhaps it's imprudent of me

84
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,280
to ask for his personal information.

85
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,100
And, it's rude to ask for his address directly.

86
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,400
 Thank you for taking Qiu Qiu in and caring her.

87
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,520
 Before I met her, she was a stray cat.

88
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,580
 That's probably why she likes to be free.

89
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,580
 Anyway, I decide to respect her

90
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,440
 and make her a free-range cat.

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
 Please add me on your WeChat.

92
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,360
 I'll pay for her collar.

93
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
 My WeChat ID, Sunday.

94
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,160
 P.S. Welcome to being keeper No. 2 of Qiu Qiu.

95
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,580

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,020
What happened to you, Zhou Tian?

97
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,340
Don't get me started.

98
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,020
President Ji made me stay up all night.

99
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,020
I submitted the report at 5 a.m.,

100
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,000
but he made me revise it over and over.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,760
I only had two hours of sleep.

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
I have to go now.

103
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,780
I have to report to President Ji now.

104
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,280
Qiao Yi will leave at this time in the morning.

105
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,340
Then, you will take him to meet this man.

106
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,340
Next, head for Building B at 16:30  (2:30 p.m.) . This is Building B.

107
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,860
He will have dinner at Building C.

108
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,040
- Don't forget that. 
 - President Ji, I've confirmed with Tina's assistant.

109
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,940
Tina will make time and see you before leaving the hotel. You will meet her in the hotel lobby.

110
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,260
She's about to check out in an hour.

111
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,900
It's quite urgent. We have to make it there within 30 minutes.

112
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,000
Tell my driver to wait for me downstairs. We'll leave in a minute.

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,680
All our actors and actresses are out today, and so are all the drivers.

114
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,060
So, I'll drive you there.

115
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,620
You? Can you make it there before dark?

116
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,140
But you have a video conference in 10 minutes.

117
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,980
You can't be in the meeting and drive at the same time.

118
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,860
President Ji, please let me drive you.

119
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,820
I'll go fast, 30 miles per hour.

120
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,140
No, 40 miles per hour.

121
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,840
Do you drive?

122
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,940
Do you drive often?

123
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,060
Rest assured. I'm the best driver in the racing game.

124
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,240
 Ready? Go!

125
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,820

126
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,880
President Ji, this car is amazing.

127
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,660
Hi, President Chen.

128
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,560
 I heard things didn't go well with Tina.

129
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,060
- No. 
  - Ji Chen,

130
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,480
 I know you are young, ambitious,

131
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,680
 confident, and pushy.

132
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,140
 It is good.

133
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,720
 However...

134
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,880
 Is there a problem?

135
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,500
Please continue, President Chen.

136
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,480
 What I'm saying is that

137
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,580
 you young people must be...

138
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm sorry, President Ji.

139
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,140
I had no idea you had carsickness.

140
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,100
I don't get carsick,

141
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,760
but I do get sick of you.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,980
- Tina. 
 - President Ji. 
 - I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

143
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,380
It's all right.

144
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,240
I didn't think you could make it

145
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,540
with the traffic at this hour.

146
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,840
Tina, I know you only have 20 minutes before leaving for the airport.

147
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,740
So I'll just get to the point.

148
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,600
I heard that EX is looking for a regional endorser.

149
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,200
I hope you can consider Qiao Yi.

150
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,620
Qiao Yi?

151
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,880
His readers seem to be mostly young,

152
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,480
which is inconsistent with our concept.

153
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
We have analyzed Qiao Yi's readership,

154
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,320
and here is the readership constitution we concluded.

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,260
Please have a look.

156
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,360
A young writer like him does have a certain readership age of under 18, especially teenagers.

157
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,040
But, what makes Qiao Yi special

158
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,820
is that his novels also have great influences

159
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,720
on people between 25 and 35.

160
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,500
Take a look at this.

161
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,220
These are Qiao Yi's collections of works.

162
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,280
And here is the chart of his reader groups on Tencent Reading and iReader.

163
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,060
Those people are characterized by high income, high education,

164
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,240
and good consumption ability.

165
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,340
 Isn't that the report I stayed up last night to complete?

166
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,060
 He wasn't mean to spite me.

167
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,440
 Those materials really matter.

168
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,220
Please have a look at this.

169
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,300

170
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,260
This is a professional app for re-creation of existing novels.

171
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,900
We made a statistical analysis of the top 100 novels in re-creation.

172
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,180
Do you know how many people

173
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,820
used characters and settings from Qiao Yi's novels to create their own novel.

174
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Forty percent of them did.

175
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,100
While only a small portion of people used other novels'.

176
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,800
This means that Qiao Yi's novels are quite popular among readers.

177
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,300
At present, young people are becoming a major force in the domestic consumer market.

178
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,800
I know you are also trying it out now.

179
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
For instance, your clothes jointly designed with other trendy designers

180
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,160
are targeted at young people.

181
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,700
Therefore, I think Qiao Yi is your guy.

182
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,000
You did your homework, President Ji.

183
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,320
You know what. Regarding the jointly-designed series,

184
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,480
we will have a dinner party in a few days.

185
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
It's somewhat of a nonprofit nature.

186
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,100
I can invite Qiao Yi to attend as a guest.

187
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,460
I can also introduce our boss to you.

188
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,480
We'll also see

189
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
if Qiao Yi is the right person for our brand.

190
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,320
Thank you. We're honored.

191
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,980
I met a lot of talent managers during this business trip.

192
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,320
Only you made a persuasive statement.

193
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,340
Qiao Yi is lucky to have you as his talent agent.

194
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm looking forward to cooperating with you.

195
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,440
Xin Xin.

196
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,820
Our boss doesn't come here often, right?

197
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,840
I haven't seen him since I got here.

198
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,100
No, he comes here a lot.

199
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,500
There is a lounge for him upstairs.

200
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,240
However, he's gone to training recently.

201
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,260
That's why you haven't seen him.

202
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,920
I think he'll come back today.

203
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,440
So I get to see him today?

204
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,100
You are awfully excited to see him.

205
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,080
What's your angle?

206
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,220
Nope. I have no angle.

207
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,680
Tian Tian told me that

208
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,440
our boss would decide if I get to stay here.

209
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,980
Don't worry. Tian Tian was only saying that.

210
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,840
Our boss won't say no to you as long as she decides to hire you.

211
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,100
Who is Tian Tian to our boss?

212
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,480
She's a close friend of his.

213
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,860

214
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Excuse me. I have to take this.

215
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,560
Boss?

216
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,900
Good heavens, I'm so glad you are back.

217
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,540
You have no idea how bad business was

218
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,440
when you were gone.

219
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm looking forward to cooperating with you.

220
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,800
How many times do I have to tell you?

221
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,060
I'm not the boss. Zhou Tian is.

222
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,960
She wanted to have this cat coffee shop.

223
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,760
That's why we could have this Kitties' Fairyland.

224
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,560
But Tian Tian is gone to work for someone else now.

225
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,760
She's gone now,

226
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,100
but she will come back later.

227
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,000
How do you know?

228
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,220
Think about it.

229
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,000
She can make her own decisions and do whatever she wants here.

230
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,440
While in another company, she has to obey and please someone.

231
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,060
Which one would you choose if you were her?

232
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,860
You do have a point.

233
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,660
One can only know what one wants after one tries other options.

234
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,780
Nevertheless, being in charge is certainly more appealing.

235
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,420
 Calm down, Ji Nian.

236
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,220
 It's time to show what you got!

237
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,500
Oh my, spider!

238
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,100
Is it dead?

239
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,440
Yes, it's dead.

240
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,020
That was scary.

241
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
What a great body you got here.

242
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,400
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

243
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Sorry.

244
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,860
Oh, I almost forgot. You don't know each other yet.

245
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,140
She's Gigi, a new employee. You don't know each other yet.

246
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,220
She studied abroad.

247
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,820
I'm 22 years old and a Sagittarius.

248
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,320
He is our boss,

249
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,660
Zhang Hao, a master of cross-country races.

250
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,500
He was the grand slam contestant in Level S competition.

251
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,060
Hi.

252
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,340
Hi, Zhang Hao.

253
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm a little tired. So I'm gonna go upstairs and rest.

254
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,880
All right, go ahead.

255
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
No worries. We'll take care of the business.

256
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,560
Rest assured, Brother Zhang Hao.

257
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,540
Brother Zhang Hao.

258
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,440
I didn't expect you to be slick.

259
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,040
Stop it. Get to work, will you?

260
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,420
Clean the dead spider first.

261
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,080
Fine.

262
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,660

263
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,000

264
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,200
 I want this in an hour. I want this in two hours.

265
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,420
 I want these two in three hours. I want this one in four hours.

266
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,560
 I need this by 1 a.m. This, by 2 a.m.

267
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,880
 This, 3 a.m. This, 4 a.m. These two, by 7 a.m.

268
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,300
 Anyway, I want them all by 12 p.m.

269
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,040
What the hell was that?

270
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,760
How did I fall asleep?

271
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,700

272
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,420

273
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820

274
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,900

275
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,740

276
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,910

277
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,980

278
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,340
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

279
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,900
How much is the collar?

280
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,180
It's all right. Consider it my gift to Qiu Qiu.

281
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,420
All right, then. On behalf of Qiu Qiu, I thank you, keeper No. 2.

282
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,140
By the way, do you mind if Qiu Qiu stays with me for a couple of more days?

283
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,600
No, not at all.

284
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,880
I happen to have a new job lately.

285
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,900
I'm so exhausted that I began to doubt my choice.

286
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,760
And I don't have time for her.

287
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,280
Work is important, but your health is more important.

288
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,840
You must take care.

289
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,580
Don't worry. I'm not that delicate.

290
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,780
I'll fight the dark force to the end!

291
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,360
You sound like a righteous person.

292
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Are you a policewoman?

293
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,520
No, I'm not a policewoman.

294
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,880
By dark force, I mean

295
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,100
a

296
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,120
stinky crocodile.

297
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,810
In my dream, President Ji did look like

298
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,200
a ferocious and violent crocodile.

299
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,700
A crocodile? Are you working at a zoo?

300
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,060

301
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,680
Zoo? That's one way to put it.

302
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,580
Sort of.

303
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,960
You have no idea how miserable I am.

304
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,580
I was supposed to take care of a self-conceited peacock.

305
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,500
However, I got transferred to a crocodile pond.

306
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,100
That crocodile is so scheming and mean.

307
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,580
So tyrannic and unreasonable.

308
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,200
It's a crocodile, anyway.

309
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,240
We, humans, are superior beings.

310
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,040
Don't lower yourself to argue with a cold-blooded animal.

311
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,220
If necessary, you can develop some incentives and punishments for it.

312
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,600
You seem to know this stuff a lot.

313
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,480
Are you an animal trainer?

314
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,660

315
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,320
 No, not really.

316
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,160
Occasionally, I have to train some huskies.

317
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,400
I've got it.

318
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,600
You must be a pet trainer, specializing in training huskies.

319
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,900
Huskies are cute.

320
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,140
Your job must be fun.

321
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,290
I'm not sure if it's cute,

322
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,020
but it does surprise me a lot when it makes trouble.

323
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,560
That's typical husky.

324
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I believe you can train it eventually.

325
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500

326
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,620

327
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,020

328
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,280
Brother Yi, take a look at the procedure and the guest list for tonight's conference.

329
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,260
Let me see.

330
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,820
There are three writers here, and I'm the last to go out there.

331
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,960
President Ji got this opportunity for you.

332
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,720
Are you speaking up for him?

333
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,100
Did you suffer from Stockholm syndrome?

334
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,850
Business is business.

335
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,390
I don't like his personality,

336
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,500
but I have to admit that he excels at what he does.

337
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,900
Perhaps I should thank you for thinking so highly of me.

338
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,200
You're welcome.

339
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,440
President Ji.

340
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,340
Where is the bow tie?

341
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,160
There is no bow tie?

342
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,100
I don't know. Our client provided this outfit.

343
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,860
Perhaps they missed it?

344
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,260
I checked everything when picking it up.

345
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,380
Then, I gave it to you.

346
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,020
What are you implying?

347
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,220
Are you saying that I lost the bow tie?

348
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
- No, I didn't say that. 
 - What are you implying then?

349
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,080
We should focus on solving the problem, instead of blaming each other.

350
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,140
I'll ask our client to bring another one over.

351
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,980
This series of clothes are specially made of eco-friendly materials.

352
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,280
They coincide perfectly with the conference theme tonight and even with the theme of my new book.

353
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,340
And the bow tie is entirely made of plastic waste. It's the essence of the whole outfit.

354
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,740
I heard that it's extremely hard and time-consuming to produce a bow tie like that.

355
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,860
So, you have to go without the bow tie.

356
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,020
Without it?

357
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,420
If he doesn't wear it, we may get reproached by our client and be ridiculed by the public.

358
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,100
Just say something useful, all right?

359
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,280
I have an idea.

360
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,640
The theme of the series is the environment.

361
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,000
The designer also stressed the application of natural materials.

362
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,280
As for the dyeing, she used the ancient dyeing technique.

363
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,740
This got me thinking that perhaps we should focus on the theme, which is the environment.

364
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,240
Environment?

365
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,600
You are just saying that.

366
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,680
Do you have a specific plan?

367
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,080
Perhaps we could make a bow tie out of this?

368
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,510

369
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,780
All right, Qiao Yi. Please stay for a moment.

370
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,220
Qiao Yi, I saw your bow tie from afar, and I think it's pretty special.

371
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,860
But it doesn't seem to be the original bow tie of this outfit.

372
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,020
It's made of leaves, right?

373
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,080
Yes.

374
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,320
Are they real leaves or preserved flowers that kind of thing?

375
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,800
It's made of real leaves. You can touch it if you don't believe me.

376
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,940
These are real leaves!

377
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,880
How creative.

378
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,900
But as far as I know, EX had prepared outfits for all guests today.

379
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:51,140
And it's widely known that EX respects its designers a lot.

380
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,330
Don't you think EX may take it as an offense

381
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,680
if you change their original design?

382
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,040
I don't think you have read the brochure for the conference carefully.

383
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,280
You must bear in mind what I'm about to say.

384
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:17,020
- The... 
  - EX and Ms. Amanda, the trendy designer,

385
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,920
 have jointly proposed the concept of changing the aesthetics of clothes.

386
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,800
EX and Ms. Amanda, the trendy designer,

387
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,020
have jointly proposed the concept of changing the aesthetics of clothes.

388
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,100
 Her design of the entire series has shown her respect for tradition and nature.

389
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,120
Her design of the entire series has shown her respect for tradition and nature.

390
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,320
 All the cloths are dyed with dyestuff made of plants, which is the oldest dyeing technique.

391
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,920
All the cloths are dyed with dyestuff made of plants, which is the oldest dyeing technique.

392
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,500
She demonstrated her idea of environmental protection.

393
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,400
 Not just saying those words.

394
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,880
By actually doing something.

395
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,600
 She started small and integrated eco-friendly materials with traditional clothes.

396
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,520
To gradually influence people and promote the pro-environmental idea.

397
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,200
 I think...

398
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,120
This is the true spirit behind this conference.

399
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,440
I wanted to echo her design concept.

400
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
That's why I changed a little.

401
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,580
I'm not a professional designer.

402
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,000
So my bow tie may not be fine.

403
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,140
But I want to make an effort to show my support for environmental protection.

404
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,440
I also urge you all to cut down on expensive furs

405
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,400
and use more natural materials.

406
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,140
Well said!

407
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,600
Let's give him a round of applause.

408
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,160
Thank you. Thank you for the speech, Qiao Yi.

409
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,660
This way, please.

410
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,220
President Ji, the president of the EX came to Qiao Yi and told him

411
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,340
that he was a great embodiment of the brand concept.

412
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,040
Does it mean Qiao Yi is more likely to get the job and be EX's endorser?

413
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,680
I must make sure he is.

414
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,140
I'll slow down today.

415
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,060
President Ji, if you no longer need me here, I'll go home now.

416
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,500
It's time for me to get off work.

417
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,740
I told you before that we as talent mangers must be on standby 24/7.

418
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,840
But the news conference is over, and Qiao Yi also left.

419
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,760
Why do we have to work overtime?

420
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
Get in the car.

421
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,800
Come on. Eat some.

422
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,640
Time to eat.

423
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,000
 Enough is enough! Don't try to call me again!

424
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,700
 So what?

425
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,040
 Just leave me alone! Or you'll be sorry!

426
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,420

427
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,180
Well, looks like I'm done here.

428
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,240
Brother Zhang Hao, I'll get going.

429
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
All right.

430
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,120
 Is she in trouble?

431
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,200
It's me, Zhang Hao.

432
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,480
Brother Zhang Hao?

433
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,260
Are you all right?

434
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,440
Brother Zhang Hao, why are you...

435
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
I heard what you said over the phone at the shop.

436
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,740
I was worried you might get hurt on your way home.

437
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,080
But I couldn't bring myself to ask you directly.

438
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,700
That's why you are here in secret to protect me?

439
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,140
But it seemed I did a bad thing. I frightened you.

440
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,570
No, you didn't.

441
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,380
I'm deeply touched and also surprised.

442
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,560
Perhaps you can tell me what kind of trouble you are in.

443
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
It's all right. No pressure.

444
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,240
You don't have to.

445
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,700
But if you do need me, I'll always be there for you.

446
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,380
Come on. Let me walk you home.

447
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,040
All right.

448
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,860
Let's go.

449
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,560
What's new?

450
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,680
President Ji. All the feedback we got are favorable.

451
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,460
Qiao Yi's leaf bow tie was also praised by Ms. Amanda.

452
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,180
She personally sent an email to express her appreciation

453
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,280
for Qiao Yi's change of bow tie and his support for environmental protection.

454
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,820
That bow tie idea was brilliant!

455
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,440
Follow up on this.

456
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,080
- Use this data. 
 - Okay.

457
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,500
Hey, Xiao Xia.

458
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,740
Now that the conference is over, can we contact the client?

459
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,040
Did our client give any feedback?

460
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,960
Don't you know it's a tough business?

461
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,850
We must be productive and efficient at Xing Yi.

462
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,650
But now, we lost the original bow tie,

463
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,520
- which could be a huge hazard for us. 
 - Seriously?

464
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,140
- Yes. President Ji will win this client for sure.  
 - Oh, okay.

465
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,200
Let's hurry up and prepare the documents.

466
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,020

467
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,220
 This could be a problem. You should check it again.

468
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,380

469
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,360
Kevin, come in.

470
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,140
President Ji, here is your ginseng tea.

471
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,260
The temperature is just right, 46.5℃  (115.7°F).

472
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,560
President Ji, it was brilliant of you

473
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,680
to think of eco bow tie and promote the theme based on that.

474
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,480
It was Zhou Tian.

475
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,016
I mean the eco bow tie. It's her idea.

476
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:46,676
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

477
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:50,636
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

478
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:55,216
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

479
00:38:55,216 --> 00:39:01,046
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

480
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:05,706
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

481
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:09,194
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

482
00:39:09,194 --> 00:39:14,011
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

483
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:17,916
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

484
00:39:19,346 --> 00:39:23,976
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

485
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:27,416
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

486
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:32,216
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

487
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:37,511
