1
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:13,080

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,250

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,830
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,830
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,530
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,490
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,800

18
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,560
Kevin, come in.

19
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,440
President Ji, here is your ginseng tea.

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,460
46.5℃  (115.7°F).

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,160
President Ji, it was brilliant of you to think of eco bow tie

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,080
and promote the theme based on that.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,780
It was Zhou Tian.

24
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,440
I mean the eco bow tie. It's her idea.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,660
The collar is not the point.

26
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,180
Qiao Yi's speech is very powerful.

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,000
President Ji, you must be a genius.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Last night, some independent designers spoke for Qiao Yi online.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,100
They supported him.

30
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,160
They also expected to cooperate with Qiao Yi since he respects design and nature.

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Genius.

32
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Hello, Tina.

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,320
All right. No problem.

34
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,160
Is it settled?

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,620
Yes, basically.

36
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,960
Great.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
If he gets this endorsement,

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,220
he won't consider terminating the contract or causing any other trouble.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,320
He actually recruited Zhou Tian, a rookie,

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,160
trying to trouble you.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,420
How dare he?

42
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,200
However, everything is under your control.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,500
His scheme will never work.

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,320
You don't have any work?

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,600
I do.

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,380
I'll go meet the attorney and the accountant to follow up on the future contract.

47
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,060
Can't believe she left alone.

48
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Hi, President Ji.

49
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,420
Morning.

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,280
Do you want some breakfast?

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,640
It's 7 a.m. now. Two hours later, we'll start working.

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,720
Instead of taking some rest, you chose to order food?

53
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,120
I didn't order. It's too early now.

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
I went out and bought these.

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,700
I know nothing about this.

56
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,260
And I didn't help much.

57
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,200
So I thought I could prepare some food.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
When they wake up, they have to start working.

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,860
Now they don't have to work hungry.

60
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,880
I thought you were organizing Qiao Yi's work plan?

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,460
That's an easy chore.

62
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,280
I watched them contact various parties and brands

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,920
to discuss the promotion plan and feed data back all night.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,160
I realized that this is not an easy job.

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,060
A whole process system behind the scene.

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,940
Behind every celebrity, it's a team.

67
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,260
Only by cooperating efficiently and working harder than others

68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,480
can this celebrity go further.

69
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,800
All right. I understand now.

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,960
I will study really hard.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,460
I'll go ask them to have some food.

72
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,360
If Qiao Yi can successfully win the endorsement of EX,

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,940
it'll be the first cooperation between Xing Yi and EX.

74
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,480
President Ji is so amazing.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,860
Why?

76
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,740
Qiao Yi presented in the fashion world before,

77
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,300
but he never officially endorsed anything.

78
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,520
Lucy didn't pay much attention to it.

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,040
She would simply accept which paid more.

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,200
So, Qiao Yi's commercial resource has always been poor.

81
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,760
And it has a negative impact on him.

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,740
It must be hard for him.

83
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,780
I did gather some of information for the job interview.

84
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,200
He is a good writer and is known to the public to use his royalty income for charity work.

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,260
Yes. That's why I said President Ji is amazing.

86
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,040
I heard a lot of companies are contacting EX.

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,460
President Ji ingeniously settled the dispute

88
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,000
and made Qiao Yi stand out.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,740
He's indeed a pro.

90
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,700
And it is said that once this endorsement is settled,

91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,820
we will be half achieved on this year's performance.

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,060
- Morning, President Ji. 
 - Morning, President Ji.

93
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,300
President Ji, morning.

94
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,680
Zhou Tian, come.

95
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,980
Qiao Yi's schedule has changed. Cancel his vacation next month.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,260
Is the EX thing settled?

97
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,980
Only need a stamp now. It'll be announced next week.

98
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,480
Qiao Yi is the first Asian endorser of EX.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,260
President Ji, you'll be the man who makes history.

100
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,600
I'll deliver the good news to him.

101
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,150

102
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,000
No answer. He may be busy.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll text him on WeChat.

104
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,740
Red alert, President Ji.

105
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,460
Someone charges Qiao Yi with plagiarism before his book is published.

106
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,680
Indeed the ace of Xing Yi.

107
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,920
So many paparazzi here.

108
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,380
Don't move.

109
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,780
They know me.

110
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,900
We'll be under siege if we get out now.

111
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,240
Seriously?

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,940
You're a boss, not a celebrity.

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm a celebrity's talent manager.

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,780
We'll use underground parking.

115
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,860
President Ji, why do you have Qiao Yi's key card?

116
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,940
If you can't enter your celebrity's house,

117
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,360
maybe you need to reflect on how terrible a talent manager you are.

118
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,040
 I was just asking.

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
 He's such a prude.

120
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,340
President Ji, I don't think we should enter his house when he's not home.

121
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,760
For his safety during critical periods, we have to.

122
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,820
 But how we do it matters a lot.

123
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,600
 Crocodile is so scary.

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,780
Relax.

125
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,500
I have no interest in your privacy.

126
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,680
 He can't be reading my mind just now?

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,020
No one's home.

128
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,460
Is he...

129
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,140
I think he's taking a shower.

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,180
President Ji, where are you going?

131
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,640
When he takes a shower, it'll cost at least one hour.

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
One hour?

133
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,240
Isn't it too much for his skin?

134
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,580
But isn't it rude if we break into his bathroom?

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,080
What are you doing?

136
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,460
If you don't want to give up your writing career,

137
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,340
come out in five minutes.

138
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,480
Qiao Yi, you said you wrote every word... in your book yourself.

139
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,700
Why are you charged with plagiarism?

140
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,020
I don't know!

141
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,820
I promise I wrote every word in the new book myself,

142
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,980
or I'll be struck by lightning.

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,800
Hello, Kevin.

144
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,020
Tell PR Department to prepare a short statement.

145
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,560
Deny plagiarism and claim that we retain the right to legal recourse.

146
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,600
But I can't promise my old books.

147
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,680
Kevin, suspend it.

148
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,020
It's not plagiarism, I guess.

149
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,400
When I was looking for materials,

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,520
Lucy got me some.

151
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,980
I thought those were good.

152
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,660
She said we bought the copyright.

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,420
 How did they know Qiao Yi's address?

154
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,200
 Maybe it's because of the delivery guy?

155
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,280
Can't you just post a statement to clarify?

156
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,540
We need to find the copyright contract first.

157
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,960
The statement only will make it worse.

158
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll have someone find the contract.

159
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,240
We have to get out of here now.

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
Let's figure it out later.

161
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,080
How? The house is surrounded.

162
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,360
I have an idea.

163
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,720
Hello, Kevin.

164
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,560
Drive a quiet car to Qiao Yi's home.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,740
 Take my spare car key and drive my car away to distract those people.

166
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,200
He's coming!

167
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,400
Let me.

168
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,630

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
- Done. 
  - Easy, please.

170
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,740
 It hurts.

171
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,440

172
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,240
What? Are you murdering me?

173
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,460
Today is rough enough for me.

174
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,720
President Ji.

175
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,660

176
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,540
Speak.

177
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,800
President Ji.

178
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,280
I just asked Legal Department to go through all the contracts related to Qiao Yi in the past few years.

179
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
You're right.

180
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,760
It must be me who accidentally gave away Qiao Yi's address.

181
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,940
As you expected, there is no licensing contract related to the new book at all.

182
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,200
Days ago, I gave the delivery guy his address.

183
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,040
And now, they all found him.

184
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,460
It can't be a simple coincidence.

185
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,160
I made a terrible mistake, right?

186
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,680
I feel I did wrong to Qiao Yi.

187
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,500
We have not found any contracts.

188
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm the one who screwed this up.

189
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,040
About the person exposed this time nor the other three cases Qiao Yi mentioned.

190
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,140
President Ji, should we call the police now?

191
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,340
President Ji, what should we do next?

192
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,120
The plagiarism thing is really creepy.

193
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,040
The book is not even published.

194
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,100
Why did that person step out now?

195
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,860
This is not the right timing.

196
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,080
President Ji, what do you think?

197
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,020
- Hello? 
 - What are you? A book full of questions?

198
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,760
Why can't you stop asking?

199
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,860
Sorry. It's my fault.

200
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,100
I can accept it if you want to fire me.

201
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,520
Firing you won't help any little.

202
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,880
Keeping you may help. Even trash can be useful.

203
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
Shut up now.

204
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,540
Or get out and run back home.

205
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,000
President Ji?

206
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,680
 So moody.

207
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
 It was you who started the talk.

208
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,740

209
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,860
No spare tire, and no signal.

210
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,380
What are you doing?

211
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,840
You said it. I should run back home.

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,160
Well, it's my duty to obey your order if I want to be a good employee.

213
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,680
Also, running 10 kilometers at night,

214
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,260
just a piece of cake.

215
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,980
Bye, then.

216
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,140
Should I consider running back home just like her?

217
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,120

218
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,480
Aren't you overjoyed with the plot reverse?

219
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,160
No?

220
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,420
You didn't feel it?

221
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,900
Just now, I left alone.

222
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,960
And you were left alone. This is basically nowhere.

223
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Didn't you feel a little lonely or scared?

224
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,920
I was thinking if I should fire you,

225
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,180
an employee who ran away when meeting trouble.

226
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,500
I won't run away.

227
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,420
I love my job so much.

228
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,900
As an employee, I definitely care about your safety. Right?

229
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,620
How can I leave you in the middle of nowhere alone?

230
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,840
I just went to get us a helper.

231
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,660
President Ji, the tow truck is here.

232
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,780

233
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,800
Qiu Qiu, do you know that?

234
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm so tired today.

235
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,720
 Is Qiu Qiu back home?

236
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,140
 Yup.

237
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,980
Good to hear that.

238
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,140
You just returned from work?

239
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,660
Yes. I've been working overtime recently.

240
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,720
I can't even see any stars when I'm back home.

241
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,200
- Stars? 
 - Yes.

242
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,540
They are always in the sky, aren't they?

243
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,980
I'm not talking about stars in the sky.

244
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,720
The air quality in the city is so poor now.

245
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,400
You can't really see more than five stars.

246
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
And you have to find them.

247
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,560
I'm trying to relax, not spot the difference.

248
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,660
So what kind of star?

249
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,580
Light in every window.

250
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,520
I noticed that the city lights look like the starry sky

251
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,240
when I stand upside down.

252
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,480
So dreamy and so healing.

253
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
My troubles, no matter how big it is, all vanish at that moment.

254
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,940
Seems you got great pressure from work.

255
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,900
Exactly. You really sound like a fortuneteller.

256
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,920
Is it the peacock or the crocodile giving you a hard time?

257
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,280
Long story.

258
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,520
In a word, the peacock meets the crocodile,

259
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,740
and everything just got tougher.

260
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,380
Got it. All right. Take a rest.

261
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,780
Store up some energy. And fight them tomorrow.

262
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,580
Nothing can't be fixed in this world.

263
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,230
You just need to find the right way to do it.

264
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,600
I'll take your word for it.

265
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,660
Thank you, 1003.

266
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,980

267
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,480
President Ji, I've sent all event-related comments to your email box.

268
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,020
 Qiao Yi's matter has led to a lively debate online.

269
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,700
 There are many who defend Qiao Yi

270
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,600
 and call on netizens to keep calm until the truth comes out.

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,840
 Yet most are just well-wishers.

272
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,120
 Nothing useful has been found so far.

273
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,980
 Are we at a dead end now?

274
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,960
This Li Xiang chose to speak now, declined all visitors,

275
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,660
and tried to go abroad temporarily.

276
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,160
This is so weird.

277
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,640
Wait. I have to find a way to reach this person.

278
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Make it clear face-to-face.

279
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,080
Time to get off?

280
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,900
Get off? Wake up, Miss.

281
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,640
It's morning now.

282
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,340
Come on. Have some coffee.

283
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,540
Let's continue working.

284
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,100
We worked overnight for Qiao Yi,

285
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,440
and now we have to continue?

286
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,300
President Ji is so ruth...

287
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,720
Voice down.

288
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,280
President Ji is already here.

289
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,980
He's in his office, having a meeting with directors.

290
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,700
I heard that this incident alarmed the head office.

291
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,520
President Ji is deeply troubled right now.

292
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
We have to be careful. Don't trigger him.

293
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,800
Dear me.

294
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,180
The work never ends.

295
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,320
Where is Tian'er?

296
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,720
 I'll go collect information for Yi.

297
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,380
 Remember to cover me up.

298
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,720
Dismiss.

299
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,440
President Ji, our IT Department did a massive search for plagiarism and found a strange comment.

300
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,940
I've sent it to your email box.

301
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,940
 Maybe someone lied to Qiao Yi, and that's why he didn't have the contract.

302
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,580
This person sounds like they know something.

303
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,040

304
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,440

305
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,620

306
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,360
We've texted this person.

307
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,000
But no response.

308
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,780
 About Qiao Yi's endorsement, we decided to suspend it.

309
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,960
Things changed with EX.

310
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Now we're pushed against the wall.

311
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,180
How could it be?

312
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,480
Why is this matter becoming more and more serious?

313
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,580
I know, right?

314
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,840
Qiao Yi has always been a pioneer against plagiarism.

315
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,860
He posted criticism on the plagiarism trend recently.

316
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,900
Who knows if this would happen?

317
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
It's like a slap in the face.

318
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,040
This is getting worse and worse.

319
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,220
Even our other writers are on the plagiarism trend recently.

320
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,120
The impact is dramatic.

321
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,880
The board of directors couldn't sit still and sent President Chen to discuss it.

322
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,320
Zhou Tian!

323
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,200
The only way is to sacrifice Qiao Yi to save the company.

324
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,480
Terminate his contract. Sever his ties to the company.

325
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,300
We have to cut our losses.

326
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,520
Don't affect the whole company because of a black sheep.

327
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,600
I think you know this well, right?

328
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,540
I do. The interests of the company are the priority no matter what.

329
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,060
I'm glad you think so.

330
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,900
Hurry up, then.

331
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,700
- President Chen, please. 
 - President Chen.

332
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,160
Oh, girl. Did President Ji scold you?

333
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,980
I just heard President Ji say the interests of the company are the priority.

334
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,000
And President Chen was urging him.

335
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,840
Sounds like they're abandoning Qiao Yi.

336
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,000
It can't be. Qiao Yi is the ace of Xing Yi Literature Division Department.

337
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,560
He's an uncrowned writer.

338
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,520
Qiao Yi is not just a writer. He is also of high brand value.

339
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,940
If the plagiarism is confirmed, the corresponding penalty is high.

340
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,840
- But Qiao Yi is innocent. 
 - Is he?

341
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,940
Don't say anything unless you know the specifics.

342
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,880
You know it. Qiao Yi told you, right?

343
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,800
But are you sure he didn't lie?

344
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,800
- President Chen. 
  - Congrats.

345
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Qiao Yi is yours again.

346
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,720
Do you really think he'll terminate Qiao Yi's contract?

347
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,960
If he lets Qiao Yi go,

348
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,140
what he said about doubling the performance will be really impossible.

349
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,220
He absolutely knows it.

350
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,000
Yet, in the current situation, if he refuses to abandon Qiao Yi,

351
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,860
Qiao Yi will become a negative asset.

352
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,980
By then, the penalty for the endorsements

353
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,500
will drain him.

354
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,260
I've found a friend in the press to investigate for me.

355
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Since Qiao Yi didn't plagiarize, we can prove his innocence

356
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,960
as long as we find that poster.

357
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,960
I told you to stay out of this.

358
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,060
- President Ji. 
 - P-President Ji.

359
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,020
We're just glancing over.

360
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,840
I-I think I've finished my job.

361
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,480
Maybe... I should leave now.

362
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
See you tomorrow, President Ji.

363
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Me too. I am going now.

364
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,760
Bye, President Ji.

365
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,360
They just abandoned me.

366
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,340
President Ji, I did stay out of it.

367
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,500
As an employee, I'm just concerned about it.

368
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,340
Maybe I can offer you some trifling clues.

369
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,080
No need.

370
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,380
President Ji, you must have a plan B now, right?

371
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,580
Seems you really want me to spare some time and fire you.

372
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,840
- Hello?
  - Zhou Tian, I found clues about the person you're looking for.

373
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,440
All right. I'll be right there.

374
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,380
 He'll scold me again if I tell him.

375
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,520
 I'd better go check it myself.

376
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,280
 I noticed that the city lights look like the starry sky

377
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,920
 when I stand upside down.

378
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,100
 So dreamy and so healing.

379
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,280
 My troubles, no matter how big it is, all vanish at that moment.

380
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,560
Universe, turn on night mode.

381
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,060
 President Ji, President Ji. I've contacted whoever wrote that comment.

382
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,480
 He was our intern.

383
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,060
President Ji, why is it so dark in your office?

384
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,440
President Ji, what's wrong with you? Are you dead, President Ji?

385
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,220
Get out.

386
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,900
Hold on.

387
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,780
I need you to go out with me.

388
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,740

389
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,800
 It's quite private here.

390
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,480
 Nothing will be spotted here.

391
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,140
Hi, Miss Zhou.

392
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm your personal trainer, Han Sen.

393
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,140
It's my pleasure to serve you.

394
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,940
Excuse me. Are you Li Xiang's husband?

395
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,960
Sorry, during working hours, I don't discuss my personal affairs.

396
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,740
I work for Qiao Yi's agency.

397
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,120
Why me? I have nothing to do with it.

398
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,340
I know.

399
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,800
I want to contact Ms. Li Xiang through you.

400
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,720
I want to confirm if there's any misunderstanding.

401
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
Li Xiang is my wife.

402
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,940
But I have nothing to do with it.

403
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,580
I've done the investigation.

404
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,320
The prototype of the character in this story is actually you.

405
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,340
Am I right?

406
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,180
So, back then, Li Luxi also contacted you, right?

407
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,880
Yeah, I did meet with Li Luxi.

408
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,700
And we signed... Sorry.

409
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,280
I know you want to help Qiao Yi.

410
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,960
But Li Xiang is my wife.

411
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,720
I love her. I can't betray her.

412
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,840
But what if you two are being used?

413
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,380
From the beginning to the end.

414
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,220
Since you love her,

415
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,400
why don't you try to help her get back on track?

416
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,180
Is it complicated?

417
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,560
Tricky. Where's Qiao Yi?

418
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,340
Being dumb.

419
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,260
You're here.

420
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,080
Here to terminate our contract?

421
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,940
Who says so?

422
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,680
Isn't this an open secret?

423
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,700
We'll hold an incident briefing to explain the whole story tomorrow.

424
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,100
I'll prepare your speech.

425
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,900
All right.

426
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,840
Have a good rest.

427
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,200
I'll return to the company.

428
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,920
Did President Ji force you to stay up all night?

429
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,960
Look at your dark circles.

430
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,440
I found a new witness who could testify for Qiao Yi

431
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,640
that he plagiarized under duress.

432
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,580
Great! President Ji is already here. Go tell him.

433
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,080
All right.

434
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,520
What about the influencers I told you to pay close attention to?

435
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,420
Two have no room for us tomorrow. Still negotiating.

436
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,600
About the briefing, it is all settled.

437
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
We've notified the media.

438
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,780
What briefing? Is it about Qiao Yi? What are you announcing?

439
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,000
- Who allowed you in? Who are you to ask? 
 - I...

440
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Don't ask me anything before the briefing tomorrow afternoon.

441
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,400
I don't want to answer any of your questions.

442
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,920
Out.

443
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,100
President Ji, this termination agreement...

444
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,780
 Termination?

445
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,240
 Qiao Yi is obviously being framed.

446
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,500
 At this point, as his talent manager, we choose to abandon him instead of helping him go through it?

447
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,860
 What the hell?

448
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,860
Shouldn't it be your triumphant return?

449
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,120
Why do you look gloomy?

450
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm quitting.

451
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,340
President Ji fired you?

452
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,000
No. I want to quit.

453
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,540
Come on. Why are you so mad?

454
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,080
You went through a lot to join Xing Yi. Did you forget it?

455
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,560
I didn't.

456
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,940
I just didn't expect this to be such a cold-blooded

457
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,640
and heartless company.

458
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,280
But even though I'm quitting,

459
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,220
I have to handle Qiao Yi's matter before I quit.

460
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,040
After all, I'm partly to blame for what happened till now.

461
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
What on earth happened?

462
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,760
They're terminating Qiao Yi's contract.

463
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,380
The contract is finished.

464
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,640
Seriously? Abandoning Qiao Yi?

465
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,460
Also, President Ji is holding a briefing to terminate Qiao Yi's contract openly.

466
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,800
They're trying to sever the ties to Qiao Yi in public.

467
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,520
Sacrificing Qiao Yi to protect Xing Yi. So ruthless.

468
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,440
Then, did you tell President Ji about what you've found?

469
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,260
Tell him what? He didn't let me speak,

470
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,760
but it's okay.

471
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,360
I don't expect President Ji to do anything more for Qiao Yi.

472
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,700
I can handle this on my own.

473
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,340

474
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,820

475
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,880
I told you not to come to me before the briefing.

476
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,020
I don't care what you say. I'm quitting my job.

477
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,480
Don't stop me no matter what I do.

478
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,720

479
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,940
Are you sure?

480
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,460
All right.

481
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,120
I'll submit your resignation to the HR Department after the briefing.

482
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,800
Hope you won't regret it.

483
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
I will never.

484
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,780
If I do, I'll bark.

485
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,860

486
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,800
Cheer up. Xing Yi stabbed you behind your back.

487
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,680
But you can join my new company.

488
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,400
I've prepared a termination agreement for you and sent it to Ji Chen.

489
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,540
Don't worry. I made you a star.

490
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,760
So, I can make you a star again.

491
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,240
You...

492
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,160
You're still willing to accept me?

493
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,240
What are you talking about?

494
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,080
We were partners who fought together from the very beginning.

495
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,060
No one knows you better than I do.

496
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,700
As I've said, you and me, we sink or swim together.

497
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,780
I'll definitely prove your innocence.

498
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:45,920

499
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:53,464
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

500
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,424
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

501
00:38:57,424 --> 00:39:02,024
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

502
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:07,794
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

503
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:12,554
♫  Finally, you’ve walked into my life  ♫

504
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:16,017
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

505
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:20,554
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

506
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:25,200
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

507
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:30,794
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

508
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:34,494
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

509
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:38,794
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

510
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:43,959
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

511
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:50,554
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

512
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,624
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

513
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:59,224
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

514
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:04,254
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

515
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:09,054
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

516
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:12,956
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

517
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:17,497
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

518
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:27,994
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

519
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:36,994
♫  Shine for you  ♫

520
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:45,664
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

521
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:49,494
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

522
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:54,002
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

523
