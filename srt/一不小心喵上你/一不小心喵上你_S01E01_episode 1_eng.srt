00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,430
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,330
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,330
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,530
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,880

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,300

18
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,920
 You can do it! You can do it!

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,260
 You can do it!

20
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,660
 Go for it!

21
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,900
 Go for it! Go!

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,080
 Go! Go!

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,300
 You can do it!

24
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,540
 Come on!

25
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,180
 You can do it!

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,440
 What a long leg.

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,240
 You can do it!

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,020
 Go for it! You can do it!

29
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,920
 But so what?

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,880
 The champion still belongs to me.

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,260
 You can do it! Go!

32
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,500
 You can do it!

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,460

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,040
It was close.

35
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,060
You want to run away?

36
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,160
Little kitty, you mess my house up so frequently.

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,580
And you even role-played a big boss in my dream.

38
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,960
I'll teach you a lesson today.

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,400
I can't bear to hit you,

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,020
but you can't get away if I pet you.

41
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,540
Qiu Qiu, why are you such an adorable little kitty!

42
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,180
Your fur feels soft.

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,160
Tell me, how can I hold back my desire to pet you?

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,300

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,960
 My name is Zhou Tian, a long-distance runner.

46
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,720
 Due to the injury to my right foot, I had to retire.

47
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
 It's hard to say goodbye to my athletic career,

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,020
 but all of us shall learn how to move forward.

49
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,080
 My life as an athlete came to an end.

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,100
 But the journey of my life has just begun.

51
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,940

52
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,900
 Zhou Tian, you can do it!

53
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,280
 Though I retired,

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,400
 I'll keep dedicating myself to the sports talent agent career

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
and the cause of sports for the rest of my life.

56
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,380

57
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,520
Morning, Zhou Tian.

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,500
Morning, Xin Xin.

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,980
I have an interview this morning, and I need to take off for a while.

60
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,920
But Senior, I will come to give you a hand later.

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,140
I'm really confused that you have a coffee shop,

62
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,800
but why are you still seeking a job?

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,040
It's your coffee shop, not mine.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,260
All the same.

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,780
Xiao Hei! Xin Xin, stay here. I'll get it back.

66
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,320
Are you all right?

67
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,140

68
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,100
S-Sorry.

69
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,660
You...

70
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,180
Get off of me.

71
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,240
I... I...

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,020
I... I'll call the ambulance for you.

73
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,400
I haven't made the call. Why has the ambulance arrived?

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,060
President Ji. What happened to you, President Ji?

75
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,240
Stay still.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,980
Come on.

77
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,120
Here we go.

78
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm Zhou Tian. I'll take responsibility.

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,760
Zhou Tian, right?

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,630
You'd better pray that President Ji is safe and sound.

81
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,280
Or you'll pay the price!

82
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,060

83
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I think I'm in big trouble.

84
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,350

85
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,810

86
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,420

(T/N: Ambulance Siren)

87
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,680
Normal blood pressure and heart rate. Stable vital signs.

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,740
No obvious abnormalities in his nervous system.

89
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,200
He seems only to suffer skin trauma.

90
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,500
We'll now help you deal with the injury.

91
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,840
After receiving the alarm through the sports bracelet,

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,700
we reached the spot in the shortest possible time.

93
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,000
If you are satisfied with our insurance first-aid service this time,

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,580
please give us a 5-star review.

95
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,220
Thank you.

96
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,500
With such a mild injury, you got me an ambulance.

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,540
Do you have to make such a big scene?

98
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,400
President Ji, I was worried about your safety.

99
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,960
Your intelligent alarm system is connected to my phone.

100
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,280
After I received the alarm, I did everything I could but still failed to connect with you.

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,840
I was anxious.

102
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,300
So I could only launch the first-aid insurance system at the highest level.

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,320
It won't happen again.

104
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,460

105
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,980

106
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,380

107
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720

108
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,290
 Look at Sister Lucy's face.

109
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,980
 The heavy makeup can barely cover her sullen face.

110
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,110
 That's understandable.

111
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,680
 Everyone thought that only she deserved to be the CEO.

112
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,020
 - Surprisingly, another person was designated to the position.  
- Whose phone keeps buzzing?

113
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,980
Are you that busy? But I don't see any accomplishment in your performance.

114
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,880
Who's it? Stand up.

115
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,540
 Gosh, I'm toast. The typhoon is at its tail.  
  (TN: End of typhoon is heavy rainfall)

116
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,230

117
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,440
Good morning, everyone. I'm Ji Chen.

118
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,660
I believe that you've learned my personal information through all kinds of channels.

119
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,120
I won't waste time introducing myself to you.

120
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,940
My sole purpose in coming to Xing Yi is to double our current performance within a year.

121
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,060
- Really? 
 - He meant it?

122
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,800
Is he this awesome?

123
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
He isn't kidding us, is he?

124
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,700
Now, on behalf of President Ji, I'll announce some latest company decisions.

125
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,820
Staff in the Cultural and Creative Department, please stand up.

126
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,120
You are dismissed.

127
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,980
- The department is dissolved now. 
  - Why?

128
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,100
- Why did he suddenly fire us? 
 - Why?

129
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,280
How could I know the reason?

130
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,080
No one knows.

131
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,300
You can't do this.

132
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,660
It's the traditional business of our company. And it's irreplaceable.

133
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,960
Every single of them means the fortune of our company.

134
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,960
A department that covers one-third of the company's operating costs,

135
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,680
but brings in no revenue,

136
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,240
I see no value in their being.

137
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,360
You are newly inaugurated. You know nothing about our department before you made the decision.

138
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,740
You affected the normal operation of our company.

139
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,760
Can you take full responsibility?

140
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,580
Xing Yi is a group that offers full service to the cultural and sports industry.

141
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,020
It's not irreplaceable.

142
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,440
This is last year's revenue for all the departments and the performance of employees.

143
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,180
Based on the profit, I set a passing line.

144
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,520
Whoever is above the line could stay.

145
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,060
On the contrary, one would be fired.

146
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,220
Li Luxi, you're also dismissed.

147
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,400

148
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,240
I devoted myself to Xing Yi all these years.

149
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,060
How could you fire me on the basis of a single year's performance?

150
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,600
How could you build your prestige among staff?

151
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,720

152
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
If I hadn't considered your contribution to our company,

153
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
the company wouldn't have let you off so easily

154
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,260
after you offered private jobs to Qiao Yi, and feathered your nest.

155
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,280
Well, I'm afraid the position of Xingyi's CEO will not necessarily be yours.

156
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,460
You'd better learn how many actors in Xingyi were groomed by me.

157
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,040
If I leave, do you think they'll stay here?

158
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,100
It's my problem if they refuse to stay.

159
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,420
But no matter what, you cannot stay.

160
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,120
Just wait for the day when you beg me to come back!

161
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,720
Let's continue.

162
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,340
Next, staff of the Sports Division Department, please stand up.

163
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,600
First, as a long-distance athlete,

164
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,100
I think I have a better understanding of the sports industry

165
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,420
and the athletes than most people.

166
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,320
Besides, I love the sports industry.

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
The sports talent agent is more than a job to me,

168
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
but the continuation of the sports industry.

169
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
At work, I'm more active than anyone else.

170
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,020
And my willpower has reached a new height over the years as an athlete.

171
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,800
Since the first day I entered the sports school,

172
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,640
I was told that the key point of the long-distance race is not the speed,

173
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,080
nor endurance, but the spirit of insistence and challenge.

174
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,340
It doesn't just work on running, but each industry, and even life.

175
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,140
 The comprehension from the experiences is more important than the superficial scores.

176
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,440
 That's the power to drive us forward.

177
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,080
 Thus, I badly want to get the job.

178
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,700
 Hopefully, I could do something to help the sports industry,

179
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,360
 and to expand the market for sporting events that few people care about.

180
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,260
 I know my resume has little advantage over anyone else's.

181
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,020
 If the company only wants to hire someone

182
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,140
 who shares the matching rate with the position,

183
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,340
 I'm not your perfect choice indeed.

184
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,240
But if you want an employee who has a strong sense of belonging,

185
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,480
and who treats the work as a career and strives for accomplishment,

186
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,420
I promise I'll be your best choice.

187
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,300
Miss Zhou Tian?

188
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,320
Hello.

189
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,270
Our new CEO made the latest decision in the meeting just now

190
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,160
that the Sports Division Department is dismissed.

191
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,520
So your interview is canceled.

192
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,560
Cancel?

193
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,840
Does your CEO make decisions that casually?

194
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,900
T-Then, why it was canceled?

195
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,960
How about I have a word with him?

196
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,300
Don't bother.

197
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,320
I still have something else to do. Please excuse me.

198
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Xiao Xia.

199
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,200
Hi, Zhou Tian. Where are you?

200
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,660
 Outside the elevator.

201
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,300
 I'm about to leave.

202
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,880
 I know you're in the middle of a meeting, so I'm not going to bother you.

203
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,780
I was just informed that due to the policy adjustment,

204
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,600
my interview was canceled.

205
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,960
I know. Wait.

206
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,120
I have a way to make you stay.

207
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,400
You want me to take the interview in the Performing Arts Department?

208
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,420
Get the offer, and then apply for an internal position transfer.

209
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,100
Will it work?

210
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,440
Performing Arts Department is the best department in Xing Yi.

211
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,840
As long as you perform well enough, once the company offers the chance of position transfer,

212
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,200
you'll get a 100% possibility to make it.

213
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,300
A kind reminder, this is the only way out for you now.

214
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,400
You do make a point.

215
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,540
But will it be troublesome to deal with those actors?

216
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,620
I think you've been in the athlete team for way too long.

217
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,020
You're completely out of touch with society.

218
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,310
You could consider having your own corporation.

219
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,560
Otherwise, no job in the world is easy to deal with.

220
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,080
Since this is the case,

221
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,460
why don't you choose to work with those beauties and hunks?

222
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,920
At least, they are pleasing to the eye.

223
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,000
Makes sense.

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
Good point! I got enlightened!

225
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,760
Okay. That's settled. Let's get it.

226
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
Follow me. Come on.

227
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,880
This way.

228
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,100

229
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,460
President Ji. Referring to your habits, we've installed a fully intelligent office system.

230
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,780
All of your healthcare drugs have been prepared.

231
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,240
I placed them in the first drawer on the left side of your table.

232
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,960
 President Ji. I'm Universe, your intelligent assistant.

233
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,420
 You have a meeting soon.

234
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,140
 Launch the meeting mode or not?

235
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,660
Yes.

236
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,080

237
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,980

238
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,380

239
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,840
 Ji Chen. On behalf of Xing Yi,

240
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,040
 I give you a warm welcome to be transferred from the headquarters.

241
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,200
 But we're all curious as to why you make such a big scene when you've just taken office.

242
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
 You've made everyone panicked, and also fired Lucy.

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
 She is a venerable employee.

244
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,240
I value performance as well as loyalty to the company.

245
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,680
Taking advantage of one's seniority cannot get my pass card.

246
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,380
Most people in our company were groomed by Lucy.

247
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,760
I highly suggest that you should get her back as soon as possible.

248
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,060
You've made a pledge with the group.

249
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,630
If they were all taken away by Lucy,

250
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,020
how could you achieve your goal?

251
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,850
If I listen to you and keep Lucy,

252
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,340
and we fail to double our performance.

253
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,620
President Chen, will you share the responsibility?

254
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,700

255
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,280
On the contrary, I'll be held accountable for every word I said and every promise I made.

256
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
Thanks for all of your concerns.

257
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,680
That's all for the meeting.

258
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,020

259
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,040
Your company has quite a strong lineup.

260
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,520
Of course. Xing Yi is the top domestic cultural company.

261
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,760
We have some of the best athletes, writers, and actors in the country and around the world.

262
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,700
That's what you call promising.

263
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,960
But there has been a bit of a decline in recent years.

264
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
But the new boss, President Ji is as cold as marble.

265
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
He's bold and resolute.

266
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,080
As soon as he took office, he got rid of some incompetent people.

267
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
Hope he will get Xing Yi back on top.

268
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,940
The new boss is pretty handsome.

269
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,580
Why are you still the same as when you were little?

270
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,820
You're easily distracted by handsome guys.

271
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,020
If not, would I come here and be a publicist in Xing Yi?

272
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,820
I just do what I want.

273
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,860
You haven't seen him.

274
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,300
You'll know after you see him.

275
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,800
He looks much more good-looking than an actor.

276
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,860
The new boss is not only handsome but also capable.

277
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,220
As soon as he took office, he dismissed the leader in my department.

278
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,500
Lucy and her collusive Cultural and Creative Department were fired.

279
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,240
That's so pleasurable.

280
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,660
They were all money but no work.

281
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,580
We did all the work.

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Hello?

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,540
The second conference room, right?

284
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,740
All right, got it.

285
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,280
Zhou Tian, I have something to do later. I have to take my leave now.

286
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,720
Our director's office is over there.

287
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,360
The first area is on the right.

288
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,060
The office is behind the left conference room.

289
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,120
Get it? I have told them.

290
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,140
You come to be my intern first. Let's get you employed first.

291
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,720
The interview is just going through the motions. Don't be nervous.

292
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
Come on. I have to do my work now.

293
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,620
- Bye.
- Wait.

294
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Where is it?

295
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,140
Where are the people?

296
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,280
Left.

297
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,040
I think it's left.

298
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,240
A desk or an office?

299
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,000
Director.

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,660
I guess he should have a separate office.

301
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Hi, I'm here for an interview.

302
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,780
Can I help you with something?

303
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,200
S-Sorry.

304
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,540
It's you.

305
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,020

306
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,540

307
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,080

308
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,260
President Ji.

309
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Stay away from me.

310
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,100
 He's fine.

311
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,840
 That's great. I finally can relax.

312
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,760
 But, am I so unlucky? I guess he's the director.

313
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,560
 I hurt him up so badly before.

314
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
 He must hold a grudge against me.

315
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,320
President Ji, are you all right, President Ji?

316
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,020
I'm fine.

317
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,880
 President Ji?

318
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,440
 Is he the new CEO of Xing Yi?

319
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,400
 However, I've already met him.

320
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
 But the new boss, Mr. Ji is as cold as marble.

321
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,160
 He's bold and resolute.

322
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,460
You're not Xing Yi's employee, right?

323
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,860
Who are you?

324
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,360
I'm sorry. I went the wrong way.

325
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,300
Hold on.

326
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,360
President Ji is talking to you.

327
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,580
 He's tied up all the time. He must have forgotten me.

328
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,340
 - He must have forgotten me.  
 - I remember you.

329
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,940
 No. I have to change his bad impression of me.

330
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,960
 I crossed the big boss. This will not end well for me.

331
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,120
 What should I do?

332
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,320
 Try to get his sympathy?

333
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,260
 The new boss is not only handsome but capable.

334
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,020
 As soon as he took office, he dismissed the leader in my department.

335
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,520
 Practical and reasonable.

336
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,040
 S-Sorry.

337
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,980
 I feel like I've taken up the wrong side of the fence.

338
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,060
Who are you?

339
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,240
You just said you're here for an interview, right?

340
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,900
- Resume. 
 -  I can't give him my resume. In case he'll make it personal and take revenge on me.

341
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,400
President Ji is asking for your resume. Why don't you hand it over?

342
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,380
Give it to me.

343
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,800
I...

344
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,240
I've kept my distance.

345
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,820

346
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,780
Zhou Tian.

347
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,160
Tell personnel not to hire her.

348
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,560
Okay.

349
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,720
You...

350
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,160
You haven't asked me what position I'm applying for.

351
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,840
We haven't even had an interview yet. Why have you decided not to hire me?

352
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,880
President Ji is the biggest boss of Xing Yi.

353
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,650
Since that he said you can't be hired. Then you can't be hired.

354
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,060
But that is just between us.

355
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,260
You said you didn't know me, didn't you?

356
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,180
You're so good at pretending.

357
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,660
President Ji, Xing Yi is a big company.

358
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,720
I don't think it's good that you get the absolute right here.

359
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,540

360
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,100

361
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,460

362
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,820

363
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,300
Improved to bachelor's degree through self-study.

364
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,580
No work experience at all.

365
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,540
No manners at all.

366
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,260
President Ji, manners can be adjusted.

367
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,260
A diploma can be further improved by studying.

368
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,640
As for work experience,

369
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,340
I know the people who have work experience have an advantage.

370
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,480
But as for this job, it doesn't mean I can't do it without experience.

371
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,560
A talent manager just needs to associate with others and can take care of others, right?

372
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,720
- I can do all that. 
 - Associate with others? Take care of others?

373
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,820
Is that how you define this job?

374
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,480
I may have been a little indiscreet in my choice of words.

375
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
Let me reorganize my words.

376
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,560
I think if they are the shining stars in the crowd.

377
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
Then the talent manager is a magician with a magic wand

378
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,160
who makes the stars shine.

379
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,840
It seems that you're really good at socializing.

380
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Okay. Well, let me tell you the real state of the cultural agency business.

381
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,920
Tensions will run high.

382
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,020
They are constantly confronted with emergencies.

383
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,440
Either solving the problem or on the way to solving the problem.

384
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,380
We're not magicians who can turn everything into gold without putting in any effort.

385
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,980
But we're the trainers who train and push them to the front.

386
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,700
Trainer.

387
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,240
Magician.

388
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,100
Aren't they just different interpretations of the same thing?

389
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,880
Do you have to be so elaborate?

390
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,580
If you're not 100 percent passionate, don't go into this field.

391
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,180
However, I don't see any passion in your eyes.

392
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,660
Kevin, see her off.

393
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,220
All right.

394
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,340
President Ji.

395
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,920
Please.

396
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,140

397
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,620

398
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,500

399
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,040
Your coffee.

400
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,780
Thank you.

401
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,300
Thank you.

402
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,140
So handsome.

403
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,980
- Behave yourself well.
- Behave yourself well.

404
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,960
Don't let others notice you.

405
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,500
- I finally see him. 
 - He's indeed handsome.

406
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,420
He's handsome, right?

407
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,100
Boss, sales shot up every time you come into the store.

408
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,160
Really?

409
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,740
Look.

410
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,380
You're indeed the best coffee maker in the cross-country running field.

411
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,560
It seems that Tian Tian failed the interview again.

412
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,980
Tian Tian, you're back.

413
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,020
- Waiter.
 - Senior.

414
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,740
Excuse me.

415
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,980
A cup of chocolate will lift your mood.

416
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,180
Thank you.

417
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,160
I had a particularly bad day today.

418
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,880
I offended the big boss of the company that I had the interview this early morning.

419
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,380
Why would such a small chance happen to me?

420
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,300
However, why couldn't I win the lottery?

421
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,460
I know. It was my fault.

422
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,860
I scared him.

423
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,300
He's a CEO.

424
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,780
However, he made it personal and revenged on me.

425
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,340
That was too inappropriate.

426
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,140
There are all kinds of people in such a big world.

427
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,120
You don't need to be angry.

428
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,700
It's not worth it if you get ill because of anger.

429
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,620
It's better not to follow such a boss.

430
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,620
You just stay in Kitties' Fairyland.

431
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,060
You always want to run a cat cafe, don't you?

432
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,900
I'll hand over the store to you.

433
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,940
Then you won't be bullied by others.

434
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,800
I know you're doing it for my own sake.

435
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,420
However, I can't stay here forever.

436
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,980
I also want to try something more challenging.

437
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,520
Why not?

438
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,100
I'll always have your back.

439
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,760
I mean I want to do something that contributes to the sports field.

440
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
I know.

441
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,560
But you don't need to rush to find a job.

442
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,420
Before you get a job, you can always stay here.

443
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,360
Waiter, our desserts.

444
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,460
I'm fine.

445
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,500
Start working now.

446
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,920

447
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,440
I finally can have a rest.

448
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,920
Qiu Qiu.

449
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,680
Qiu Qiu.

450
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,980
Bad Qiu Qiu.

451
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,480
Why didn't you come to welcome me when I came back?

452
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,660
Qiu Qiu. Qiu Qiu.

453
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,280
Qiu Qiu.

454
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,160

455
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,680

456
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,860

457
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,900

458
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,140

459
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,820
Qiu Qiu.

460
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,780
Qiu Qiu!

461
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,700
- Have you seen a cat? 
 - No.

462
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,020
My cat is lost. Have you seen it?

463
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,060
- Have you seen this cat? 
 - No.

464
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,720
Qiu Qiu!

465
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,520
Qiu Qiu!

466
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,520
Sir, have you seen my cat?

467
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,780
No.

468
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,740
Please look carefully.

469
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,780
- No. 
 - All right, thank you.

470
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,680
Why does it look so much like my Xueqiu?

471
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,040
And it's also gluttonous.

472
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,660

473
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,760
Tian'er, how is it going there?

474
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,860
Dad, Mom.

475
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,560
What are you doing outside so late?

476
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,460
I just had dinner with my friends.

477
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,860
 How was your interview today?

478
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,100
It went well. I think I can start the job next week.

479
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,740
I told you there was no problem.

480
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,460
 My daughter is so excellent.

481
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,480
I'm telling you. You're promising.

482
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,720
Y-You are the pride of our family.

483
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Dad, you're flattering me.

484
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,420
Tian'er, you got a new job.

485
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,460
Do you feel stressed?

486
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,440
Why do I feel you're not very happy when you get the job?

487
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,860
No stress.

488
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,320
 How is it possible?

489
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,540
How can work be stress-free?

490
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,280
 It doesn't matter if you feel stressed.

491
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,660
 You can relax yourself.

492
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,120
If you can't stand the stress, you can go home.

493
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,580
Keep my words in your mind.

494
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,820
 You're our precious daughter.

495
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,960
No one can bully you.

496
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,520
Dad, my phone is running out of battery.

497
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm going back to my place now. Talk to you later after I get my phone recharged.

498
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
 Take care.

499
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,420
All right.

500
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,180
Qiu Qiu, where are you?

501
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,800
You must be starving.

502
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,570

503
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,120
It's so clean.

504
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Are you really lost?

505
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,660
Aren't you full yet?

506
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:19,970

507
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,660
There're only a few sashimis left. Would you like to eat it?

508
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,300
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

509
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,260
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

510
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,760
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

511
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,630
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

512
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,390
♫  Finally, you've came into my life  ♫

513
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,778
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

514
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:57,595
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

515
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:02,000
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

516
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,630
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

517
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,130
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

518
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,930
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

519
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,095
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

520
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,390
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

521
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,330
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

524
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:45,755
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

525
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:49,660
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

526
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,250
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

527
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:03,830
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

528
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,430
♫  Shine for you  ♫

529
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,200
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

530
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,292
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

531
