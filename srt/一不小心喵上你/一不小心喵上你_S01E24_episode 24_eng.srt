1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:22,160

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,730
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,230
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,130
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,230
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,790
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,720

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,460

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800

18
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,540
 I'll take Qiuqiu to meet with someone and go to work later.

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,620
 I'll be there on time.

20
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,640

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
It can't be real that she goes on a blind date, right?

22
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,660
In you go.

23
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,940
Every time we come here, you'll fight with other cats.

24
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,660
No snack for you today. I'm warning you.

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,880
Dear Mom.

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,760
Can you let me know in advance when you come next time?

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,160
It's always like a surprise attack.

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm a human being. I have my liberty.

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,900
I came yesterday for a show.

30
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
I was so nice that I didn't tell you.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,540
I slept at your Auntie's place.

32
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,740
Not a cozy night at all.

33
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,640
When some people say they are nice, they are not nice at all.

34
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,260
Anyway, you asked me to take Qiu Qiu here.

35
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,340
I took her here.

36
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,020
You saw it yourself.

37
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,900
She can't mingle with other cats.

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,920
And Ji Chen doesn't agree.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,940
So about the blind date, thanks, but no, thanks.

40
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,360
I have to work later. I have ordered you a luxury breakfast.

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,860
Finish it and go home.

42
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,040
My dad is lonely at home.

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Xin Xin, I'll go to work. And I'll pick Qiu Qiu up after work.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Please look after her for me.

45
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,100
All right.

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,960
Hey, wait. You...

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,660
This child...

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,420
Auntie, here's your breakfast.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,660
Auntie, I heard it all.

50
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,120
If you have to make her date, I know many boys.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,240
Handsome. Well-shaped.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,740
Foreign boys.

53
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,220
You can rest assured and go home.

54
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll introduce them to Zhou Tian.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,180
She can choose whatever she wants.

56
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,900
We don't have to let Ji Chen know. Right?

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,420
Don't you have to let me know?

58
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,900
Don't you know that Zhou Tian is taken?

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,760
But, Brother Chen, it's all right even though she's taken.

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,260
She can still have it if she wants.

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,060
When they have babies, I can find a foster family if you don't want to keep them.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,380
And you want her to have babies!

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,640
Fine. Never mind what I said.

64
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,700
I going to go. Enjoy your time.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,980
Son-in-law, take a seat.

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,160
Xiao Tian just left.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,400
What are you two...

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,700
Auntie, I actually followed her here.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,320
About the blind date, I need to talk with you.

70
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,980
Xiao Tian already talked to me.

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,560
Let's forget it if you don't agree.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,820
You don't have to overthink it.

73
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,900
I have to.

74
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,400
I understand it.

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,460
You are worried about me being hospitalized.

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,120
But I'm healthy now.

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,160
Also, I promise to make her happy with everything I have.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,020
I knew it.

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,700
My future son-in-law is so caring.

80
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,720
It's a blessing for her to be with you.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,400
But she's old enough.

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,660
She needs to have a baby even if she doesn't need a blind date.

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,560
Or it will be a waste of her great genes.

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,180
Are you really this anxious?

85
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,160
Yes, of course, I am.

86
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,280
This is a serious matter.

87
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
It can't be done casually. No.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,400
So you are saying we should hold a ceremony?

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,420
Great!

90
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,760
It'll be great to have a ceremony.

91
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,100
I understand now.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,800
Rest assured.

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll give her an unforgettable wedding.

94
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,040
Unforgettable.

95
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,840
A president's idea is certainly unique.

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,800
All right. It's settled then.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,060
When you get everything ready, invite us to join you, all right?

98
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,100
All right. Great.

99
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,980
Then, Auntie, I'll go get it done now.

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,420
So... Well...

101
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,880
Qiu Qiu, my son-in-law is holding you a wedding!

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,480

103
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,340

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,260
President Ji, Bobosnap will hold a fashion party in a few days.

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,880
The group Six Up, the six girls, will attend it.

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,160
The Business Cooperation Department got them a jewelry sponsor.

107
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,220
See if this one will do.

108
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,440
I think they didn't have shops in our country.

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,840
President Ji, you don't like their design?

110
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,780
They just entered the domestic market.

111
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,180
Business Cooperation Department spent a lot of effort in winning them.

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
No.

113
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,480
I think their design is very stunning.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,060
Go to their shop to order me a ring.

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,420
Ring.

116
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,460
Also, don't come back again if you insist on answering my question with your question.

117
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,200
Sorry, President Ji. I won't do that again.

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,380
I'll go order the ring now.

119
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,320
President Ji! The ring style and size, which one would you prefer?

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,360
About this...

121
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,900
Go to the shop first.

122
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,080
I'll text you about it later.

123
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,740
Take a seat.

124
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
You need me?

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,740
Have you had breakfast?

126
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,140
Not yet.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,320
I had an urgent this morning, so I didn't wait for you.

128
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll do better next time.

129
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,980
I won't ask you about what you did.

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,120
Your breakfast is in the refrigerator in the pantry.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
Remember to heat it before you eat it.

132
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,480
Thank you for your care and consideration.

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,520
I'll go get it now.

134
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,020
Hold on.

135
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,120
I have something to talk to you about.

136
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,320
Six Up will attend Bobosnap's fashion party.

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,240
Business Cooperation Department won a jewelry sponsor. Select some with me.

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,380
Isn't this their stylist's work?

139
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,800
Stylist...

140
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,220
Yeah, their stylist will select the dress and accessories.

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,700
Yet the theme this time is "Shiny Fingers".

142
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,420
So we have to choose a ring for everyone.

143
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Me?

144
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,600
But what I like may not suit them.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
Just make your choice. Choose what you like.

146
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,280
Let me have a look.

147
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,180
This one is so beautiful.

148
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,640
Are you sure?

149
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,020
This one is simple, not complicated, which is in line with the current aesthetics.

150
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,440
All right, it's settled then.

151
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,660

152
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,180
All right. I want this one.

153
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,660
Please wrap this for me.

154
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,200
No problem.

155
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,820
But Xue has bigger finger joints.

156
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,580
This one suits her.

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,760
But it may not suit others.

158
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,180
If it is on Ke's or my finger, it will look too big.

159
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,980
So...

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
Any problem?

161
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,520
Nope.

162
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,420
So, what kind of ring

163
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,660
should Ke'er or you wear?

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,920
Ke'er...

165
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,340
This one's cute.

166
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,900
Are you sure?

167
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,360
The square diamond looks more solid and stable. Also sassy.

168
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,540
All right. This one, then.

169
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,440
Here you are.

170
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,080

171
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,220
Anything else I can do for you?

172
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
I want to return this.

173
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,120
A square diamond ring this time.

174
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,300
I think this one will do, right?

175
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,380
Yup. Thanks.

176
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,060

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,680
But...

178
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,660
I want to return this.

179
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,510
I want to return this.

180
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,720
R-Return this.

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,900

182
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,860
Again.

183
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,880
Again... Again.

184
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000

185
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,060
Wait. Don't shake your head.

186
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,860
Can you make up your mind this time?

187
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,480
Choose one, make up your mind this time?

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Trust me.

189
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,440
This one will definitely dazzle.

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,400
This one. I'm sure.

191
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,700
Thank God, we won't have a seventh.

192
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,140
Sorry. I want to return again.

193
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,240
I swear this is the last time.

194
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,080
Security. Kick him out.

195
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,580
No.

196
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,440
Wait. I have practiced Tai Chi.

197
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,660
Don't touch me.

198
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,960
I want to buy a ring.

199
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,080
By the way,

200
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,680
have you thought about what kinda wedding you want?

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,840
No. Why? I'm not marrying anyone.

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,600
 She hasn't thought about getting marry?

203
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,580
Done.

204
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll go enjoy your love breakfast in the pantry.

205
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,060
Ke'er has fair skin.

206
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,900
If she wears this one...

207
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,880
Getting married is such a big deal.

208
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,380
Why haven't you thought about it?

209
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,440
I now don't care which ring others want.

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
Think for yourself.

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,380
Which one do you want?

212
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,660
Take your time. Think clearly.

213
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,440
Take all these with you.

214
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,600
All right, President Ji.

215
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,860
 What is wrong with him again?

216
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,160
 Is it because I didn't wait for him this morning?

217
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,700
Don't try to scare me.

218
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,180
Busted.

219
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,620
I think you're influenced by President Ji now.

220
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,560
You are as sharp and sensitive as he is.

221
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
Stop it.

222
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,870
Wow!

223
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,820
Love breakfast?

224
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,020
You can't have made it yourself, right?

225
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,640
President Ji! He cooked himself!

226
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,120
This even smells like love.

227
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,800
No wonder you went to his office

228
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,080
and stayed there for half an hour.

229
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,560
Your love is filling the whole company up.

230
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
Enough.

231
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,980
It was about business.

232
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,980
About Six Up.

233
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,680
President Ji wanted me to select diamond rings for them.

234
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,700
What?

235
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,680
Diamond ring?

236
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,520
You selected it?

237
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,940
My God, my Tian Tian.

238
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,780
I see this more clearly than you.

239
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,560
He's doing all this for you.

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
Selecting rings for the girl group?

241
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,780
Isn't it an excuse to find out what you like?

242
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,860
You mean he wants to select a wedding ring?

243
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,900
And I think your wedding

244
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,080
will be coming really soon.

245
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,260
What a wild guess.

246
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,800
We just handled Lucy's matter.

247
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,460
Xing Yi is at a critical moment of development.

248
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,480
And I just entered a new field.

249
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,800
We both are too busy to get married.

250
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,080
What if your Chen proposes to you?

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,220
Will you say yes, yes, or yes?

252
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,280
We'll see.

253
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
All right. I'll talk it over with Qiao Yi.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
Thanks.

255
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,240
President Ji, I have made the ring selection.

256
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,120
No more changes?

257
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,480
Good.

258
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,340
Next, I need to talk to you about some specific work.

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,240
Really business this time?

260
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,060
It's always business.

261
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,760

262
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,780
President Ji, please.

263
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,000
In the next quarter,

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,140
there are several actors whose films will be released.

265
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,080
Marketing Department has formulated different publicity plans for them.

266
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,720
It's a great learning opportunity for you

267
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,860
if you can participate.

268
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,820
I'll be more specific.

269
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,080
Nine in total.

270
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,800
First, the publicity and delivery of traditional media.

271
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,740
 The publicity and putting of traditional media ads focus on...

272
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,280
The seventh.

273
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,700
Including this fashion event

274
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,880
as well as below-the-line activities and variety shows.

275
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,940

276
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,220
Sorry. I'll remember to mute it.

277
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,140
It's all right. Maybe it's urgent.

278
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,940
You can pick it up.

279
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,680
I'll be right back.

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
Mom?

281
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm in a meeting.

282
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,280
Blind date?

283
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,740
Let's forget about it.

284
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm having a meeting.

285
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,080
 Blind date?

286
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,940
 Why is she still rushing Tian Tian?

287
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,620
 Does she think I'm too slow about our wedding?

288
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,380
I'm done, President Ji. Let's continue.

289
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,040
President Ji?

290
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,100
The seventh.

291
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,780
Including this fashion event

292
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,540
as well as below-the-line activities and variety shows.

293
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,500

294
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,020
Shine Record, Sweet Tongue...

295
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Marry me.

296
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,420
Is that a yes?

297
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,580
Of course, yes. You arranged it all.

298
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
Then...

299
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,940

300
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,140
It's Qiao Yi.

301
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,740
- Hello? 
 -  Zhou Tian,

302
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,160
 come get Li Ang out of here.

303
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,460
 I can't record with him here.

304
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,960
What? What happened?

305
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
I'll be there right now. Don't panic.

306
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,860
 Hurry.

307
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,040
It's about Qiao Yi. I have to go now.

308
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,400
Zhou Tian, about our wedding...

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,840

310
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,660

311
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,520
Zhou Tian.

312
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
No.

313
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,320
If I ride a bike, I will never catch up with her.

314
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,120
Wait.

315
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,360
How much is your trike for a day?

316
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,980
- Zhou Tian! 
 - Ji Chen?

317
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,700
Why... Why are you riding a trike?

318
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,860
I haven't finished my words just now.

319
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,840
You said yes to me, right?

320
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,520
Yes to you?

321
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,060
You mean those projects?

322
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,120
Of course.

323
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,420
I said it in the office.

324
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,060
Marry me.

325
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,080
All right.

326
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,900
Are you seriously?

327
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,360
Why not?

328
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,180
Is it a variety show on WeTV or some other channels?

329
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,560
Is Qiao Yi attending it?

330
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,240
You really thought it was a show?

331
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,880
What? You don't sound rational.

332
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
Are you too tired?

333
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,160
How should I explain this to you?

334
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,900
Zhou Tian, listen to me.

335
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,940
It's my mom.

336
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,940
Hello, Mom. What's wrong?

337
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,700
What?

338
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,580
Betrothal gifts.

339
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,100
All right. I get it. Talk to you later.

340
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,640
Bye.

341
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,440
Seven or eight trucks pulled over outside my parents' house with goods on them.

342
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
The driver said it was betrothal gifts from the Ji family.

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,620
Yes, it is. I sent them.

344
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,600
Now you see?

345
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,980
So you asked me to select a ring.

346
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,200
The variety show "Marry Me". And the betrothal gifts.

347
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,880
It's all because you're planning a wedding?

348
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,990
Yup. There's no variety show at all.

349
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,000
Auntie is rushing our wedding,

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,040
so I sent the betrothal gifts today.

351
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,340
But... it's my first time preparing for a wedding. I'm a rookie.

352
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,540
Did I do it the right way?

353
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,260
But this is a big deal. Why didn't you talk to me before you actually did it?

354
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,450
Everyone in the neighborhood knows it now.

355
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,140
Should I marry you or not?

356
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,540
Don't you want to marry me?

357
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,400
It's not like that.

358
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,300
President Ji.

359
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,980
Ji Chen.

360
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,300
Actually, we have not been officially together for a long time.

361
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,040
Officially together?

362
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,020
We work together. We are together day and night.

363
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,960
But we're busy now. We just handled Lucy and President Chen's matter.

364
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,160
You said it yourself. You will get Xing Yi back on track.

365
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,540
So you worry about me.

366
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,440
It's all right.

367
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,380
I can balance my life and career.

368
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,940
But we have three to four projects on our plate.

369
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,080
Do we have time for a wedding?

370
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,280
Those are projects for the company.

371
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,360
The wedding is a project for our life. They two can go hand in hand.

372
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,740
I... Why can't you understand what I'm trying to say?

373
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,980
- Zhou... 
 - Qiao Yi is rushing me.

374
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,780
Mine's faster. I'll drive you there.

375
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,160
Sit tight.

376
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,280

377
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,060

378
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,120
I didn't expect this matter would be solved smoothly.

379
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,280
I feel like we didn't help any little at all.

380
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,240
Qiao Yi didn't want to replace anyone in his heart.

381
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,800
They just needed to give each other an out.

382
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,620
Qiao Yi is right, actually.

383
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,220
We are two completely different people.

384
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,340
One is slow, and the other is fast. One is quiet, and the other is loud.

385
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,540
One is a crocodile, and the other is...

386
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,140
A husky.

387
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,440
I am the smartest even if I really am a husky.

388
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,840
So many differences between us, yet we make a great couple.

389
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,980
It's kind of unbelievable.

390
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,500
There are no two people who are exactly alike in this world.

391
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,020
We all need a time period to get to know each other.

392
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,220
Zhou Tian,

393
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,260
I was being unthoughtful to plan the wedding alone in secret.

394
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,980
But I don't know why

395
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,820
my feelings for you are this overwhelming.

396
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,680
I would say the same thing to you

397
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,420
even if your mom didn't call.

398
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,700
Will you marry me, Zhou Tian?

399
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,380
I'm not going to say no,

400
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,120
but it has only been a few months

401
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,300
since we got to know each other. So...

402
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,120
You think this is coming on too strong, right?

403
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
But we work together and stay together day and night.

404
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,060
One month to us is like a year to others.

405
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,660
So, according to this, we have been together for years.

406
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,900
Does this equation make sense?

407
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,760
Then, Xing Yi?

408
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,440
Too many projects.

409
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,620
Too much pressure. Right?

410
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,560
Don't worry. I'll help.

411
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,020
And I can recruit a new executive talent manager for Qiao Yi to set you free.

412
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,940
Then, my parents?

413
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,620
They may disagree or question my health, right?

414
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,880
It's all right. Don't worry.

415
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,940
I have got their receipt form for those betrothal gifts.

416
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,440
They won't return the gift and take you back from me.

417
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,460
And our colleagues.

418
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,540
They may discuss with each other and gossip, right?

419
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,060
Don't worry.

420
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,280
I can set up an internal studio for you.

421
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,140
We'll distinguish between the interests of superiors and subordinates.

422
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,160
If anyone gossips about us,

423
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,080
I will make him unable to gossip again.

424
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,120
But...

425
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,640
No more but.

426
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,360
If we were in a 24-episode of TV play,

427
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,040
I would have wooed you for 23 episodes.

428
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,280
We can solve any problem in front of us.

429
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,560
Zhou Tian, can you give me your answer now?

430
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
Then,

431
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,440
all right.

432
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,040
What?

433
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,660
It's to the question you asked me.

434
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,040
I said all right.

435
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,000
Really?

436
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,060
You don't have any more "buts", right?

437
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,960
I won't.

438
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,880
I will marry you.

439
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,550
What did you say? It's a bit noisy here.

440
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,260
I didn't really catch you.

441
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,720
I said I would marry you.

442
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,260
I will marry you.

443
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,480
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

444
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,460
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

445
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,660
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

446
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,100
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

447
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,440
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

448
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,200
Dear guests, ladies, and gentlemen, glad to see you all.

449
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,800
Welcome to this grand wedding.

450
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,100
Meeting and being with someone. It's a beautiful fate.

451
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,300
Hope you can always be together and be happy together.

452
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Do you agree?

453
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,020
Now, best man and maid of honor, please invite the bride and groom out.

454
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,920
Please.

455
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,300
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

456
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,610
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

457
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:45,780
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

458
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,310
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

459
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,280
Why are there two cats at the wedding?

460
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,720
Didn't you read the invitation?

461
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,620
It's Qiu Qiu's wedding.

462
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,320

463
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,300
Someone's seriously holding a wedding for the cats!

464
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,540
Yes, a wedding for the cats.

465
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,260
Back then, Ji Chen thought I was rushing Tian Tian to see other men.

466
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,500
But I was talking about Qiu Qiu.

467
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,120
Although we made it clear in the end,

468
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,270
he didn't give up on having a wedding for the cats. And what a wedding.

469
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,090
Our son-in-law is a CEO.

470
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,020
Of course, it would be a grand wedding.

471
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,580
But does he really have to spend so much on the cats' wedding?

472
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,120
What do you know? It's a pet business project planned by President Ji and Zhou Tian.

473
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,180
Full live broadcast.

474
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,640
Many pet brands sponsored this.

475
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,840
Maybe a star will be created here.

476
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,740
A star?

477
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
Who?

478
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,900
Qiu Qiu?

479
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,820
Everything is possible.

480
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,020
Now, the bride and groom, pawbump, please.

481
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,240
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

482
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,240
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

484
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,340
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

485
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:22,920
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

486
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,380
The cat is running away. I'm scared.

487
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,900
(Return!)

488
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,980
Congratulations, Brother Yi. Your new book received a lot of praise.

489
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,760
Just a piece of cake.

490
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,620
Li Ang also won an award for his new song.

491
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,660
I wrote his lyrics. I know he needs me.

492
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,860
Why are you moving my portrait?

493
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,620
B-Brother Yi, calm down.

494
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,160
President Ji told me to.

495
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,440
He said that the star wall rank would be linked to your performance.

496
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,280
You ranked the second last quarter.

497
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,520
The first is her.

498
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,440
Ji Chen.

499
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,640
You have to give me an explanation about this.

500
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,240
Qiao Yi, you are just in time.

501
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,140
I'm too busy with my new work, so I recruited a new executive talent manager,

502
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,320
Xiao Lin, say hi.

503
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,580
Qiao Yi, nice to meet you.

504
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,460
We can talk about it later.

505
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,100
Ji Chen. Why are you moving my portrait?

506
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,280
Qiu Qiu has been a star since the cat wedding half a year ago.

507
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,780
She has over ten endorsements.

508
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,260
So I set up an internal studio for Zhou Tian.

509
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,220
She is Qiu Qiu's talent manager and needs to cover the sports, entertainment, and pet industry.

510
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,520
While you have been resting for several months.

511
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,040
Qiu Qiu is naturally ranked ahead of you.

512
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,120
I'll be back to work right now. I'll be back in first place next week.

513
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,560
I have faith in you.

514
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,120
But President Ji worries that you may get drained after constant working.

515
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,160
He wants you to take a holiday. To relax a bit, and seek inspiration.

516
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,160
He has extended the deadline for your next book indefinitely.

517
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,900
Really?

518
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,020

519
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,320
Stay here. It's still early. It's still early.

520
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,440
How long do you plan to stay abroad?

521
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,100
It depends on...

522
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,460
Ji Nian, right?

523
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,100
The place where you train overseas is the same city where Ji Nian attends school.

524
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,900
Are you sure you didn't arrange this?

525
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,840
I'm sure. It's impossible for me to arrange it.

526
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,460
Don't worry, Brother-in-law.

527
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,480
I won't disturb Ji Nian in studying.

528
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll wait for her to graduate.

529
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm your wife's brother.

530
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,840
Yet I won't respond because you and Ji Nian are not legally married.

531
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,120
Can you two stop arguing over a name? It has been half a year.

532
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,480
If it were me...

533
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,060
Qiao Yi?

534
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,040
Qiao Yi!

535
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,740
I'm not. Miss, you have got the wrong person.

536
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,440
I can smell your perfume from one kilometer away.

537
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,460
And you bring these stinky rice noodles.

538
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,540
It has to be you.

539
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,140
What a nose.

540
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,500
I am just going abroad to travel.

541
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,160
I planned to tell you as soon as I get on the plane.

542
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,520
Abroad?

543
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,400
We don't have to dig everything out.

544
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,980
Got to catch my flight. I'm late already. Bye.

545
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,640
By the way,

546
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,340
I'll be away for a month.

547
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,900
Watch what you should do.

548
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,140
What should I do?

549
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,040
What do you think?

550
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,800
Rest assured. It's already on the drawing board.

551
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,720
 Channel Manager: dimghro

552
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,300
 Chief Segmenter: bjohnsonwong

553
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,360
Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian, which wedding bouquet do you prefer?

554
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,200
I chose one. Why are you asking again?

555
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,980
Yes, but it was three months ago. You were busy all the time.

556
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,560
Those flowers are way out of season.

557
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,460
Then dried flower. It won't be out of season. I got to go attend a meeting.

558
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:43,510
 Segmenters: dabyt787i, kitty100, nmelova, porkypine90_261

559
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,580
Start.

560
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:53,050
 Chief Editor: trangstar888

561
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:58,800
 Many thanks to other language moderators 
and their teams of subtitlers and editors.

562
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,960
Wait. Aren't we meeting with the client? What are we doing here?

563
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,950
I have told the client to delay for half an hour.

564
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,100
Let's finish this first. Come.

565
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,180
- This? 
 - Careful.

566
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,740

567
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,780
Civil affairs bureau?

568
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,700
To register as a couple?

569
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,220
But we haven't finished planning the wedding.

570
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,740
Forget it for now. Let's register first, and you'll be my legal wife.

571
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,240
We can talk about the wedding later. Come.

572
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,660
But this is a big deal. We need to talk it over with my parents.

573
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,840
What if they say no?

574
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,600
Rest assured. They are in my plan.

575
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,720
Slow down.

576
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,660
Tian Tian.

577
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,360
Dad, Mom, why are you here?

578
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,860
President Ji, here are Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

579
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,040
Daughter, I talked with your mom. This is a big deal.

580
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,920
You can't just register.

581
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,040
See? What did I say?

582
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,560
Yes. You can't just register. Got to have a baby after registration.

583
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,940
The wedding and other things can be delayed. Right?

584
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,220
- It can be combined with your baby's birthday party. 
 - Yes.

585
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,620
You are my parents. Why are you both on his side?

586
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,820
What outsider?

587
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,560
We four are a family now.

588
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,160
Yes!

589
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,120
No wonder you insisted on us wearing white shirts today.

590
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,620
Miss Zhou Tian, you'll be my legal wife in ten minutes.

591
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,500
And you will be Zhou Tian's legal husband soon.

592
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,000
What are we waiting for? Let's go get our photo taken. Let's go.

593
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,380
Go. Come on.

594
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,780
Let's go watch it.

595
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,030

596
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:17,090

597
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,260
Qiu Qiu?

598
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,340
I need you to choose a wedding bouquet.

599
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,240
You will attend our wedding next month.

600
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,180
Choose one for me. Come on.

601
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,960
Choose one between these two.

602
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,920

603
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,020
I think this one's better.

604
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,160
 They put off their wedding for so long.

605
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,660
 I don't think it will happen next month.

606
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,020
 Maybe not until I have a baby keeper.

607
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,460
 And my baby keeper can be the flower child at your wedding.

608
