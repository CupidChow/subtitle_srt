1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,930
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,830
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,330
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,430
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,600
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,780

17
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,870

18
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,580
I'd like to thank all the media coming to this event briefing.

19
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,180
We will officially respond to Qiao Yi's plagiarism incident that has been raging online.

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Now, Qiao Yi will make a formal response to that.

21
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,060
First of all, I'd have to say sorry to everyone,

22
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,660
to those who cared for me and loved me.

23
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,940
Sorry to keep you worrying for so long before I step out to respond about that.

24
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,300
Hello, everyone.

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,420
We all came here today for the truth,

26
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,430
so I brought the most important witness in it to the scene.

27
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,320
Whether Qiao Yi plagiarized or not,

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
you'll be able to judge it after hearing what he has to say.

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,800

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,200
He's Li Xiang's husband, the prototype of the role in the story.

31
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,720
Hello, I'm Han Sen.

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,320
Li Xiang is my wife.

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,220
After I communicated with my wife,

34
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,680
she agreed to let me announce the truth of the whole matter instead of her.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,440
My wife and I grew up together.

36
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,930
There used to be a sea of Douglas-firs trees near our village,

37
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,440
we had a protection policy about it,

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,020
but there was still excessive deforestation happening.

39
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,840
I almost lost my life once when I was trying to stop them.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,100
That's how the story began.

41
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,600
Li Xiang posted a short story about it, and then Qiao Yi's agent found us.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,920
She wanted to buy the copyright for the re-creation of the story for him.

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,880
We agreed and signed an agreement.

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,260
However, just a few days ago, she suddenly found Li Xiang,

45
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,540
gave her a sum of money and arranged for her to go abroad.

46
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,660
She asked Li Xiang to accuse Qiao Yi of plagiarism.

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,260
Qiao Yi, I'm so sorry.

48
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:25,300
I specifically declare here that I'm responsible for what I've said.

49
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,540
Words alone are not convictive. Do you have any evidence?

50
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,460
How can we believe you for your side of the story?

51
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,340
- That's right! 
 - That's it. Do you have any evidence?

52
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,920
- Show us the evidence. 
 - She has got the point there.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
- Where's your evidence? 
 - Show us about it.

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,190
Did you bring the original copyright agreement with you?

55
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,060
I looked for it but didn't find it.

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,620
Li Xiang said that Qiao Yi's previous agent bought it away.

57
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,980
Show us the evidence.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,920
- Yes! 
 - Show us about it.

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
Be patient, everyone.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,080
I'd like to show you a video.

61
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,400
 Hello, everyone. I'm the writer Feng Xue, and also the licensee of the story,

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
 Underwater Warrior, in Qiao Yi's new book.

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,000
 A year ago, Qiao Yi's agent, Miss Li Luxi found me.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,260
 She wanted me to license the story to Qiao Yi for re-creation.

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,440
 I agreed, and we signed the agreement.

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,700
 However, a few days ago, she found me again.

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,080
 But this time, she asked me to accuse Qiao Yi of plagiarism.

68
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,740
 And she told me that she had the agreements we had signed before,

69
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,260
 so Qiao Yi wouldn't be able to offer any evidence to clarify it.

70
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,700
 And she also promised to give me a sum of money for that.

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,480
 However, my principles are more important than money.

72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,140
 I don't want to get into trouble,

73
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,920
 so, I didn't think of telling the truth until President Ji came to me yesterday.

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,060
 Oh, I've had a habit of recording calls.

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,840
 So I have the complete recording between Miss Li Luxi and me.

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,360
All right. I got it. No problem.

77
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,660
President Ji, now that incident is perfectly resolved,

78
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,060
can you give me my resignation letter back now?

79
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,420
It was my fault.

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,120
I was short-sighted. And I shouldn't use my small-mindedness to judge you.

81
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,620
Please forget about my recklessness.

82
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,180
The witness I brought here was somewhat useful, right?

83
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,960
Although it wasn't me who solved it, I made a lot of effort.

84
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,060
As a talent manager, your integrity is the most important.

85
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,740
You must match your action to your word.

86
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,600
When I said that you'd regret it, what did you say?

87
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,520
I...

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,500
I said that I'd never regret it, or I'd be a puppy.

89
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,220
Fine. I get it.

90
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,040
Woof...

91
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,800
President Ji, did you see my sincerity?

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,360
Can you give me my resignation letter back now?

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,920
Don't get me wrong, I didn't promise you that.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,300
Are you fooling me?

95
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,060
But since you are so sincere, I'll think about it.

96
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,820
You!

97
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,960
I heard that you resigned.

98
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Director Kevin, I heard you and President Ji said you'd terminate the contract with Qiao Yi,

99
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
and the agreement was prepared, so I defended him against injustice.

100
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,580
I didn't expect I'd be hit in the face so quickly.

101
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,440
You didn't hear the whole thing.

102
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,740
 President Ji, Lucy sent this termination agreement to us.

103
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,800
 And President Chen deliberately called to talk about that.

104
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,480
 She's so impatient, even can't wait for days.

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,860
 I guess she'll definitely go to the briefing site tomorrow.

106
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,100
 I'll expose her on the spot.

107
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,680
The board did propose to contract termination with Qiao Yi, but President Ji never agreed to it.

108
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,460
Maybe someone deliberately exposed the news.

109
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,390
President Ji counterplotted it and deliberately created a situation

110
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,300
that we could do nothing about it.

111
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,440
That way, Lucy would think her plan was a success.

112
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,380
Only when she let her guard down could we quietly turn the tables.

113
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,160
President Ji has contributed another classic case of handling crisis PR this time.

114
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 The shocking reversal of Qiao Yi's plagiarism at the briefing this time was such a shock.

115
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,750
 EX, the brand that had given up cooperating with Qiao Yi,

116
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,940
 has announced a three-year contract with him.

117
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,720
 That's amazing!

118
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,380
 It shows that good prevails over evil.

119
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,580
 Justice will never be absent, but sometimes late.

120
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,820
 Yes. This has been trending on online...

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
Have you finished packing?

122
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,420
Right away. Sorry to bother you these days.

123
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,160
You did trouble me a bit but it's all right.

124
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,840
Luckily, he is finally innocent.

125
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,780
It's somewhat worthy of the torture I endured these days.

126
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,820
You endured the torture?

127
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,460
I was the one who suffered a lot, all right?

128
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,500
I could bear being exposed, suffering online bad comments, and losing endorsements.

129
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,530
But Lucy, I trusted her so much,

130
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,680
she actually stabbed me in the back!

131
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,000
That was too much!

132
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,940
Fortunately, I got a big heart. If it were you, you wouldn't be able to get over it.

133
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,980
Anyway, from today onwards, Lucy is just the past in my life.

134
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,880
Qiu Qiu, you know what?

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,560
Today, I thought I could do a better job than my boss,

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,300
but instead, I've misunderstood him.

137
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,960
So embarrassing.

138
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,820
Qiu Qiu, why are you getting fatter?

139
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,160
No. I have to talk to 1003 to get him to lower your food standards.

140
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,540
I want to talk to you seriously about Qiu Qiu's weight problem.

141
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,200
I was going to talk to you about that.

142
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
From tomorrow on, I'll cut its meal in half.

143
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
It has gained too much weight lately.

144
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,400
Good.

145
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,660
You don't seem to have a busy day.

146
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,260
The peacock thing is solved?

147
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,680
Yes. However, misfortune comes again to me.

148
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,980
Now the peacock is all right, I got into trouble.

149
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,360
I did something embarrassing.

150
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,140
I dropped a very important thing into the crocodile pool.

151
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,960
And I couldn't get it out.

152
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,900
So annoying.

153
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,980
Forget it. Let's convert sorrow into appetite, and have a feast.

154
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,940
It's unhealthy to eat late-night snacks.

155
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,380
It's also unhealthy to sleep hungry.

156
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Do you want to have instant noodles?

157
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,800
That's junk food.

158
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,660
Just a little bit of work, you'll be able to make a delicious noodle pancake.

159
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,140
I can teach you.

160
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,800
 First, prepare the material.

161
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,440
 A bag of instant noodles.

162
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,860
Thank you.

163
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,820
 That looks so delicate.

164
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,400
You have surpassed me a lot.

165
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,960
This is my first time trying this kind of instant noodles.

166
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,940
It's nice.

167
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,180
Of course, it is.

168
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,660
It took me most of my teenage years to develop it and make it so good.

169
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,840
I'll teach you to make other of my late-night snacks next time.

170
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm looking forward to it.

171
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,880
It's been a tough day.

172
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,460
Go to bed early after you finish it.

173
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,060
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

174
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,020
I finally got time to deal with you.

175
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,560
 Oh, my. He's coming.

176
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,140
 What should I do now?

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,540
Is anyone here?

178
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,740
Hello? Anyone here?

179
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,790

180
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,740
Hello, is anyone there?

181
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,520
 Our shop is not officially open yet.

182
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,580
I'm busy. Anything I can help you with?

183
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm looking for Ji Nian.

184
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,520
 Who?

185
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,840
Ji Nian, a shop assistant here.

186
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,120
You've got the wrong place.

187
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,300
We don't have anyone called that here.

188
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,400
Also, the second floor is not for customers,

189
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,480
do not just come up.

190
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,660
Oh, sorry. I'm leaving now.

191
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,760

192
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380

193
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600

194
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,840
 What are you doing? It's so late.

195
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,300
 Are you back from abroad secretly?

196
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,640
 Answer the phone.

197
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,160
 You're last chance to confess.

198
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,760
 What's the wrong with you?

199
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,140
 I just want to stay far away from you, why should I go back to suffer from you?

200
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,700
 I have a show tomorrow.

201
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,820
 Stop bothering me. Or I'll block you.

202
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,060

203
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,260
We did well in this battle.

204
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,760
But it was President Ji who turned the tide.

205
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,200
You did a good job too.

206
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,520
What's wrong? Why are you so lifeless?

207
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,200
I'm still in trouble.

208
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,820
President Ji didn't give me back the resignation letter.

209
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,120
Maybe the Human Resources  (HR)  Department will call me before going off duty

210
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,180
to tell me that I'm fired.

211
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,020
How could I be optimistic?

212
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,760
Then how about we go for a farewell dinner tonight?

213
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,340
Get away!

214
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,200
But you have made it up this time,

215
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,120
President Ji wouldn't be so cruel to you.

216
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,720
Hello, it's Zhou Tian, Literature Division Department.

217
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,680
HR Department?

218
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
All right. I got it.

219
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,260
What's wrong?

220
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,420
The HR Department asked me to go over

221
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,200
and said they had something to tell me.

222
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
Here comes the last straw.

223
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,060
Shut the crap!

224
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,120
Xia Chunqiu! Even my mom never hit me like that.

225
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
That's why you need it.

226
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll teach you a lesson in place of your mom.

227
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,140
You drove me into the corner.

228
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,260
So don't blame me for being brutal.

229
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,840
Zhou Tian, don't be reckless!

230
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,180
Let's go.

231
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,840

232
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,060
 President Ji, I want to talk to you.

233
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,120
 If you don't give me back

234
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,080
my resignation letter today,

235
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,500
I'll drag you down with me.

236
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,140
No...

237
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,320
It seems to be too tough.

238
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,860
As a dominating president,

239
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,800
President Ji should be able to be persuaded by the weak but not by force.

240
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
President Ji, I got aged parents,

241
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,320
and the job is just like my life.

242
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
If I lose the job,

243
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,800
then it's like taking my life.

244
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,640
Don't you think it's too ruthless to watch

245
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,000
my parents losing their daughter at their late years?

246
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,060
 President Ji. Be the bigger person, please.

247
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,480
 Let me off.

248
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,920
 My savior.

249
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,420
It's not good to act too miserably.

250
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,540
That makes me too humble.

251
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,080
What are you doing?

252
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,500
President Ji. Your table is dusty,

253
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,420
so I'm cleaning it for you.

254
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,820
In that case, a cleaner may be a better choice for you.

255
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,800
Cleaner?

256
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,700
President Ji, mercy, please.

257
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,800
The resignation was just out of impulse.

258
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Please don't make things difficult for a nobody.

259
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,400
HR hasn't had a conversation with you?

260
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
They did.

261
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,620
But I still want to make the final struggle.

262
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,980
Show me your sincerity then.

263
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,080
I, Zhou Tian, swear to the lamp,

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,320
as long as I'm allowed to stay,

265
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll work hard for sure.

266
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,380
I swear to submit to your direction,

267
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,640
and never act on my own from now on.

268
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,780
Is this sincere enough?

269
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,520
Not bad.

270
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,720
But as a talent manager, the core quality is honesty.

271
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,880
You have to do what you said.

272
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,240
What did you say to me when you submitted your resignation letter?

273
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,560
You put firmly you'd never regret it.

274
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,840
Everyone makes mistakes.

275
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,960
Please give me an opportunity.

276
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,580
Opportunities fall only to those who are ready for them.

277
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,600
But you... you've lost the chance.

278
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,540
President Ji, you are the kindest person in the world.

279
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,460
You should not sink to my level.

280
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,920
What do you think?

281
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,360
Well.

282
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,320
Your education background is not outstanding.

283
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,940
You have little experience in this aspect.

284
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,640
You disobeyed the direction of higher-ups and made mistakes several times.

285
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,360
It's hard to imagine what job you will find

286
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,660
if you leave our company.

287
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,440
President Ji, I admit that I'm a nobody.

288
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,100
But you should know that

289
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm a person with dignity.

290
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,800
Zhou Tian, HR wants to have a talk with you.

291
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,060
I'm on it.

292
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,480
President Ji, please take a look at Zhou Tian's full-time employee contract.

293
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,980
Full-time employee contract?

294
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,620
P-President Ji. I know what you just said to me

295
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,620
was a test of my resolution in this job.

296
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,080
Please rest assure. Since I joined Xing Yi, I never meant to leave.

297
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,880
I promise to devote myself to my work.

298
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,340
This is your so-called dignity?

299
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,780
It's the second time you asked for a resignation.

300
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,900
I fully see your resolution of leaving.

301
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,920
President Ji, I'm sorry.

302
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
I was impulsive and ignorant.

303
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,420
I didn't understand your instruction.

304
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,960
I think I'm too righteous, meticulous, and upright.

305
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,220
I'll make an effort to improve my sense of humor,

306
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,780
and follow your lead.

307
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,040
I'll make myself a talent of both high EQ and IQ,

308
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,920
and in full development.

309
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,070
- Hello? 
 - Please.

310
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,180
Hello, hi.

311
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,960
All right, I see.

312
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,440
Go get your new work card in HR.

313
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,520
Thank you, President Ji.

314
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,420
I'll definitely work hard, and make progress!

315
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,760
Then my resignation letter...

316
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,360
I'll keep it.

317
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,980
Its validity remains permanent.

318
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,260
But I feel uneasy if you keep it.

319
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,960
- But I do. 
 - I...

320
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,040
President Ji, the theme of NK is a champion's course of growth.

321
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Sports Division Department proposed a new plan for the spokesperson.

322
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,960
They want an international superstar.

323
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,280
But the time given by NK for filming

324
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,020
is in the range of this week.

325
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,360
People in the Sports Division Department have a wish to leave?

326
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,540
- What's wrong with them? 
 - None of your business. Focus on your own duty.

327
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,720
Wait, I... Qiao Yi has something to tell me.

328
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,320
I got to go. See you around, President Ji.

329
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,060
What the hell was going on?

330
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,340
Did President Ji mean

331
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,060
to disband the Sports Division Department?

332
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,980
No way.

333
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,720
What am I going to do if the department is disbanded?

334
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,760
Are you really fired?

335
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,620
Xiao Xia, are you acquainted with people in the Sports Division Department?

336
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,220
Can you make some inquiries for me?

337
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,900

338
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,460
Hi, Xiao Xia. 
  - Hi, Zhou Tian. I've got it.

339
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,180
The Sports Division Department is negotiating the contract extension with NK Group.

340
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,500
NK is in rapid development in recent years.

341
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,080
 They want an athlete as the spokesperson who is internationally famous.

342
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,760
But they are not happy with the candidates recommended.

343
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,420
Why? So many athletes are on the list.

344
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,120
 Because the new series NK will launch is aimed at intelligent outdoor sports.

345
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,820
Such sports started late in our country,

346
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,720
so there are no suitable candidates.

347
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,000
 But if we fail to meet their need,

348
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,040
we'll miss the client.

349
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,180
 Intelligent outdoor sports.

350
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,580
 Zhang Hao may help with this.

351
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,620
- Tian Tian. 
 - Tian Tian.

352
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,580
Tian Tian!

353
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,460
- I miss you so much. 
 - Do you miss me?

354
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,560
Tian Tian.

355
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,120
I saw your performance just now.

356
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,260
I haven't seen you for a while, but you made so much progress.

357
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,680
We were discussing last night how to celebrate your birthday
next week.

358
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,820
But surprisingly, you came today.

359
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,860
Tian Tian, shouldn't you be working now?

360
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,780
I want to talk about some business with Senior Zhang Hao.

361
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,080
And I dropped by to see you all.

362
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,040
- Here, I brought you... 
 - Thank you!

363
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,780
some healthy drinking. Feel free to drink.

364
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,920
- It's good. 
 - I'll talk to you later.

365
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,020
I'm going to talk to Senior Zhang Hao.

366
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,620
Tian Tian, Senior Zhang Hao is in the reception room of the office area.

367
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,040
A company wanted to sign a contract with him.

368
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
That company is a big deal.

369
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,840
I heard from the coach that they came with a contract.

370
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,220
I see.

371
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,700

372
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,420
Stop!

373
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,960
You cannot sign the contract!

374
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
What are you doing here?

375
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,520

376
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,100
Xing Yi?

377
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,940
P-President Ji.

378
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,800
Senior, what's going on there?

379
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,440
 I feel a murderous aura.

380
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,080
President Ji, I've already said my piece.

381
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,140
If you cannot meet my requirement,

382
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,900
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,960
W-What is that?

384
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:24,460

385
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,330
 Except for your compensation, feel free to tell me what you want.

386
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,440
 If it's to my ability, I will do my best.

387
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,560
 I don't care much about the compenstation.

388
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,500
 What else do you want?

389
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,580
 I only have one request.

390
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,520
 Xing Yi, right?

391
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,920
 One of your new employee is named Zhou Tian.

392
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,220
 Transfer her to the Sports Division Department.

393
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,160
 I've got no idea what your relationship is with her.

394
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,160
 But I'm sure the answer is no.

395
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,460
 The professional field should be left to professionals.

396
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,260
 She used to be an athlete.

397
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,000
 Sports is her speciality.

398
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,540
 Even though she's not an athlete anymore,

399
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,820
 she should start from the Sports Division Department,

400
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,060
 but not the Literature Division Department.

401
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,960
 She can also realize her growth in the Literature Division Department

402
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,500
 before choosing a suitable position.

403
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,380
 It's not contradictory.

404
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,280
Senior.

405
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,580
This is my only request.

406
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

407
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,880
You can't take advantage of the personnel assignment of our company.

408
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,780
We have our rules.

409
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,640
Besides, Zhou Tian's current talent and ability

410
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,100
do not meet the qualification of the Sports Division Department.

411
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,280
In that case, I have to say sorry.

412
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,880
Zhou Tian got the offer as a performing arts talent manager at the very beginning.

413
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
No one ever forced her.

414
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,440
In addition, she's an adult.

415
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,060
She has the right to choose her position.

416
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,780
None of us could make the decision for her.

417
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,820
Mr. Zhang, I'm look forward to our partnership.

418
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,800
I advise you to think twice about it.

419
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,780
Looking forward to hearing from you.

420
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Senior. I know you're doing this for my own good.

421
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,640
I've been dreaming of entering the Sports Division Department.

422
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,640
But I know I'm indeed deficient in talent and ability.

423
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,000
But I will follow in everyone's footsteps as far as I can.

424
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
I'll enter the department with my own capacity,

425
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,820
but not exchange it by contract.

426
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,460
Senior. The contract really means a lot to Xing Yi,

427
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,000
and also you.

428
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,020
You shouldn't give up such a good partnership for me.

429
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,420
The ad has to be filmed this week, right?

430
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,920
I promise you to be the spokesperson of NK.

431
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,920
I hope you can negotiate a partnership with me as Xing Yi's sports agent one day.

432
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Thank you, Senior.

433
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,580
Hope we'll have a pleasant cooperation, Mr. Zhang.

434
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,620
Have a seat.

435
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,120
 Bravo! Sports Division Department is safe.

436
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,200
Oh, Senior. I brought you your favorite milk tea.

437
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,260
Congratulations to you!

438
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,800
Thanks.

439
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,640
President Ji, would you like to try this?

440
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,640
Fine, I'll drink it.

441
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,800
It doesn't taste sweet.

442
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,060
Tian Tian, you grabbed the wrong one.

443
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,880
This one is sugar-free.

444
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,220
Here.

445
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,240
Zhou Tian!

446
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,820
Be careful about Helicobacter Pylori.

447
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,340
It's highly infectable and may cause stomach cancer.

448
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,700
The main route of transmission is saliva.

449
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,780

450
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,780
Look how knowledgeable President Ji is!

451
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,420
You know so many things.

452
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,520
Awesome!

453
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,200
Hi, Coach.

454
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,280
Okay. I got it.

455
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm sorry, President Ji.

456
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,360
I'm afraid our cooperation will not make it.

457
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,360
What ill luck.

458
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,560
Senior's schedule for the competition has been tweaked a bit.

459
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,500
The timing conflicts with the filming of the ad.

460
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,680
No idea if he could get the coach's approval to take a half-day off.

461
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,140
But my experience told me he couldn't.

462
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,420
President Ji, you're so calm.

463
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,800
Have you thought of any plan B?

464
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,920
Nope.

465
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,780
Why aren't you anxious about that?

466
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,745
In the worst situation, I'll dissolve the Sports Division Department.

467
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:40,305
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

468
00:38:40,305 --> 00:38:44,365

487
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:23,575
♫  Shine for you  ♫

488
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:32,275
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

489
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:36,337
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

490
00:40:36,337 --> 00:40:40,888
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

491
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:45,975
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

492
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:50,259
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

493
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:54,505
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

494
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:59,231
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

495
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:09,235
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

496
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:18,435
♫  Shine for you  ♫
