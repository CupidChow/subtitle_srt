1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,630
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:34,360
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:49,000
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,360
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,330
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,690
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,800
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,820

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,420

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,580
What's its name?

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,580
Qiu Qiu.

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,760
 Qiu Qiu?

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
 Zhou Tian?

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,540
 Come on, Qiu Qiu.

22
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,140
 Let's go.

23
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,080

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,760
Zhou Tian.

25
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,280
Sunday.

26
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,820
I even didn't think about this.

27
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,460

28
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,820

29
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,300

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,460
You are not supposed to leave.

31
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,460
As a gentleman, you can't break the appointment.

32
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,880
And, she's a lady.

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,380
Lady? Zhou Tian?

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,040
Forget about it.

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
She regards me as an unlovely,

36
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,500
unhandsome, and even a little cold-blooded animal. She must be crazy.

37
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,520
You must keep the appointment.

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,840
What are you doing?

39
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,180

40
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm going to delete her,

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,040
and end this ridiculous thing right now.

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,700
Aren't you expecting the meeting with her?

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,420
Imagination is beautiful, but the reality is horrible.

44
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,600
I see.

45
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
You're afraid that you will fall in love with her,

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,320
if you stay with her for too long.

47
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,020
I will never fall in love with a flippant and disobedient woman

48
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,260
who almost knocked me down and unconditionally

49
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,720
challenged my tolerance.

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,600
You are temperamental and domineering.

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,860
As an employee, she just tries hard to survive.

52
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,800
She didn't mean to knock you down.

53
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,360
You think she is disobedient because you are always self-centered

54
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,480
and have no sense of team spirit.

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,080
She's just trying hard to do her job well.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,600
She's doing her own job.

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,820
Sunday is Zhou Tian.

58
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,980
And I am the crocodile in her zoo.

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,800
But I even teased myself with her.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,020
That's your problem, not Zhou Tian's.

61
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,820
Do you like her?

62
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,860
Yes. I do like her.

63
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,280
She's warm, generous, kind, and considerate.

64
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,840
She often inspires me suddenly.

65
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,380
She let me think carefully about my relationship with Ji Nian.

66
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,700
I think she is a reliable friend.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
So, you like her as a friend. That's good.

68
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,500
But I'm not sure if we will have a new relationship in the future.

69
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,780
The person who has a good relationship with her is you, 1003, not me, Ji Chen.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,380
Aren't you just 1003?

71
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,860
She just gets used to your look when you are working.

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,820
She has never seen your look in daily life.

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,000
Just have a try. She will accept you.

74
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,220
Don't flatter yourself.

75
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,580
She will never like you, because she hates me.

76
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,780
She may hate me, but it's not up to you.

77
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,800
It's up to her.

78
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,280
Fine. I will make you hopeless.

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,300
It's already 12:30.

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,780
Did anything happen to him?

81
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:54,640
♫  Hands up, everybody, hands up, hey!  ♫ 
 ♫  Hands up, everybody, hands up  ♫

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,760
♫  Come inna di dance and you haffi dance up  ♫

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,210
♫  When di hear Reggae music and you put yuh hands up  ♫

84
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,740
♫  And you smoke di ganja and you put yuh hands up  ♫

85
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,000
♫  Everybody...  ♫

86
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,120
P-President Ji. Why are you here?

87
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,680
I have a business appointment.

88
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Business appointment?

89
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,000
Here?

90
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,040
Hello, Sir. What can I do for you?

91
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,220
My friend and I want to help you with the dogs and cats charity.

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,340
I'd like to offer 10,000 yuan first.

93
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Miss.

94
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,420
We are not...

95
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,080
President Ji. My friend is coming.

96
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,580
And you are sitting in his seat.

97
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,900
He hasn't come yet.

98
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,800
But he will be here soon.

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,340
He can take the seat when he comes.

100
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,400
 Hey, why are you so shameless?

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,100
 I have refused you so obviously.

102
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,260
 It's not working time now.

103
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,000
 Please don't let me see your ugly capitalist face.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,980
 Get out of here.

105
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,340
What are you doing?

106
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,700
I...

107
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,560
President Ji, I...

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,880
Please drink some water.

109
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,060
Here. Enjoy yourself.

110
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,900
 Indeed, my cat behaves exactly like me.

111
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,120
 Hope he will leave as soon as possible.

112
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,460
 Don't disturb my meeting with 1003.

113
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,620
You won't suffer any losses. Eat some food.

114
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,120
No, thanks, President Ji. I'm waiting for my friend.

115
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,240
What time is your appointment?

116
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Twelve.

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,340
He's almost an hour late.

118
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,180
You should ask him if he will still come.

119
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,760
What friend is it?

120
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,900
Boyfriend?

121
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Nope.

122
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,260
Is it a online friend?

123
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,040
President Ji. This should not be a part of your business.

124
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,860
So, I'm right.

125
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I should care about my employee's daily life.

126
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,300
After all, in this big world, there are all kinds of people. And even liars.

127
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,320
I don't want you to be deceived, which may affect your work.

128
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,920
Don't worry, President Ji.

129
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,420
I know my friend very well.

130
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,700
He is not a liar.

131
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,280
If you really have so much time,

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,860
you should care more about others.

133
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
You have never seen him.

134
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,840
You can't judge him so carelessly.

135
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,660
The more you expect, the more disappointed you will be.

136
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,940
He's my friend. I know him well.

137
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,420
He's not capable like you, who has a good career.

138
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,760
But that guy is sensible,

139
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,080
warm, and loves life.

140
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,200
President Ji. If you don't have any other requests,

141
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,140
please go back to have a rest.

142
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,180
It's the weekend today.

143
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,520
You don't have to supervise my work, do you?

144
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,740
It's so late.

145
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,820
He may not be here today.

146
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,420
We made an appointment. I believe he will come.

147
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,140
But he doesn't come.

148
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,820
I will wait.

149
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,540

150
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,460

151
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,300
What's wrong?

152
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,420
Did he break the appointment?

153
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,400

154
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,820
President Ji. Enjoy yourself.

155
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,580
I have to go.

156
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,100
 Why is there such an annoying species in the world?

157
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,800
 I submitted the resignation letter.

158
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,960
 I can finally get rid of that annoying guy.

159
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,380
 If there is no dream, there will be no life.

160
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,880
 I love life.

161
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,120
 So I have to keep enduring you.

162
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,140
I...

163
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,960
Is the crocodile really so annoying?

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,540
What's wrong with 1003?

165
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,380
Why doesn't he reply to my message?

166
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,520
Qiu Qiu. Are you worried about him?

167
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,380
Yes.

168
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,860
You are worried.

169
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,840
I will help you ask him.

170
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440

171
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,060
Well.

172
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,180
No. Calm down.

173
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,200
Sorry.

174
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,220
There was an emergency to Huskie. And I left my phone at home.

175
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,940
So, I couldn't reply to your message.

176
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,160
So, it was your dog who stalled you.

177
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
It doesn't matter.

178
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,300
I thought you had met an accident.

179
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,560
It's good that you are fine.

180
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,200
Did you get angry?

181
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,860
In fact, the crocodile made trouble again.

182
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,380
Fortunately, you didn't come.

183
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,000
Or the meeting would be unpeaceful.

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,340
Anyway, I'm glad that you are fine.

185
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,340
Tomorrow, I will go with the peacock for an exhibition.

186
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,300
I have to go. Bye.

187
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,660
Qiu Qiu. He's fine.

188
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,860

189
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,280
 Look. She thinks you like that.

190
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,980
You should stop chatting with her.

191
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,400
In her eyes, you are just a cold-blooded crocodile.

192
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,100
Do you know what a crocodile is?

193
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,780
A kind of animal being watched by visitors in the zoo.

194
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,900
You are not better than me.

195
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,180
You called her Huskie.

196
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,780
She calls me like that, because she doesn't know me well.

197
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,880
I will give her time to know me,

198
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,700
because I like her.

199
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,820
 I like her?

200
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,280
Qiao Yi. Let's talk about the working plan in the next half year.

201
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,940
You published a new book every year these years.

202
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,080
All of them are popular.

203
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,280
I heard that some of them have been revised as scripts of dramas.

204
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,680
 - God bless me.   
- Could you tell us something?

205
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,460
 Have everything go well today and no accidents.

206
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,100
"Silent Cry" is going to start filming soon.

207
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,240
I will participate in the production.

208
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,120
 Why didn't I know this?

209
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,480
Could you tell us some details?

210
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,180
I will be the scriptwriter of the play.

211
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,960
Excuse me. We have more work to do next. Sorry.

212
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,580
- Brother Yi.
- Brother Yi.

213
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,540
I know he's always dissatisfied with the revised script.

214
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,160
But I didn't expect...

215
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,400
Zhou Tian. You were too careless.

216
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,600
Don't you know once he has the revision right, he will be able to decide everything?

217
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,620
If they deny it in public, we will be embarrassed.

218
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,720
- What should we do? 
 - What should we do?

219
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,440
You were on the spot, but you didn't stop him. What do you think we should do?

220
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,300
Make the best of a mistake.

221
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,740
I get it.

222
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,960
President Ji, do you mean we should invest in a net play named "Silent Cry"?

223
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,980
Then we invite Qiao Yi to be the scriptwriter.

224
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,500
But, will Qiao Yi agree to that?

225
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,600
He said this just because

226
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
he dislikes the revision.

227
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,240
Zhou Tian, take Qiao Yi to see the director on Monday,

228
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,880
and talk about the script.

229
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,280
Then there will be no problem.

230
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,580
President Ji, you are always wise.

231
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,200
You always have a good idea when we need it.

232
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,540
You solved such a complicated matter in an instant.

233
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,600
It's cool.

234
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,320
They still needed thirty percent of the investment.

235
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,100
I asked my friend to invest in it.

236
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,480
Besides, other investors are also not satisfied with the script.

237
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,260
Now, the writer, Qiao Yi, wants to have a try, so the investors are expecting his work.

238
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,980
The director can't have any objections.

239
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,680
Got it.

240
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,280
I can't understand why every one of you is so nervous.

241
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,440
Is my work really so bad?

242
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,360
It's not bad, is it?

243
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,800
You are not a rookie in this circle.

244
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Do you really think it's easy to change a scriptwriter when everything is read?

245
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,280
Of course, I know it's not easy.

246
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,920
But, I have Ji Chen.

247
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,780
He's my talent manager. He has to solve all my problems.

248
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,920
Otherwise, why should I hire a talent manager?

249
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,140
Well, I'm hungry. Please cook some food for me.

250
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,420
Cook it yourself.

251
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,920
Do you think I can't do anything without you?

252
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,260
I'm going to order takeout.

253
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,680
But you forget that my house is very remote.

254
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,640
I don't even think you can get your takeout before you starve to death.

255
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,220
Then let me starve to death. I'll die in your house.

256
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,080
Then I'll always stay here as a ghost.

257
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,220
It's boring.

258
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm going to go cook some food.

259
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,060
There are so many ingredients.

260
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,940
Stay here if you don't want to eat.

261
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,240
You're so mean.

262
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,140
Please cook me some rice noodles.

263
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,660
How is it?

264
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,740
We'll take Qiao Yi to see the director next Monday.

265
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,060
Is that so easy?

266
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,100
The boss is so cool.

267
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,380
But the next Monday is your birthday.

268
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,040
Really?

269
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,580
You reserved seats with Chuan Style Restaurant.

270
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,940
Yes. I reserved it half a month in advance.

271
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,760
Will it take a long time to talk about the script with the director?

272
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,420
- What time is the appointment? 
 - Two in the afternoon.

273
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,560
If you talk fast, it will be finished before five.

274
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,060
It won't take too long for the first time.

275
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,860
Great.

276
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,520
But... Qiao Yi may make trouble.

277
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
Could you finish your words at once?

278
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,380
But he may not really make trouble.

279
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,380
However, Qiao Yi is a man of high demands, just a little,

280
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,020
especially when it comes to scripts.

281
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,880
When his last novel was revised to be the script,

282
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,260
he fired four scriptwriters.

283
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,620
- Four? 
 - Yes!

284
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,600
So, you have to gently remind him in advance

285
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,580
that he should at least respect the director's ideas.

286
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,060
Brother Hao, I'll head home if there is nothing else.

287
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,260
Fine. Take care.

288
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,700
Gigi. It's a little late.

289
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,560
Go home and rest early.

290
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,840
Brother Zhang Hao. Look. I am a girl.

291
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,740
The shop closes at 10 every night.

292
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,660
I have to go home late every day.

293
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't you think it's very dangerous?

294
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,220
I'll drive you back.

295
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,800
No bother.

296
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,100
In fact, the second floor is not occupied.

297
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,080
Can I live upstairs?

298
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,980
Besides, I've been short of money recently.

299
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,300
And I can guard the shop at night.

300
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,680
What do you think?

301
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,580
But the room upstairs is messy and dirty.

302
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,300
It's not suitable for a girl to live.

303
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,420
It's all right.

304
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,540
When you were not here, I've cleaned the room.

305
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,960
I also moved my luggage in.

306
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,760
Now I just need to tidy them up.

307
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,800
You already did it before you asked me.

308
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,480
All right. You can live here but take care.

309
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,820
Thank you, Brother Zhang Hao. You are always so nice.

310
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,900
However, you can't always be so nice to everyone.

311
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,640
Or the people who care about you will think you don't pay enough attention to them.

312
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,380
- Really? 
 - Of course!

313
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,820
I read this on the Internet. Now I share it with you.

314
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm going upstairs to tidy up my things.

315
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,880
All right.

316
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,640
 In that case,

317
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,280
 I should be nicer to Zhou Tian.

318
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,580
 Do it from her birthday.

319
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,640
 Hello, Brother Yi.

320
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,260
I will arrive in about ten minutes.

321
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,140
Are you ready?

322
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,240
All right, okay.

323
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,820
Should we go there a little earlier?

324
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,560
Then it will show our dedication to work and respect to the director.

325
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,120
All right.

326
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,220
Get everything done before dinner.

327
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,840
Qiao Yi.

328
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,120
Both the novel and movie are art to tell stories.

329
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,280
Is there any difference between the ways they perform?

330
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm just a rookie. I don't know so much.

331
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,000
Could you teach me?

332
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
You have chosen the right person.

333
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,340
About ten of my novels have been revised to make TV series and movies.

334
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,680
Indeed, they are both art to tell stories,

335
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,760
but there is a big difference.

336
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
Writers, scriptwriters, and directors have different jobs.

337
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,380
 He is not as stubborn as I thought.

338
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,640
 He knows the common sense.

339
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,580
But you have to know that the reason why my novels are so popular is that

340
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,700
I focus on the moods of characters and the artistic conception.

341
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,160
Therefore, I have to insist on these two points.

342
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,220
Then I won't fail my readers.

343
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,760
The summary meeting for this week and the report on industry information are arranged for tomorrow afternoon.

344
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,700
The headquarters have sent us the running principles.

345
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,900
Five hundred pages in total. We haven't translated it yet.

346
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,220
- That's Roh Cake.
- Yes.

347
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,060
(It's expensive but very delicious.)

348
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,180
Who sent her this?

349
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,760
It's her fellow brother.

350
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,800
Does he want to chase her?

351
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,820
Xia. You are Zhou Tian's close friend.

352
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,000
Tell us about their relationship.

353
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,360
According to my observation,

354
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,800
they keep a special feeling for each other.

355
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,260
But nobody confesses it first.

356
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,520
It seems that Zhang Hao takes the initiative.

357
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,280
That's the ice cream cake
Zhou Tian likes very much.

358
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,140
Every time when she is unhappy, she will buy it.

359
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,260
She said it could cheer her up.

360
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,840
Look at the huge bunch of flowers. Is he going to propose?

361
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,180
No way. He would come in person if he proposed.

362
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,540
Well. He spent so much money buying such a huge bunch of flowers.

363
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,840
What else does he want to do?

364
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,800
President Ji.

365
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
- President Ji. 
 - President Ji.

366
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,340
President Ji.

367
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,380
Where is this cake from?

368
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,680
It's Zhou Tian's birthday today.

369
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,880
Who sent such unhealthy food on her birthday?

370
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,480
Where is she?

371
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,940
She went with Yi to set the makeup.

372
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,660
Since she's not here, you can share the cake.

373
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,780
We don't have her permission.

374
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,960
If we eat her cake, it will be impolite.

375
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,780
Should we put it in the refrigerator?

376
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,360
The ice cream cake is so huge.

377
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,240
It will take a large space in the refrigerator. But what a waste if we put it here.

378
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
Zhou Tian is generous. She won't mind it.

379
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,800
Just share it.

380
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,500
Don't worry, President Ji. I often buy cakes in that shop.

381
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
They always put a lot of ice on with cakes.

382
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
There won't be any problem if we put it for four or five hours.

383
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,820
Yeah.

384
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,240
You like cakes in that shop very much.

385
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,720
From tomorrow on, I will buy you three cakes every day.

386
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,060
Thank you, President Ji. But you don't have to buy so many.

387
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,760
You must finish them all.

388
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,020
Let me take a photo and send it to Zhou Tian.

389
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Give me the flowers.

390
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,660
Here.

391
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,980
Her fellow brother, Zhang Hao, is so considerate.

392
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,120
President Ji.

393
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,540
Are you bored?

394
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,020
The running principles. Let her translate it.

395
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,380
Yes.

396
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,160
Five hundred pages in a foreign language. Finish them before getting off work.

397
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,400
Five hundred pages. Today?

398
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,500
You shouldn't have provoked him.

399
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,840
Go for it.

400
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,040
How did I provoke him?

401
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,060
It's actually Zhou Tian's birthday.

402
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,220
Does her birthday have anything to do with me?

403
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,400
A fortune-teller told my mom that

404
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,980
my future wife was born on this day.

405
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,240
But I don't know what time Zhou Tian was born.

406
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,180
Are you also bored?

407
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,920
Help her do the translation work.

408
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,860

409
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920

410
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,580

411
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,900

412
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,600

413
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,760
He said I didn't understand the movie.

414
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,580
But he doesn't even understand "Silent Cry".

415
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,440
How annoying!

416
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,880
He doesn't even understand what the novel says.

417
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,160
How can he be the director? It's ridiculous.

418
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,900
As the saying goes, there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes.

419
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,500
It means that your novel is great.

420
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,760
Calm down. Look.

421
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,860
Have a rest first. I'll talk to the director.

422
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,360

423
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,840
 The ice-cream cake Senior Zhang Hao sent you in the morning.

424
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,260
Forgive me. I just have time to reply to your message.

425
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,900
 He's so nice.

426
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,460
 He never forgets it every year.

427
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,900
 How is your situation?

428
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,240
 Can you come back before dinner?

429
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,960
 I'm not sure.

430
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,160
 But the cake can't hold so long.

431
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,260

432
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,380
Hello, Miss.

433
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,440
This is the director's new idea. Please let Qiao Yi read it.

434
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,420
All right.

435
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,120
And it's about dinner time.

436
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,900
Should we send food to Qiao Yi?

437
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,920
Do we have to continue this after dinner?

438
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,900
We're just afraid that he may be hungry.

439
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,900
We'd better be quick and finish this before dinner.

440
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,360
If he feels hungry, I will ask the driver to buy him food.  Thank you so much.

441
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,900
All right. Please excuse me.

442
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,960
- Well, thanks. 
 - It's nothing.

443
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,560
 I want to go back to eat the cake.

444
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,780
 Hope there won't be any accident when they are discussing work.

445
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,360
 Most importantly. I must eat the food in Chuan Style Restaurant.

446
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,680
 I've been expecting this for three months.

447
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,180
 Please God, it's my birthday.

448
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,120
 Please let me enjoy the food there.

449
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,860
Is it your birthday today?

450
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,880
Yes.

451
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,800
- Happy birthday. 
 - Thanks.

452
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,640
Oh. When is your birthday?

453
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,340
The first of January.

454
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,560
You share the same birthday with the crocodile.

455
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,080
What a coincidence.

456
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,700
Oh. Do you like ice cream cake?

457
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,100
Not really.

458
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,580
When I was a child,

459
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,380
I couldn't often eat desserts in the sports team.

460
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,660
I could only eat them on my birthday.

461
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,220
So, I always expected my birthday.

462
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,160
I thought that I could go home

463
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,140
and spent my birthday with my parents this year.

464
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,940
I could eat the noodles my dad cooked.

465
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,660
But I can't eat anything,

466
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,600
and have to work overtime.

467
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,400
Why don't you take them here?

468
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,960
I go to work early and come back late.

469
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,940
If they come here and see me working until midnight every day,

470
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,480
they will be sad and lecture me.

471
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,740
I'd rather not.

472
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,300
Oh, you said the noodles your dad cooked are very special.

473
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,780
That's right. The noodles my dad cooked are all made by himself.

474
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,620
There will be pork fat, scallions, fried garlic,

475
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,880
one soft-boiled egg, and four slices of luncheon meat.

476
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
Every year, he would bring it to me

477
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,300
I would see the noodles.

478
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,400
But I haven't eaten it for many years.

479
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,220
I can only see them on my phone.

480
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,460
What? He wants me to write according to his outline.

481
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,480
Are you kidding me?

482
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,160
Did you eat the noodles this year?

483
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,520
Qiao Yi, this is the director's habit.

484
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,660
He needs to control the script of every movie.

485
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,300
Or he can't make the best movie.

486
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,940
If he doesn't like my work,

487
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,660
he can give up on it.

488
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,860
Qiao Yi!

489
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,680
Answer the phone, Kevin.

490
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You can leave if you don't want to.

491
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,000
But this is my novel.

492
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,780
I must be responsible for my novels and their derivative products.

493
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,700
You must be responsible for your novels. And I must be responsible for my movies.

494
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,320
If you don't respect the difference between novels and movies,

495
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,380
though you are the original author of the novel,

496
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,520
I will refuse to work with you.

497
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,340
Great. I also refuse to work with the director who doesn't respect the original work.

498
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Qiao Yi.

499
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,340
Director, we are just here to talk casually.

500
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,300
It was going well when we arrived.

501
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,560
Why...

502
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,040
It comes to my movie. Neither the famous scriptwriter nor the original author can butt in it.

503
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,500
I have my own creative ideas.

504
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,140
That's respect to the movie art.

505
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,680
If he refuses to respect it,

506
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
I also refuse to make the movie.

507
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,560
She's gone. What are you waiting for?

508
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,460
I'm waiting for you.

509
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,460
Hey, today is her birthday.

510
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,020
But you asked her to do so much work.

511
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,740
I didn't know it.

512
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,400
You know it now.

513
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,540
Won't you do anything?

514
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,940
Go to find her. Bring her some food.

515
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,320
Ridiculous.

516
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,140
That's just an employee's birthday.

517
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,980
Why should I do something?

518
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,700
All right.

519
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,140
If you refuse, don't regret it.

520
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,220
 It's just a birthday.

521
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,800
I also spent my last birthday working overtime.

522
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,740
Why is it different when it's her birthday?

523
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,280
President Ji, bad news. Something happened to Qiao Yi.

524
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,200
He is arguing with the director.

525
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,700
Really?

526
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,880
Great.

527
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,920
Well, President Ji. I was too anxious just now. Did I...

528
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,540
I heard it very clearly. Let's go there.

529
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,680
Qiao Yi is arguing with the director.

530
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,280
Bring some gifts for them. Get ready.

531
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, I see.

532
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,160
President Ji, you are so wise.

533
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,420
Should we take the chairman's wine or the herb President Jiang Hanyi sent you?

534
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,960
Director Li Han likes Sichuan cuisine.

535
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,740
Listen. Go to the restaurant named Chuan Style,

536
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,040
and pack up all the popular dishes.

537
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,060
But, President Ji. The restaurant is too far.

538
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,880
If we pack up the food there...

539
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,200
Make sense.

540
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,460
Listen. Go to Chuan Style Restaurant directly, and take the chef over.

541
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,280
Is there any problem?

542
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,780
No problem.

543
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,240
Let's go.

544
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,440
I'll call Zhou Tian first, and tell her we are going there.

545
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,560
She needs to keep Qiao Yi there.

546
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,740
Director Kevin.

547
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,100
Are you and President Ji going to find Qiao Yi later?

548
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,040
- What's the matter? 
 - Could you please take this cake to Zhou Tian?

549
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,640
The ice can't keep it for too long. It is going to melt.

550
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,540
We are busy now. Forget the cake.

551
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,140
But it will be wasteful if it melts.

552
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,420
Or I'll call a deliveryman.

553
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,140
Give it to me.

554
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,960
I said to give the cake to me.

555
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,180
Xiao Xia is right. We can't waste it.

556
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,040
Give it to me.

557
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:55,050

558
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,560

559
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,960
Turn on the air conditioner. Warm air.

560
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,340
President Ji, heating mode in this weather?

561
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,040
I feel cold.

562
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,440
All right.

563
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,560
President Ji. Are you sick?

564
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,160
Are you drained because of overworking?

565
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,060
It's all my fault.

566
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,740
Turn the heat up to full blast.

567
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,740

568
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,169
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

569
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:49,169
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

570
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:53,769

574
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:12,599

575
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,809

576
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:22,439

00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:26,039
