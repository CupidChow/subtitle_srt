1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,430
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,330
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,430
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,790
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,800
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,740

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,170

18
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,660
Don't hesitate.

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,490
You didn't come last time,

20
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,090
so you can make it up to me today.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,040
But I have a business dinner tonight.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,580
Tomorrow, then.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,710
Tomorrow...

24
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,430
You said you were not busy.

25
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,380
Yes. But just for now, at this moment.

26
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,250
This minute.

27
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,520
Fine.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,280
Choose a date you are available.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,060

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,730
How about...

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,650
after this day?

32
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,120
 I bet he has some problem.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,560
Stop staring at this. Don't waste time.

34
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Tell the truth to Zhou Tian before she unmasks you.

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,660
Otherwise, you'll suffer.

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,990
I have sent Kevin to do the preparations.

37
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll tell her my identity and confess my feelings for her at this weekend.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,830
Zhou Tian will be moved and feel grateful.

39
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,110
She'll understand my intentions and concerns recently.

40
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,930
Perfect.

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,430
Would it make me too arrogant?

42
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,020
It's my attitude as a man.

43
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,220
Don't have Zhou Tian expose your identity before the weekend.

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,200
Or she'll think you were emotionally cheating on her.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,520
Then I'll confess to her today.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,030
Make sure she has no idea

47
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,920
we are the same person before that.

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,950
Director Kevin, are you making tea?

49
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,480
- Let me do it for you. 
 - No.

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,580
It's all right. Let me do it.

51
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,490
Tell me, what do you want?

52
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,520
You deserve to be the mere CEO's assistant of Xing Yi.

53
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,320
How remarkable you are.

54
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,890
There's a petty thing that I want to learn from you.

55
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,380
I happened to see

56
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,520
you took a cat to the pet store the other day.

57
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,680
You saw that? Then?

58
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,530
I remember that you said you hated cats.

59
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,850
You looked after the cat for an important person.

60
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,140
Do I know that person as well?

61
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,820
Why bother to ask so much? Does it have to do with the work?

62
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,570
Sure.

63
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,080
I guess the person is both crucial to you and Xing Yi.

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,650
Am I right?

65
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,350
I do have some experience in keeping cats.

66
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,490
So I want to put up some ideas for you.

67
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,600
I knew you weren't harboring good intentions.

68
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,580
What a pity. You would never snatch the cat from me.

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,260
He's such a self-centered man,

70
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,880
but he asked me to take care of his cat.

71
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,030
What does it stand for?

72
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,620
It's his trust to me.

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,350
He thinks highly of me. And we are intimate mates.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,720
- So the man, is really Mr... 
 - Kevin,

75
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,740
I didn't even know you had a girlfriend, and you kept a cat.

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,550
Don't have them affect your work.

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Isn't the person a man?

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
What's going on, Director Kevin?

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
He lives with a man?

80
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,600
No idea.

81
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,620
 Incoming dangerous aura.

82
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
It's just what you think.

84
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,600
The cat

85
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,030
is bought by my father.

86
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,550
 You sold out your partner.

87
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,710
 Why don't you say you are Kevin's father?

88
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,180

89
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,740
 Zhou Tian, I will be part of the crew soon.

90
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,730
 I heard that the condition in the crew is tough.

91
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,350
 We have to be fully prepared.

92
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,260

93
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,020
President Ji, I want to confirm something with you.

94
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,940
Qiao Yi will be part the crew in a few days.

95
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,930
He complained to me that

96
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,350
the accommodation of the crew is tough.

97
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,040
So I'm thinking...

98
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,850
 I knew you are 1003!

99
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,890
 You liar!

100
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,630
 Zhou Tian, let me explain.

101
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,990
 No way!

102
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,070
What's on your mind? What do you want to say?

103
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,430
Qiao Yi will enter the crew in a few days.

104
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,400
He complained to me that

105
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,790
the accommodation of the crew is tough.

106
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,480
So I'm thinking...

107
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,250
President Ji, your phone is ringing.

108
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,390
Let me take it for you.

109
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,970
No need.

110
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,960
President Ji, you know,

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,790
you are the CEO, always tied up.

112
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,540
What if you miss an important business call,

113
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,760
we'll suffer a great loss.

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,870
Let me check who's calling you.

115
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,490
Don't you know my watch and my phone are synchronized?

116
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,580

117
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,630
Hi, Director Peng.

118
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay.

119
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,790
We can talk about it someday.

120
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,040
All right.

121
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,600
What was going on with Qiao Yi?

122
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,810
Qiao Yi said the accommodation the crew offered is tough,

123
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,030
so I'm wondering to add some home appliances in his room.

124
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,560
 So weird.

125
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,160
 I called him, but why didn't his phone ring?

126
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,950
 Did I really get him wrong?

127
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,410
Hello?

128
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,960
Please place it in the security room at the gate of the community.

129
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,410
Thank you.

130
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,260
Security.

131
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700

132
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,140
Hi, Kevin, the urgent thing I told you about was to reschedule for 7 p.m. this evening.

133
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,660
Do the preparation according to the e-mail I sent you just now.

134
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,540
If you mess it up, you...
 -  I got it, Mr. Ji.

135
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,120
 If I mess it up, I'll disappear from your sight.

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,520
Where has she gone again?

137
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
 Did a thief sneak into Zhou Tian's house?

138
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,770
-  Can you be nice?  
 -  I didn't mean that.

139
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,400
 Then why was she in such a hurry home?

140
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,340
 And she said she would see the security guard.

141
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,840
 None of your business.

142
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,140
 Gosh. The security guard of the community has seen me.

143
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
Dear Gigi, have a cup of coffee.

144
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,290
All the work of the café today will count on me.

145
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,260
Now it's too late.

146
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,140
It's just fine if you fool around, but why did you have to take Brother Hao with you?

147
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,610
I promise it'll never happen again.

148
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,240
You are in charge of Brother Hao's everything, all right?

149
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,290
I promise I won't touch any of his hair.

150
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,850
Fine. Leave me alone.

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,910
Sir, do you remember me?

152
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes.

153
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,230
You live in the community, right?

154
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,930
I remember every resident in this community.

155
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,690
Do you remember my cat was lost two times,

156
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,480
and you sent her back to me.

157
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,290
Don't mention it. Not a big deal.

158
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,500
Sir, please look at this.

159
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,550
Can you recognize the man who sent my cat here and asked you to give it to me?

160
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480

161
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,890

162
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,420
It's...

163
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,790
Zhou Tian, let me explain!

164
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,310
It's him.

165
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,240
You are not allowed to park here.

166
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,140
Hey, I'm talking to you. The tall old man.

167
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,240
Sir, he's in his twenties.

168
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,260
Indeed a young man.

169
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,560
Anyway, you cannot park the car at the gate.

170
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,720
You... You know him, right?

171
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,470
Drive it away when you are done.

172
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,810
Here you are, your phone.

173
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,430
Drive the car away.

174
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,130
 It seems that the guard not only has a bad sight, but is muddled.

175
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,240
President Ji, didn't you say you want to explain something to me?

176
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,000
Please. What is it?

177
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,350
I just want to say...

178
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,410
I'm a bit strict with your work performance recently.

179
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,130
It's too much for you.

180
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,170
So I decide to lighten your workload.

181
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,100
You can make progress step by step.

182
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,050
So you especially came here to tell me this?

183
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,940
Not really.

184
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,850
I planned to fetch a document at home.

185
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,000
I passed by here and saw you.

186
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,610
I think you are a diligent employee, and you deserve further development.

187
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,180
So I came to communicate with you.

188
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,310
 You are used to lying to me, so you treat me a fool, right?

189
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,010
Why are you still talking here?

190
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,580
If my manager sees it, my wage will get deducted. Hurry up.

191
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,520
All right, I'll move right now.

192
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,400
Then I'm going back.

193
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,620
I have an appointment with a vital client at 7 p.m.. You come with me.

194
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,940
Dress yourself up in fancy clothes.

195
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,200
Wait for me in the office.

196
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,640
 You still want to change the topic with work.

197
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,700
 You are too naive.

198
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,470
 Even if the guard couldn't expose you, I have other ways.

199
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,250
 Go home?

200
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,640
 Fine.

201
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,020
 The crocodile can't get away this time.

202
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,270
 Hi, Master. I'm Universe.

203
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,150
 Your heart rate now is 76. Your blood pressure is 76.

204
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,940
Shut up.

205
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,580
 You are too anxious.

206
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,150
-  You should calm down, or...  
 - Shut up.

207
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,830
That was too close.

208
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,170
Zhou Tian almost found it out.

209
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,620

210
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,500

211
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,660

212
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,610
He doesn't forget to urge me to work even at this moment.

213
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,870
Just wait and see.

214
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,020
Go.

215
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,840
Enjoy you banquet at the hypocritical 1003's.

216
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,740

217
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,580
Hi, Kevin, have you gotten everything on the spot ready?

218
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,410
As soon as we arrive, crack open the champagne.

219
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,440
 Zhou Tian, maybe in your eyes,

220
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,940
 I'm the one who pushes you forward,

221
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,750
 and gives you a lot of work.

222
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,980
 But actually,

223
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,630
 I'm 1003, the keeper No. 2 of Qiu Qiu.

224
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,600
 The reason why I didn't tell you

225
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,340
 was that I didn't want you to rely on me.

226
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,700
 It would be no good for your growth at work.

227
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,230
 You didn't know how much I did for you.

228
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,230
 All I have done is to make you understand

229
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,870
 I like you.

230
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,200
 I didn't know President Ji had always been meticulously taking care of me.

231
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
 No, don't call me President Ji.

232
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,550
 Call me Chen Chen.

233
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,900
 Chen Chen.

234
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,920
 Xiao Tian.

235
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,720
You guys have been arguing everything for like thirty years.

236
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,310
You started arguing again.

237
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,560
Save it.

238
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,470
Let's get back to business.

239
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,120
Right. We are discussing Zhou Tian and Zhang Hao.

240
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,300
Let's stop fighting.

241
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,780
All right. They have known each other for so long.

242
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,930
They should lose no time and get married.

243
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,510
Yes. I have prepared the deposit for the hotel.

244
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,590
No matter who Zhou Tian is dating in the future,

245
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,160
we are ready for her wedding at any time.

246
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,770
No matter who?

247
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,870
He must be Zhang Hao!

248
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,520
Come on. Let's discuss how to get them back and get married.

249
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Come on!

250
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,500
The situation now...

251
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,190
That's right.

252
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,330
What brought you here?

253
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,870
For work, of course.

254
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,320
Do you think I have any evil designs for you?

255
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,830
Since it's about work, we can talk about it in the company.

256
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,500
I have to deal with the thing at your home.

257
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,060

258
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,220

259
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,240
 Zhou Tian, I want that electric appliance which can speak as Ji Chen has.

260
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,940
President Ji, you also know that I have to meet Qiao Yi's demand.

261
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,690
This is not a hard thing.

262
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,790
I just have to visit your house,

263
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,040
so I can buy the stuff online.

264
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,940
President Ji, you can do your business.

265
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,280
Leave me alone. I'll show myself around.

266
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,620
The Intelligent audio is pretty good.

267
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,000
What brand is it?

268
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,630
 Hello, if you would like to use, please use your voice to login.

269
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,500
Login?

270
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,990
 The host's account is already in use.

271
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,770
 Do you wish to register as a hostess?

272
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,340
Don't say yes!

273
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,870
 All right. Registered. Welcome, hostess.

274
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,850
This thing is more than intelligent.

275
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,520
It's super intelligent!

276
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,670
It's customized for me.

277
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,700
Therefore, it doesn't have a brand.

278
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,750
This sound is too much.

279
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,210
I should go to Qiao Yi's, and get his sound.

280
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,060
 Where is Qiu Qiu?

281
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,800
I think that robots might be useful.

282
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,790
Qiao Yi will like it.

283
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,950
Please don't...

284
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,180
 Oh, shoot.

285
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,030
 She should be here by now.

286
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,780
 Qiu Qiu just stoped.

287
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,780
Oh, no.

288
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,070
Hi, Dad.

289
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,040
 I'm at my boss's place.

290
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm busy right now.

291
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,120
Oh, it hurts.

292
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,460
 I can't talk right now. Bye.

293
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
She hung up already.

294
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,040
It's all right. Her boss might be a female.

295
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,680
- What do you mean? 
 -  I'd rather her boss be a man.

296
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,370
Oh my, it hurts so bad.

297
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,420
Zhou Tian. I'll have all the information about those electronic appliances checked and sent to you later.

298
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,080
It's fine. I have checked their models already.

299
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,630
No need to send them.

300
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,430
Then, Qiao Yi is short-tempered.

301
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,700
He won't wait for me.

302
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,640
We need to see our client at 7:00 p.m. You should go back to the company now.

303
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,390
No. I should stay and check if there is anything else.

304
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,980
Did you find what you need?

305
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,530
If no, you should go.

306
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,490
There is nothing here that Qiao Yi may like.

307
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,100
- I should go upstairs and check again. 
 - Sure.

308
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,860
 He wants me to leave so bad.

309
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,500
 He must be really worried.

310
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,320
 I think Qiu Qiu is hidden somewhere.

311
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,160
What's the matter, President Ji?

312
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,360
It's getting dark. Those curtains should be drawn.

313
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,120
You drew the curtains so fast that I thought you were planning something evil.

314
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,360
 Perhaps Qiu Qiu is behind the couch.

315
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,180
This intelligent lamp seems amazing.

316
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,360
What are you doing?

317
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:03,300
President Ji, you didn't seem quite right from the beginning.

318
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,230
You acted like you were hiding something.

319
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,810
 So awkward.

320
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,660
 Is he going to kiss me?

321
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,300
 What's this?

322
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,570
 It's my number code.

323
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,060
 What do these numbers stand for?

324
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,070
 Every two numbers represent one letter according to the order of the alphabet.

325
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,330
 Zero eight represents "H". Zero one represents "A".

326
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,680
Do you have anything you want to say?

327
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,750
Yes.

328
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,470
But we don't have time now.

329
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,840
I'll tell you on our way to dinner.

330
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,260
President Ji. Let me tell you a story.

331
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,760
A close friend of mine recently met someone online.

332
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,670
That guy also likes to hide secrets with numbers.

333
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,750
They had a great time talking with each other.

334
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,870
My friend even shared her personal feelings with that guy.

335
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,850
However, she found out that guy was her boss.

336
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,300
It was all premeditated.

337
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,680
Tell me. What should she do?

338
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,030
I say...

339
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,500
We are really out of time now.

340
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,580
Do you really have nothing to share with me?

341
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,500
I can't tell you now.

342
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,230
Now, let's go.

343
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,750
President Ji. I'm not feeling well.

344
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,070
So, I'm not going to meet our client with you tonight.

345
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,800
Kevin will company you.

346
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,540
Bye.

347
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,840
Zhou Tian.

348
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,630
Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian!

349
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,700
Wait a minute, Zhou Tian.

350
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,320
Zhou Tian.

351
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,740
Please come with me.

352
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,770
You will know everything.

353
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,370
I already knew. You are that guy 1003.

354
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,450
According to the alphabet, No. 10 stands for the letter J.

355
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,060
No. 10 stands for letter J. And No. 03 stands for the letter C.

356
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,670
Therefore, 1003 actually represents JC, which is the abbreviation for Ji Chen.

357
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,260
It was so obvious. I can't believe I didn't realize it earlier.

358
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,570
And I let you deceive me for so long.

359
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,280
What a wily CEO you are!

360
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,430
So smart! Well done!

361
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,250
You took advantage of my trust, and got information from me.

362
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,430
I have said so many things to you.

363
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,890
You must have planned how to get back to me while listening to my complaints.

364
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,870
I can't believe I walked right into your trap.

365
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,900
Zhou Tian, I really need you to go somewhere with me.

366
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
You will see.

367
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,030
I'm sorry, President Ji. I'm going home.

368
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,600
I...

369
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,520
And Qiu Qiu, you lied to her as well.

370
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,640
Please leave her alone from now on.

371
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,230
Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian.

372
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,820

373
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,910
Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian. Please don't be mad.

374
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,410
Please get in the car. Let's talk. Zhou...

375
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,710
Zhou Tian.

376
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,730
President Ji. If my memory serves me right, I'm off work right now.

377
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,200
It's beyond work hours. You don't get to boss me around now.

378
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,950
Please don't be mad, Zhou Tian. We can talk in the car.

379
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,110
Ji Chen. Do you think it's some kind of joke?

380
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,460
As a retired athlete, I had to start over in Xing Yi.

381
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,130
I need to build a new career, adapt to my new job, and deal with interpersonal relationships.

382
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,770
It was a difficult time for me.

383
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,480
Suddenly, there was a guy who was willing to help with my cat.

384
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,420
He understood me, cared about me, and complained about my boss with me.

385
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,560
It turned out that guy was my boss.

386
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,430
You sweet-talked me on WeChat, while giving me a hard time in the company.

387
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,520
Is it fun to see me being fooled around like that?

388
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,020
Zhou Tian. I know I shouldn't have deceived you, and I didn't mean that.

389
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,850
I met Qiu Qiu by accident.

390
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,770
And I did find you repulsive in the beginning.

391
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,350
Look at you, you don't have an advanced degree, and you don't really know how to dress up.

392
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,800
Plus, when you play, you don't seem like a girl.

393
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,680
When I give you a task,

394
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
you always mess it up.

395
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,860
And you always did the opposite even if you promised to do as I asked.

396
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,820
- However, I don't know why, but I... 
 - Enough!

397
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,920
Since I'm such a terrible employee, you can fire me.

398
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,870
You can ask the human resources to terminate my employment tomorrow.

399
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,070
Zhou Tian. But I...

400
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,820
I'm not done talking yet.

401
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,670
President Ji.

402
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,720
Where is Zhou Tian?

403
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,730
I see, President Ji.

404
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,570
You must have come around and decided not to call her.

405
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,820
That's great! I know that you will come to your sense.

406
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,030
I'm telling you, I thought you were beyond yourself before.

407
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,330
I almost wanted to find a shrink for you.

408
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,930
And that day when Miss Jiang called you...

409
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,870
So, President Ji is the actual 1003,

410
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,600
who raised the cat with you and complained about our boss?

411
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,780
Well... Did you tell him a lot about our work?

412
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,260
Did you tell him that we cursed him behind his back?

413
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,330
Oh, no. Tian Tian, you are killing me here.

414
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,660
Stop that.

415
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,730
I didn't mention you.

416
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,210
All I did was complain about my work.

417
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,620
He's such a pervert.

418
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,880
I can't believe he enjoyed fooling me.

419
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,640
I yelled at him hard today.

420
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,070
But Tian Tian, you yelled at him, and you asked him to fire you.

421
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,320
What if he does ask human resources to fire you?

422
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,860
That's fine. I'll just go.

423
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,670
I don't want to see his face again.

424
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,400
What's going on here?

425
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,750
How much did he drink?

426
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,080
It should be the fifth glass.

427
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,440
Can I have a cup of Irish coffee?

428
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,920
No...

429
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,310
Coffee, please.

430
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,420
- Give him this. 
 - This can work?

431
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,130
He's drunk now. He won't tell.

432
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,600
Thanks.

433
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,550
He really couldn't tell tea from wine.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,950

435
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Brother, is there something bothering you?

436
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,320
Perhaps you can tell me and let me be amused.

437
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,950
Don't you always want to be a sports talent manager?

438
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,750
I was furious today.

439
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,560
That's why I asked him to fire me.

440
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,590
But come to think about it,

441
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,220
it's his fault.

442
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,350
Why do I have to leave?

443
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't care.

444
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,520
I'll go to work tomorrow as usual.

445
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,910
And I'll continue to work there as long as he allows.

446
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,420
You don't think he will skimp my wages, do you?

447
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,320
I'll just ignore him in the company.

448
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,650
He is your boss, and he's so handsome.

449
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,800
He did lie to you. So what?

450
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,200
Don't you forget how gentle, caring,

451
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,740
and considerate when he was just 1003.

452
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,530
Wouldn't it be nice when President Ji actually acts like that in real life?

453
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,680
Xia Chunqiu,

454
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,560
who do you support here?

455
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,610
I am your friend, not Ji Chen.

456
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,110
Let's be clear.

457
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,390
I'm your friend,

458
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,060
and I was deceived and humiliated by Ji Chen.

459
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,910
Yes, you are my friend, but...

460
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,690
Ji Chen is my idol.

461
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,330
I wish he could deceive me.

462
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,060
You know what? A character with inappropriate life values

463
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,820
like you will be banned to talk in a TV series.

464
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,380
If you dare to fall for a crazy boss like him, I will...

465
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,950
You are health-conscious all the time,

466
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,920
and especially so after our dad passed away.

467
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,520
You were so careful

468
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,620
that you didn't drink once.

469
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,450
But now, look how drunk you are.

470
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,630
Did Tian Tian refuse your love?

471
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,350
I didn't finish talking.

472
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,150
She just... got mad and left.

473
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,340
So, what did President Ji say?

474
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,630
"I met Qiu Qiu by accident."

475
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,760
"I did find you repulsive in the beginning."

476
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,310
"Look at you, you don't have an advanced degree."

477
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,460
"You don't really know how to dress up."

478
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,920
"You don't look like a girl when you play."

479
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,320
"You were very imprudent at the beginning."

480
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,120
"And you always caused trouble for me."

481
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,610
"You always did the opposite,"

482
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,030
"even if you promised to do as I asked."

483
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,740
What happened then?

484
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,120
- Then, I... I yelled at him. 
 - No, that's not right.

485
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,490
Judging from his tone, he was going to say but next.

486
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,280
But...

487
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,300
He did seem to say but.

488
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,330
- But what? 
 - I was outraged, and I left after I yelled at him.

489
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,660
I didn't stay to let him finish.

490
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,540
What are you laughing about?

491
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,560
It's nothing. I can imagine how ugly it was.

492
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,230
Brother. It seems you are not good at this.

493
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,040
That's the problem.

494
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,050
I mean, look at you.

495
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,860
You are complaining about him to me,

496
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,340
and you are doing it while having coke and junk food.

497
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,290
You look exactly like a girl who just broke up with her boyfriend.

498
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm not good at this?

499
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,980
I graduated from a top business institution as the valedictorian.

500
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,610
I was a straight-A student,

501
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,560
and the chief editor of our school journal.

502
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,610
I can speak fluent English and French.

503
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:53,230
I became the youngest vice president of An Sheng Group

504
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,980
after working there for only five years.

505
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,340
I'm the best among the elites.

506
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,780
You are highly educated, so what?

507
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,270
It doesn't mean that you can insult people.

508
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,850
He does have an advanced degree and he is rich. But he's mean.

509
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,170
I dare him to compete with me in the running.

510
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,680
He is good at business, but I'm good at sports.

511
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,150
Can you win bread by running?

512
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,210
Plus, I did see your potential.

513
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,760
That's why I hired you, and let you be involved in all those projects.

514
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,430
I just wanted you to grow fast.

515
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,410
So I happen to be 1003.

516
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,780
It's not my fault.

517
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,030
It was by accident that I found out

518
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,520
Zhou Tian and Sunday are the same person.

519
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,790
By accident?

520
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,630
Why don't you tell me when you found out?

521
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,630
Instead of telling me, you hid the fact and watched me making a fool of myself.

522
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,220
And when I revealed your trick,

523
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,280
you insulted me some more by listing all my shortcomings.

524
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,910
You degraded and humiliated me so that you could keep your own self-esteem.

525
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,280
That's just disgusting.

526
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,230
How could you be so ruthless!

527
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:58,691
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

528
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:02,651
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

529
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:07,251

533
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:26,086
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

534
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:30,391
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

535
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:36,021
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

536
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:39,621
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

537
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:44,291
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

538

♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

546
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:32,021
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

547
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:42,021
♫  Shine for you  ♫

548
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:50,721
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

549
