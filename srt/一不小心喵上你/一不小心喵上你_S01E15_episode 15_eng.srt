1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,430
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,430
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,230
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,740

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,920

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,830
I am 1003.

19
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,360
How did this fact become my fault?

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,530
I found out by coincidence

21
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,000
that Zhou Tian and Sunday is the same person.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,260
Coincidence?

23
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,970
Why didn't you tell me when you found out?

24
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,050
You didn't tell me and watched me make a fool of myself.

25
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,110
After I knew your identity, you followed me out to give me an earful.

26
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,740
You listed my flaws.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,410
You trampled and stomped on my dignity to satisfy your pretension.

28
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,780
You're a pure devil.

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,740
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,130
What's wrong with having flaws?

31
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,740
Even though you have those flaws,

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,100
I still like you.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,190
Nothing was wrong with my confession!

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
It's called strategy. Understand?

35
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,060
Haven't you ever seen a strategy before?

36
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,250
How dare you say that! Everyone has flaws.

37
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,580
You didn't have to talk to me like that!

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,900
You're so arrogant and rude.

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,140
Has anyone ever taught you how to be polite and respect others?

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,390
Calm down. Don't be angry.

41
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,900
So rude!

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,970
I'm telling you, if I ever chat with you again on WeChat,

43
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,160
I'll call myself the biggest fool alive!

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,310
Did you actually say that?

45
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,320
If I were her, I would have slapped you.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,710
Tian Tian's temperament is pretty good.

47
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,790
She didn't even beat you up.

48
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,810
But it was true!

49
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,810
Brother, have you ever seen a man confess to a woman after listing all her flaws?

50
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,180
Then, as if he was unwilling, he said,

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,390
"Even though you're full of flaws, I still like you very much."

52
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,620
"You can kneel and thank me now."

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,380
Whatever you said to Tian Tian meant exactly the same.

54
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,680
Think about it!

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,180
I think, you should properly and sincerely

56
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,300
apologize to Tian.

57
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,460
I apologize to her?

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,150
Don't be kidding.

59
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,200
Sunday, I...

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,300

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,860

62
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,940
 - Are you free?   
 - Yes.

63
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,910
Are you home?

64
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,170
Of course. It's still early.

65
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,130
 - Then, last night... 
 -  Tian Tian, your father and I will pay you a visit in a few days.

66
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,360
When?

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,880
 - Soon.  
  - In a few days.

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,660
Why so hurry?

69
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,920
What do you want?

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,930
 Well... I suppose that this year,

71
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,910
 you and Xiao Hao will have some difficulties with your relationship.

72
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,340
 Me, your mom, your Uncle Zhang, and his wife,

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,930
 we will go to see you together.

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,910
I knew it!

75
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,570
Can you stop?

76
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,400
Senior Zhang Hao and I are not a couple.

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,440
We're just friends.

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,940
If you keep doing this, you'll make us awkward.

79
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,400
 Awkward?

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,350
-  You two are a perfect match!  
 -  Sure!

81
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,310
 Tian'er, we're not asking for your opinion.

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,600
 We've made a decision.

83
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,590
 Our two families will have dinner together.

84
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,550
 Uncle Zhang made a reservation at a restaurant.

85
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,960
 I'll text you the address later.

86
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,170
Wait...

87
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,920
What...

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,940
What the hell!

89
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,230
What is going on?

90
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,980
My boss messed with me, and my parents forced me to get married.

91
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,120
This is too much for me. I'm so tired of this!

92
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,460
Xin Xin,

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,720
- I'll have a sandwich. 
 - Okay.

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,790
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks.

95
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,270
Tian Tian.

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,270
Someone left a gift for you.

97
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,800
For me?

98
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,140
Who?

99
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,690
No idea.

100
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,970
 Ji Chen, do you think this will make me forgive you?

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,080
 That's not going to happen!

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,990
Why is there a tree branch on this crocodile plush?

103
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,420
This branch means begging for forgiveness.

104
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,410
Begging for forgiveness? How?

105
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,890
This is how!

106
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,730
I'll go to work.

107
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,020

108
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,460
That shouldn't be what it means...

109
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,540

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,810
 Dear Miss Sunday, I'm sorry for lying to you.

111
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,430
But I had no choice.

112
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,560
 I hope you can give me a chance to explain this to you in person.

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,460
 Mr. Crocodile.

114
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,240
A letter of apology to smooth things over?

115
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,080
I didn't expect him to be so stupid.

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,260

117
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,500

118
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,940

119
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,980
You're no match for me!

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,340

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,310
Dad, Mom, I'm at work.

122
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,250
 I didn't want to call.

123
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,100
 Your mom did. Look!

124
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,400
 Tian'er.

125
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,050
 Tian'er, do you like my dress?

126
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,620
 There are more.

127
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,050
 Look, this one! How is it?

128
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,880
 This one, and this one.

129
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,560
Mom, do you have to wear a red dress to see me?

130
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,510
 Of course! You're going to get engaged!

131
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,320
 Tian'er, your dad and I will go to see you

132
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,350
 because we want you and Xiao Hao to get engaged.

133
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,490
 You must do this as soon as possible.

134
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,360
I've said countless times.

135
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,500
Senior Hao and I are just friends.

136
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,030
 Well, if you are really not interested in Xiao Hao,

137
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,980
 I won't force you.

138
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,830
 Anyway, I'm not very satisfied with your Uncle Zhang.

139
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,840
 I'll talk with your mom.

140
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,410
 Who should we choose?

141
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,050
Dad! Don't worry about it.

142
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,450
 W-What do you mean? Worry?

143
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,120
 This weekend, you have to get engaged.

144
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,280
 Hey, let's talk about it. Who should we choose for her?

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,140
No need. I... I can choose one myself.

146
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh, dear...

147
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,900
Did she hang up?

148
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,540
It's your fault! What were you talking about?

149
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,900
Choose? Who else can we choose?

150
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,900
I was just joking.

151
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,780
 If I want my parents and Uncle Zhang to give up this idea once and for all,

152
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,620
 I have to take some practical actions.

153
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,140
 If Brother Zhang Hao and I remain single,

154
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,030
 they will never give up their hope.

155
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,270
 So, I have to find a boyfriend.

156
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,480
 No. A fake boyfriend.

157
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,690
 And... Who should I choose?

158
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,090
 It seems like I don't have a lot of options.

159
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,470
 That liar!

160
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,210
 Get out of my head!

161
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,740
President Ji.

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,260
- Yes? 
  - Wow, President Ji. I'm impressed.

163
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,170
I only heard that someone could recite a book backward.

164
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,400
But I've never seen anyone reading a book upside down.

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,750
I'm very impressed.

166
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,870
It seems your reading skill is improving.

167
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm talented.

168
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
What do you want?

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,460

170
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,650
Oh, I almost forgot.

171
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,540
And Xin Xin.

172
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,960
 Dad, Mom.

173
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,070
 This is my boyfriend, Kevin.

174
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,550
 - Nice to meet you. 
 - Hello.

175
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,780
 Hey, Waitress!

176
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,450
 What's wrong with this fish?

177
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,330
 It's too greasy! There's too much soy sauce in it!

178
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,810
 And that pigeon, was it an adult pigeon before you make it into a dish?

179
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,440
 And those vegetables, are those organic and pollution-free?

180
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,210
 Did your chef graduate from a famous culinary school?

181
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,380
No way.

182
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,850
Kevin is a monster.

183
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,040
 Dad, Mom. This is my boyfriend, Chen Can.

184
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,960
 Nice to meet you, Uncle, Auntie.

185
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,770
 Sit.

186
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,160
 Well, you...

187
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,740
 He must be hungry.

188
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,350
 - Come on! Please eat. 
 - Okay. Let's eat.

189
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,720
 Try this. And this one.

190
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,440
 It's tasty.

191
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,820
 Waitress, the bill, please.

192
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,240
 Hi, Sir. That will be 368 yuan in total.

193
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,770
 Show me the ticket, please.

194
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,930
 Well, you see, this meal costs 368 yuan.

195
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,420
 This fish costs 88 yuan.

196
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,680
 I didn't eat any of it, so I need to subtract its price.

197
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,840
 That will be 280 yuan in total.

198
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,470
 This bowl of noodles costs 60 yuan.

199
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,190
 But I only had a tiny bit of it, and the three of you ate the rest.

200
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,540
 I ate less than a quarter of that dish.

201
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,850
 I guess, I'll pay 10 yuan for it at most.

202
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,380
 So, that will be 280 minus 60,

203
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,170
 divided by four, then plus ten.

204
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,600
 And... 65 yuan in total.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,070
 Do you want me to pay by WeChat or cash?

206
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,460
This man is the biggest miser I've ever seen!

207
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,350
No way.

208
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,930
 Dad, Mom. This is Xin Xin.

209
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,200
 Nice to meet you.

210
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,810
 What do you often do?

211
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,130
 Me? I often hit the bar, go to the nightclubs, and mess around!

212
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,250
 Life is all about partying and playing!

213
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,300
 Xin Xin has a bubbly personality.

214
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,190
 Are you sure you want a playboy?

215
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,820
If...I let him have a rehearsal in advance

216
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,560
and prepare some lines,

217
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,380
it should be fine.

218
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,130
Okay!

219
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll pick you!

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,480
A watch brand wants to invite Qiao Yi to attend their event

221
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,460
and become one of their first guests to experience their product.

222
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,780
They'll display Qiao Yi's photo at every store nationwide.

223
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,390
However, Brother Yi has been very busy recently.

224
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,460
He doesn't have enough time to take a new photo.

225
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,140
President Ji, what's wrong?

226
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm thirsty.

227
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,850
- I'll get you some water. 
 - No need.

228
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,620
I'll get it myself.

229
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,120
He doesn't need me anymore?

230
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,890
What? Your parents forced you to get engaged?

231
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,280
Lower your voice.

232
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,990
Calm down. It's not like that.

233
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,740
More or less.

234
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,640
Don't your parents always want you and Zhang Hao to be together?

235
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,740
Will they come over this weekend?

236
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,080
Are you prepared?

237
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,600
Of course!

238
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,070
I'll ask someone to be my fake boyfriend.

239
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,990
They won't believe me no matter what I say.

240
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,460
They always believe there is something between Zhang Hao and me.

241
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,590
So, I decided to fool them.

242
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,810
Are your parents easy to fool?

243
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,280
Of course not.

244
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,540
That's why I need a plan.

245
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,700
I've made a decision.

246
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,230
I want to take three days off

247
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,580
to go travel with my fake boyfriend.

248
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,480
I'll take many photos in case my parents ask me for proof.

249
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,250
This is a good plan!

250
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,200
By the way, you can ask President Ji for help.

251
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,420
The understanding between a couple cannot be formed within a short period.

252
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,390
It's a long-term thing.

253
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,630
You and President Ji have the advantage.

254
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,190
You've been working for a long, so you know each other well.

255
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,800
You can also let him make it up to you by giving him this opportunity.

256
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,230
- You're so clever, aren't you? 
 - Am I?

257
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,140
Xia Chunqiu.

258
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,260
Did he bribe you or bewitch you?

259
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,420
You must have lost your mind.

260
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,790
I...

261
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,170
Cancel all my schedules of this week.

262
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,490
President Ji. I want to take three days off.

263
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,580
Our hands are full. You can't take a day off
whenever you want.

264
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,400
You have to apply for it a week in advance, and fill out an application in the OA system of the company.

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,680
You'll also need the permission of your leader. Don't you know?

266
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,720
I agree.

267
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,650
Thank you, President Ji.

268
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,180
I finished the publicity proposal of Qiao Yi's new book

269
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,050
and sent it to your email.

270
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,890
I'll be waiting for your comment.

271
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,430
President Ji, are you feeling unwell?

272
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,110
I'll make a reservation with a respiratory physician.

273
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,090
 Hey, Xin Xin. Are you at the cat cafe?

274
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,090
 I need to borrow you for a few days.

275
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,490
I'll see you soon, and explain everything to you.

276
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,940
Okay!

277
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,620

278
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,310

279
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,220
What are you looking at? Hello?

280
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,790
I'm looking at my girlfriend.

281
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,720
You're good.

282
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,130
I didn't even ask you, and you already knew what I'm thinking.

283
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,730
You're good at this.

284
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,010
You should give me your blessing!

285
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,660
Okay, I'm giving you my blessing.

286
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,320
What do you need?

287
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,410
My parents are urging me to get married.

288
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,620
So I want to ask you to be my fake boyfriend. Please help me out.

289
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,430
Well... Sorry.

290
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,770
It's too late.

291
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,210
Speak normally!

292
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, I did have a crush on you at a particular moment.

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,960
But the past is the past.

294
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm not asking you to be my actual boyfriend.

295
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm just asking you for help.

296
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,160
No, I can't.

297
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,800
My heart belongs to someone else.

298
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,050
I don't want to disappoint her.

299
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,450
You can...

300
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,050
You can ask Brother Hao!

301
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,910
He can be your boyfriend.

302
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,920
No, he can't.

303
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,940
Brother Zhang Hao is my boyfriend now.

304
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,130
- What? 
 - What?

305
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,860
Ten-day couple?

306
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,710
If he still can't fall in love with me after ten days,

307
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,270
I'll fail.

308
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,930
So, this weekend,

309
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,640
Zhang Hao will take you to meet his parents.

310
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,230
His parents?

311
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,010
Not only his parents, mines as well.

312
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,960
They set a trap for us, waiting for us to jump inside.

313
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,550
They set a trap for you two?

314
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,130
Why? You're not their prey.

315
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,690
They want me to marry Brother Hao.

316
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,960
Tian Tian, are you really going to marry Brother Zhang Hao?

317
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,290
Of course not!

318
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,720
However, this time, the four of them will come together.

319
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,610
I have to be well-prepared.

320
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,590
I didn't expect my dad to collaborate with Uncle Zhang.

321
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,350
What do you mean?

322
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,410
Are they enemies?

323
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,410
For all these years, my dad and Uncle Zhang

324
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,210
have been competing with each other in secret.

325
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,910
Uncle Zhang was a section chief, but my dad was a deputy section chief.

326
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,360
As a result,

327
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,980
my dad wasn't satisfied of being a deputy,

328
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,730
so he accepted the buy-out offer and returned home to build a farm.

329
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,520
Whenever they met, they would jeer at each other.

330
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,960
Even so, they still insist on you being their daughter-in-law.

331
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,860
It seems they really like you a lot.

332
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,410
Tian Tian, you won't surrender, will you?

333
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,820
Relax. Brother Hao is yours.

334
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,350
Xin Xin, I need an answer right now.

335
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,900
Will you help me or not?

336
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,460
There are so many girls around.

337
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,960
I can always have another option.

338
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,000
Tian'er, I'll give you another chance.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,470
Don't let me down.

340
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,320
Otherwise, we'll be broken.

341
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,220
I'll take that as a rejection.

342
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,820
Tian'er! Don't go!

343
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,260
Why don't you ask me again? Maybe I'll say yes this time!

344
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,860
Aren't we going to the airport?

345
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,360
Why should we go there?

346
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,320
Aren't you gonna take me to travel around the world?

347
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,540
Is something wrong with your mind?

348
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,660
Then why did you ask me to bring my clothes for every season?

349
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,390
To take photos.

350
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,120
If I want to fake my relationship, I'm going to need some real photos.

351
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm telling you, my parents are hard to fool.

352
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,760
So, today, we'll go sightseeing as a couple

353
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,870
and take photos together.

354
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,820
May I protest?

355
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,030
No, you may not.

356
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,510
Come on! Here!

357
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,200
One, two, three.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,910
Smile.
Okay.

359
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,850
Look at the camera.

360
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,650
One, two, three.

361
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,780
Perfect!

362
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,620
All done.

363
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,430
Hi, your photos are ready.

364
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,130
Thanks.

365
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,760
No problem.

366
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,340
Tian Tian, I'm exhausted. I don't want to take photos anymore.

367
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,840
All right. These are enough. Let's go.

368
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,720
I can't. I can't walk anymore.

369
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,360
- I can carry you. 
 - No need.

370
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,710
Can you say yes to my request?

371
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,920
What is it?

372
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,830
When we came in, I saw an amusement park.

373
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,640
Can we go there together? I love the carousel.

374
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,520
Yes, no problem.

375
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,560
This old perv. He dared to follow me!

376
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,590
Come on, stop looking!

377
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,560
Come on! Let's go to the amusement park!

378
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,060
Xiao Zhou, look at the camera!

379
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,420
Hurry up!

380
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Give me a "V"!

381
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,010
Let's take a photo of us kissing!

382
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,940
Give me a pose. Please!

383
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,660
Come on.

384
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,790
President Ji, didn't we come out for work?

385
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,240
Why are we here?

386
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,490
That should be enough. Are you done?

387
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,620
I've been helping you all day. This place is my favorite.

388
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,320
You said you wanted to improve our relationship and deepen our understanding.

389
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,120
If you're so unwilling, I can't guarantee my cooperation.

390
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,430
All right, fine.

391
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,410
- Keep shooting. 
 - Come on.

392
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,170
Here!

393
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,660
What a boring ride. Why is it popular?

394
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,110
President Ji, you don't understand.

395
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,130
Adults love carousel

396
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,520
because it has a special meaning.

397
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,680
Girls enjoy the carousel with their lovers

398
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,720
because during the ride of circling around,

399
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,140
the view may be different,

400
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,790
the people around may come and go, but the person next to you is always the same.

401
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,320
However, the carousel is the cruelest game in the world.

402
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Chasing each other, but there's always a distance
between them.

403
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,690
Pretty!

404
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,820
 Ji Chen?

405
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,770
 This perv! Did he follow me here?

406
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,860
Zhou Tian.

407
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,560
Xiao Tian, look here! This angle is perfect! Here.

408
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,550
One more.

409
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,160
Hurry!

410
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,960
Let's go.

411
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,640
President Ji? What happened?

412
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,720
Didn't you come here to work?

413
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,170
But why are you acting so weird?

414
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,510
I'm still very confused.

415
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,900
Who are we hiding from?

416
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,660
President Ji, what's wrong?

417
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,170
Thanks.

418
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,460
- Bye.
 - Bye.

419
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,860
Don't eat it.

420
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,840
- Why? 
 - Let's take a photo first.

421
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,490
- Again? 
 - Only one. Come on! Hurry.

422
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,650
This way.

423
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,820
Here, look at the camera.

424
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,550
Three, two, one, cheese...

425
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Hey! S-Stop!

426
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,170
Here, wipe it.

427
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,850
Tian'er. Look at my clothes! How can I go to a restaurant wearing this?

428
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,270
It's okay, I will buy you another.

429
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,480
Don't be mad. Let's go.

430
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,960
This brat is so annoying.

431
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,250
Tian'er, this crocodile is indeed following us.

432
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,360
Say it. Why are you following us like a thief?

433
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,600
I knew something was wrong.

434
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,990
Let me see who you are!

435
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,700
 It's you.

436
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,540
Can you please stop pestering me?

437
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,380
I am just an ordinary girl.

438
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,680
Everything I do cannot affect anything in this world.

439
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,110
It never had, and it never will.

440
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,050
You have a whole world of choices.

441
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,660
You can choose someone who is prettier and smarter than me.

442
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm not suitable for you. I have countless flaws and very few virtues.

443
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,280
Nevermind.

444
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,300
How can someone understand the warmth of love if his heart is cold?

445
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,180
Especially a crocodile like you.

446
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,710
You raised your head arrogantly every single day,

447
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,610
waiting for your prey.

448
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,530
You wouldn't even shed a tear when you devoured it.

449
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,840
And you even waited for the prey to beg for your attack.

450
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,660
Didn't you?

451
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,510
You have determined to eat me alive, haven't you?

452
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,240
Do it! Do it!

453
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,810
What's wrong, Xin Xin?

454
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,520
I thought you were a sunflower, but you are actually a cactus.

455
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,960
What's wrong with being a cactus?

456
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,710
Cactus can prevent radiation.

457
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,340
See? There are too many thorns on you.

458
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,020
Thorns are good as well.

459
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,560
My thorns can protect me and harm the bad guys.

460
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,850
No wonder you can't find a boyfriend and even have to ask me for help.

461
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,050
Then will you help me or not?

462
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,130
I've already said yes.

463
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,120
Besides, you took me to the carousel.

464
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,840
We're in the same boat now.

465
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,260
Good.

466
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,350
Well, I'll see you then.

467
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,910
I'll text you the date and the address.

468
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,840
No problem.

469
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,570
President Ji! Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

470
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,650
I bought you water.

471
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,720
Mr. Ji, what's wrong?

472
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,080
Ji Chen.

473
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,010
You're an arrogant crocodile.

474
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,490
This... I...

475
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,700
 Are you on the way?

476
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,430
Dad, Mom. You don't need to worry about my relationship with Zhou Tian.

477
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,520
Hello? Mom? Are you there?

478
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,230
Hello?

479
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,670
"My loved one is my hero."

480
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,640
"I know that someday, he will marry me under countless gazes,"

481
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,240
"wearing his gold and shining armor while treading on the seven-colored cloud."

482
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,070
"I knew how our story would begin,"

483
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,490
"but I didn't know how it would end."

484
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,240
 The lines from "A Chinese Odyssey"

485
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,070
Put away your sword.

486
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,840
Where's Xin Xin?

487
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,620
Tian Tian took Xin Xin away to be her fake boyfriend,

488
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,090
because her parents are coming.

489
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,820
Brother Zhang Hao, I have heard your parents will come as well.

490
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,020
Can you take me to meet them?

491
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,100
I can be your girlfriend.

492
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,990
You? Do you want to dress like this and carry a sword?

493
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,190
Why? You want to fight my parents?

494
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,590
Of course not!

495
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,690
Your parents will be happy for you if you have found a fairy as your girlfriend.

496
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,540
Besides, I am very diversified.

497
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,610
As long as you tell me your parent's favorite type of daughter-in-law,

498
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,500
I can dress myself up according to their preferences.

499
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,550
Okay, stop.

500
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,010
No way.

501
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,390
- Brother Zhang Hao, how can you say no if you don't even try? 
 - No way.

502
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,590
You have to give more chances to our relationship.

503
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,370
No way. No! I can't!

504
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,750
Don't forget our deal! We have ten days!

505
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,660
No way! Absolutely no!

506
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,190
Brother Zhang Hao, please!

507
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,100
Please!

508
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,110
Brother Zhang Hao, please! I beg you.

509
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,210
Where on earth is Xin Xin?

510
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,100
He's going to be late!

511
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:11,700

512
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,910
Why are you standing here?

513
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,410
My baby!

514
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,710
Come on, give me a hug!

515
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,410
Wow! Dad, Mom. Your clothes are so fancy!

516
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,690
Fancy?

517
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,990
Really? These are new!

518
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,610
Your dad said we had to look fancier than Xiao Hao's family.

519
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,620
Understand?

520
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,900
Seriously?

521
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,820
If others saw you, they might think you would go on a blind date.

522
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,760
You silly girl. How can you say that?

523
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,150
But anyway, Dad, why do you want Zhang Hao and I

524
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,730
to be a couple even you dislike Uncle Zhang so much?

525
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,010
If we actually get married, you two will be related as well.

526
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,090
If you two become families, your relationship will become more troublesome.

527
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,451
