1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,930

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,330
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,030
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,430
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,590
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,600
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,780

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,780

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,330
Ji Chen, I've decided.

18
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,780
You don't have to go with me.

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,400
I will be a little more comfortable.

20
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,080
Hello, Senior?

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,040
Hello, Tian Tian. I've got the training center you asked for.

22
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,220
It's the one we used to visit every year.

23
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,180
- You mean the one on the coast? 
 -  Yeah.

24
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,740
That one is really nice.

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,240
But about the date, their schedule is tight.

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,940
Only five days of vacancy this month.

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,660
If we miss it, you'll have to wait until next month.

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,700
Hang on. I'll ask about it.

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,600
President Ji, the training center has only five days available.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,220
About our work schedule...

31
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,700
It fits.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,620
Senior, please book the center for me.

33
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,980
What? You want to go with us?

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,160
Of course, yes. You can be our coach.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,260
Remember to give us a discount.

36
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,240
All right, bye.

37
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,780
 He was asking about the love confessions.

38
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,340
 And now he is booking the training center for Tian?

39
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,900
 What on earth is going on?

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,080
President Ji, Brother Yi, I'll go contact and prepare for the training center.

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,300
I'll excuse myself then.

42
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,800
Hold on.

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,220
On second thought, I should go with you to experience the athlete's life.

44
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,340
But you said you wouldn't go.

45
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm your talent manager. Of course, I should go with you.

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,640
- You're the president of Xing Yi. 
 - And you're the pillar of Xing Yi.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,980
- Xing Yi has more than one pillar. 
 - They have their talent managers. They don't need me.

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,220
But they don't make such requests of their talent managers.

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,440
There's always a first time.

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Not necessary.

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,600
You're not used to being turned down.

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm starting to get used to it.

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,780
Anyway, I've made up my mind. It's settled.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll go with you. If you have any requests, speak now.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,820
 How can I make him less annoying?

56
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,600
 Oh! I heard he hates sports

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,820
 and never choose to exercise himself.

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,040
 Got it.

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,030
I have only one request.

60
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,460
You have to experience whatever I experience.

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,480
If you can't make it, then I don't have to do it.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Senior, thank you for especially coming and settling us in.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,560
You can wait at the training center, actually.

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,840
It's all right. You don't have to thank me. You haven't gone there for a while.

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm afraid you have forgotten the route.

66
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,980
How is it possible? We've been going there every year since we were kids.

67
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,820
I can get there with my eyes closed.

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,640
Zhou Tian, check the schedule with me.

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,520
President Ji, I've sent the schedule to your phone.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,660
Double check, double insurance.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,940
You two look cute in couple's clothing.

72
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,360
Not couple's clothing. It's the sportswear from my old sports team.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,660
It's about time. Get in the car.

74
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,140
Then Brother Yi and President Ji share a ride. I'll share a ride with Senior Hao.

75
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,040
Qiao Yi, you stay with Zhang Hao.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,840
You can talk about his experience on the way there.

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,340
Let's go.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Sir, we can set out now.

79
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,940

80
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,060

81
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,540

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,180
 1003: Rest assured. I've got it all set up.

83
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,500
 Your priority these days is to look after the cat.

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,440

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,100
 Don't worry, President Ji. I'll look after her just as I look after you.

86
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,340
These two, please.

87
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,460
Here we are.

88
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,240
When Zhou Tian and I trained here when we were young, the conditions here were much worse.

89
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,060
The whole resort was built in recent years.

90
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,620
For example, this villa.

91
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,340
One single room on the first floor. Two rooms on the second floor.

92
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,560
The third floor has a wide view. And you can see the sea there.

93
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,280
How will you allocate rooms?

94
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll take the third floor.

95
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,840
That room is meant for you.

96
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,060
I-I surely know.

97
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,840
I was just trying to emphasize our unspoken understanding.

98
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,340
Tian Tian, which room do you want?

99
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll take a room on the second floor.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,260
It's close to both the first and third floors.

101
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,940
I'll also stay on the second floor.

102
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,660
 Is there anything special about the second floor?

103
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,760
 They both want it.

104
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,880
You both want a second-floor room?

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,720
Then you two stay on the second floor. I'll stay on the first floor.

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
You choose first.

107
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
It's all right. After you.

108
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,780
This one, then.

109
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,700
By the way, all who enter the center must have a physical examination.

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,020
A nurse will come later.

111
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,540
Now the training center that everyone must have a physical examination.

112
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,740
Why do I need a blood test?

113
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,120
It's to check your body's indicators.

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,980
Very simple.

115
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,740
Look how poised President Ji is.

116
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,220
President Ji!

117
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,280

118
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,360
 I didn't expect such a strong person to have such a weakness.

119
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,360
 Somehow, I feel him cute.

120
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,860
He should be fine.

121
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,020
I'll go prepare lunch.

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,170
I thought he was acting,

123
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,520
but it turned out he has a fear of needles phobia. So fragile.

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,180
That is not correct.

125
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,900
Fear of needles is a common physiological phenomenon,

126
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,380
just like car sickness and seasickness.

127
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,860
It's not because of being fragile.

128
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,380
President Ji, you're awake.

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
You are being too loud. Even the dead will wake up.

130
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,540
President Ji, do you know about your fear of needles phobia?

131
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,840
I do. So what?

132
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,200
You do? Why didn't you tell us?

133
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,140
You don't have to be embarrassed.

134
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,960
Today, if it weren't for my senior, you would have hit your head on the ground.

135
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,360
Who can take the blame?

136
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,600
My fear of needles phobia doesn't attack every time.

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,340
It depends on my mood.

138
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,360
Sounds creepy.

139
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,540
I'm too full.

140
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,520
Let's go for a walk.

141
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,020
What about you, President Ji and Brother Yi?

142
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,320
The blood's concentration in the stomach after eating aids digestion.

143
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,260
Why do you have to make it spread to your limbs?

144
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,460
Ji Chen stays, so I stay.

145
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,560
 Tian Tian, do you remember this tree?

146
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,500
 It's what used to record our heights.

147
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,160
 Right. You remember it.

148
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,100
These are mine. And these are yours.

149
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,600
You haven't come for a long time.

150
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,180
About four or five years.

151
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,520
Want to record your new height?

152
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,900
Okay.

153
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
Stand straight.

154
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,620
Seems you're shorter.

155
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,160
How is it possible?

156
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,600
- See? 
 - Move your hand.

157
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,780
You clearly faked this mark just now.

158
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,340
Senior, since when did you be scheming?

159
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,700
 Silly girl.

160
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,200
 I was just joking with you.

161
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,180
President Ji, what are you doing?

162
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,600
This tree is embracing its death.

163
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,180
 I will have train for over between 500 to 600 days.

164
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,190
 I would do repetition of 6 sets.

165
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,600
 I would train from 2014 to 2016.

166
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,120
The outlet in my room doesn't work well. Can I try yours?

167
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,960
 I will have at most 20 rounds every day and 16 sets of training.

168
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,040
 In June 2016,

169
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,540
 in order to adapt to the climate in Europe early,

170
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,300
 he went back and forth between Dali in Yunnan and Three Gorges in Hubei for cross-country training.

171
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,800
 The daily overload of training on the high-altitude track in Dali made Yu Lei feel...

172
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,900
Thank you for today.

173
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,040
What?

174
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank me?

175
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,960
I fainted at the blood test.

176
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,460
She said you caught me.

177
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,420
Just a lift of the finger.

178
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,860
So, you two have known each other since childhood?

179
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
That's correct.

180
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,020
We were neighbors.

181
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Our fathers worked together.

182
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,540
I entered the Youth Sports School two years earlier than her.

183
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,760
And we came here together.

184
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,300
During these years, she spent more time with me than with her parents.

185
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,540
You've been training there since you were kids?

186
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,100
Yes.

187
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,060
We came to train here every year.

188
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,440
Closed training.

189
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,100
It was rough.

190
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,140
I remember when we came here for the first time.

191
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,480
Xiao Tian ran out at night because of being homesick.

192
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,680
We looked everywhere for her.

193
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,380
I found her on a nearby beach, crying there alone.

194
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,980
 She saw me and jumped into my arms.

195
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,640
 My shirt got soaked that night.

196
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,540
Oh, right. One more thing.

197
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,600
She refused to get up every winter.

198
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
I had to drag her out of bed every time.

199
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,440
I would dress her, and she would nod for another while.

200
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,020
You were always this close?

201
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,380
I said it.

202
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,180
She spent more time with me than with her parents.

203
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,760
No one knows each other better than we do.

204
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,860
Right.

205
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,080
You are like siblings.

206
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,560
Completely real siblings.

207
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,340
Sort of.

208
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,580
My mom always believes she is my family.

209
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,040
I also believe so.

210
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,780
We'll never be separated in this life.

211
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,100
 Are you awake? I miss Qiu Qiu a bit.

212
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,420
 Can I see her now?

213
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,900

214
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,200
Hello, President Ji.

215
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,060
Okay. No problem. I'll get it now.

216
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,900
Qiu Qiu?

217
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,220
I can just take a random track.

218
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,500
Do you have to do it this seriously?

219
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,420
You have to experience it to know the character.

220
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,820
There are a lot of rough trails in cross-country running.

221
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,260
We'll climb obstacles, run through jungles, cross ditches,

222
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,320
and even cross a single-plank bridge.

223
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
 This looks like an easy route.

224
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,560
 Is it really a normal training route?

225
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,960
You are a beginner. You have to start at the junior track.

226
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,780
Take your time.

227
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,900
The environment is complicated here. Be careful, everyone.

228
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,480
Don't get hurt.

229
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,880
Zhou Tian, take a GoPro.

230
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,620
- Record Qiao Yi some writing material. 
 - All right.

231
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,000
Qiao Yi, take one with you.

232
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,160
Zhou Tian is never tired from running.

233
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,100
How is she not tired?

234
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,020
She was an athlete after all.

235
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,220
Look. How beautiful.

236
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,440
A perfect couple. Right, President Ji?

237
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
No.

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,680
They grew up together and fit each other perfectly in sports.

239
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,140
I heard eighty percent of childhood sweethearts turn into couples in the end.

240
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,040
That's nonsense.

241
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,020
Perhaps, they don't see each other now,

242
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,940
but they will approach each other eventually.

243
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,840
This is the magic of love.

244
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,900
Intimacy, see?

245
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,320
I don't understand Zhou Tian.

246
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,980
She doesn't have to work as an assistant in Xing Yi.

247
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,660
Zhang Hao's assistant is a better job.

248
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,660
She can look after him and run with him during training.

249
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,980
What a happy family. So beautiful.

250
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,800
Xing Yi is a subsidiary of Ansheng Group, one of the top ten in the world,

251
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,480
and has the strongest cultural brokerage business in China.

252
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,940
- We— 
 - I didn't say Xing Yi was not good.

253
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,700
Zhou Tian is the most promising employee.

254
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,040
How can she be Zhang Hao's assistant?

255
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,260
I was just saying. You don't have to be triggered.

256
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,620
Hurry up. Or we won't finish it before dark.

257
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,740
Ji Chen!

258
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,380
Zhou Tian, watch out.

259
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,180
Thanks for your helping hand.

260
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,720
You're welcome.

261
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,800
Zhou Tian, the rest stop is just ahead.

262
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,380
Let's sprint for it.

263
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,940
All right.

264
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,580

265
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,660
I'm drained. I can't run anymore.

266
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,800
- Let's take a break. 
 - All right.

267
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,260
Okay.

268
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,220
Thank you, Senior.

269
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,260
President Ji, keep it to yourself.

270
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,360
You are still fast though you haven't run in a long time.

271
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,000
- Come on. You slowed down for me.
- I promise I didn't.

272
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,180
You're all hungry, right?

273
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,820
I'll get us some supplies to regain strength.

274
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,280
- Where's Qiao Yi? 
- I didn't see him.

275
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,040
I thought he was with you running behind?

276
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm not his attendant.

277
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,860
He... He couldn't have ran alone and got lost, right?

278
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,980
Senior, your phone.

279
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,060
The terrain in the mountains is complex. Not easy to navigate here.

280
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,290
No answer.

281
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,700
Calm down. Let's go find him.

282
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,340
All right.

283
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,840
- Qiao Yi! 
 - Qiao Yi.

284
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,900
- Qiao Yi. 
 - Brother Yi.

285
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,420
 Qiao Yi!

286
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,660
- Qiao Yi. 
  - Qiao Yi...

287
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,820
Brother Yi.

288
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,540
Qiao Yi.

289
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,560
Hi. Excuse me.

290
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,380
Have you seen a guy who doesn't look like an athlete

291
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,100
in a rose jacket that looks like straitjacket?

292
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,320
No.

293
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Thanks, anyway.

294
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,780
We're in the mountains.

295
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,880
The passing players all said they hadn't seen Qiao Yi.

296
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
I think we need to split up.

297
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
Then let's split up.

298
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,580
We two will go east. And you go west.

299
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,080
I mean, I'm a stranger here.

300
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,520
If you are not worried I may get lost,

301
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
I can go alone.

302
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,220
All right. Let's split up.

303
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,300
No matter whether we find him or not, we have to get out of here before dark.

304
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,340
After that, we can call the police.

305
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
All right.

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,120
Brother Yi.

307
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,020
Qiao Yi.

308
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,560
President Ji, can you please speed up?

309
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,360
Easy. There's a GPS on Qiao Yi's GoPro.

310
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,340
I can just check it.

311
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,100
Why didn't you say this earlier?

312
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,560
- I forgot. 
- My boss has short memories.

313
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Let me see.

314
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,500

315
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,700
Not far away from us.

316
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,780
He should be...

317
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,840
He should be over there.

318
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,320
Left or right?

319
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,960
Right or left?

320
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Whatever.

321
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,280
I'll take the left.

322
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,980
The ancients respected the left.

323
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,520
Right. To the left.

324
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,820
- Qiao Yi! 
 - Qiao Yi!

325
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,380
But he should be here.

326
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,940
Where?

327
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,120
Qiao Yi's hat!

328
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,900
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes.

329
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,500
So weird. He should be here.

330
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,800
GoPro.

331
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,880
He lost it halfway.

332
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,440
It's a large forest. And so many forks here.

333
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
He can be lost in the forest.

334
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Let's go find him.

335
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,280
Easy.

336
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,080
Qiao Yi.

337
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,660
Qiao Yi!

338
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,940
Brother Yi.

339
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,700
Qiao Yi!

340
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,640
I must be a genius.

341
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,220
Cross-country race.

342
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,380
Outdoor positioning ability.

343
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm completely a human GPS myself.

344
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,220
 Qiao Yi!

345
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,820
 Qiao Yi!

346
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,840
Brother Yi!

347
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,160
Qiao Yi!

348
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,960
President Ji, did you plan this?

349
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,300
W-What did I plan?

350
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,100
I got it.

351
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,020
You are making use of this incident to teach Qiao Yi a lesson. Am I right?

352
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,780
Why would I make use of danger which threatens his life?

353
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,620
I believe you.

354
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
But we really need to find him as soon as possible.

355
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,420
He'll be in danger when it gets dark.

356
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,540
Let's find shelter first.

357
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,140
Over there.

358
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,400
What should I do? It's a cliff.

359
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,100
Rain in the mountains comes heavily, but it won't last long.

360
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,480
I'm fine with it.

361
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,700
I'm not fine with it.

362
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,240
If you get sick, I'll have to...

363
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,380
We'll have to take care of you.

364
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,940
I haven't listened for rain in the mountains for a long time.

365
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,640
Did you often leave for the mountain when raining

366
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,960
instead of staying at home?

367
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,300
When I was young,

368
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,600
my parents ran a farm in the mountains.

369
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,320
When I was back home on vacation,

370
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,660
I would stay a few days in the mountains.

371
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,220
I would run up the mountain even though it rained.

372
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,260
When it rains in summer,

373
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,800
the stream will rise.

374
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,880
The dragonflies are not afraid of getting their wings soaked.

375
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,340
They linger on the water's surface.

376
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,700
Like everything slows down.

377
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,140
Sounds quite interesting.

378
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
I never needed an air conditioner before I joined the Youth Sports School.

379
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,620
It was pleasantly cool in the summer when living in the mountains.

380
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,600
Open my window,

381
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,320
and the wind would blow in.

382
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,420
The longan tree from the next yard reached into our yard.

383
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,560
I could pick some to eat if I opened the second-floor window.

384
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,500
That kind of life is something

385
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,160
that people like you who live in cities

386
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,420
will never experience.

387
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,780
Not everyone can survive hardships as you do.

388
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,640
Exquisite life is also needed.

389
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,640
In case that accident may happen.

390
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,520
President Ji, you cherish your body so much.

391
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,640
And you take so many pills.

392
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,140
Are you born with some terminal illness?

393
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,560
Your phone is ringing.

394
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,820
Hello, Senior?

395
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,820
All right, I see. Got it.

396
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,980
We'll be right back.

397
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,920
He found Qiao Yi.

398
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,360
Great.

399
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,740
It stopped.

400
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,660
Keep it. It's cold after the rain.

401
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,380
I don't need it.

402
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,940
You have a terminal illness. You keep it.

403
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,560
You have it.

404
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,100
What's wrong?

405
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,880
Nothing. I just sprained my ankle.

406
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,840
Sit down. Let me check it.

407
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,000
You don't have to. I'm all right.

408
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,000
Just a sprain. Not serious.

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,860
I said it.

410
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,240
Just a minor injury.

411
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,020
I got a lot of that when I was under training.

412
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,460
What's the story of this scar?

413
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,240
I was injured and had surgery.

414
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,540
So I couldn't do long-distance running again.

415
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,700
Let's go.

416
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,140
Stay still.

417
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,120
President Ji, are you Doraemon?

418
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,740
There are so many things in your bag.

419
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,620
Just my habit. To prevent from incident coming.

420
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,460
And be prepared.

421
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,820
Will you get tired?

422
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,900
My parents died young.

423
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
And I had to take care of my sister.

424
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,540
So I have to take more into my consideration.

425
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,240
When I'm needed, I can offer more help to people I love.

426
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Thank you, President Ji.

427
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,500
I'll carry you back.

428
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,040
No, no. No need.

429
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,980
I can walk by myself.

430
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,440
Let's hurry back. Maybe it will rain again.

431
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,820
You sprained your ankle.

432
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,600
You shouldn't walk.

433
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll carry you on my back.

434
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,060
Come. On my back.

435
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,480
- Be careful. 
 - I will.

436
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,280

437
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,420

438
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,160
Zhou Tian,

439
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,600
where have you been?

440
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,480
It's so late now.

441
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,680
We...

442
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Went to find you.

443
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,840
Where did you go?

444
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,260
I was lost.

445
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,100
I stopped to catch the beautiful scenery.

446
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,180
You were gone when I resumed.

447
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,160
Thank goodness Zhang Hao found me.

448
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,960
What about you two?

449
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,900
We were looking for you.

450
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
Can you please be less self-centered?

451
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,480
Do you know she got hurt when looking for you?

452
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,400
Who got hurt?

453
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,220
It's fine. I just accidentally sprained my ankle.

454
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,640
It can be serious.

455
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
How is it now? Let me see.

456
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,500
- I-I can do... 
 - Don't move.

457
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,980
Zhou Tian, sorry. I didn't mean to get lost.

458
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,800
Sorry.

459
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,900
It's fine. I'm fine.

460
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,900
It's a work injury. I'll be paid for that.

461
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,600
You're fine?

462
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,400
Look at your ankle. How swollen it is.

463
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,920
Not that swollen.

464
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,740
Ji Chen, I think you're being overstrained.

465
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,900
Zhou Tian, why are you blushing?

466
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,440
You two couldn't have...

467
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,760
I blame the lights.

468
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
Leave me alone.

469
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,840
I can make it myself.

470
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:42,100

471
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,060
Do you think they are weird?

472
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,646
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

473
00:38:49,646 --> 00:38:53,606
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:50,284
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

496
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:55,306
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

497
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:59,643
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

498
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:03,906
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

499
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:08,436
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

500
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:18,536
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

501
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:27,636
♫  Shine for you  ♫
