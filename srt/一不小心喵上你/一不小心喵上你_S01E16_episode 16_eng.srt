1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,830

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,930
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,430
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,830
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,130
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,930
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,390
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,660

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,490
Oh, my God. Dad, Mom, your clothes are so fancy!

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,970
- Fancy? 
 - Really? These are new!

20
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,780
Your dad said we had to look fancier than Hao's family. Understand?

21
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,900
Seriously? If others saw you, they might think you would go on a blind date.

22
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,810
You dummy girl. What are you talking about?

23
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,130
But, Dad, coming back to the point,

24
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,680
why do you want Brother Hao and I to be a couple even though you dislike Uncle Zhang so much?

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,980
If we actually get married, you two will be related as well.

26
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,470
If you two become families, your relationship will become more troublesome.

27
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,930
You know nothing about this.

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,550
Experts on TV have said that when you have a son who is not educated well,

29
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,280
he will harm your whole family.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,370
However, when you have a daughter, who is not educated well,

31
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,730
she will harm someone else's family.

32
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,110
So, if I don't like someone,

33
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,350
I shall spoil my daughter, let my daughter marry into his family, and make her harm his family.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Then, my revenge will succeed.

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,050
So, you have to marry into the Zhang family.

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,240
Let's infiltrate our enemy.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,830
Guess I'll disappoint you.

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,730
Pardon.

39
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,830
I said I was afraid you would have a heart attack.

40
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,740
I'll have a heart stent then.

41
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,370
- Two if it's necessary. All right? 
 - Enough for this.

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,220
Both of you. The Zhangs are waiting for us inside.

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,830
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,560
I'll have more if it's necessary. I'm fine with it.

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,950
Sweetie.

46
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,230
Tian'er. You're finally here.

47
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,420
You're slimmer now.

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,150
Tian'er, you're even more pretty now.

49
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,800
- Hi, Uncle and Auntie Zhang. 
 - Sit, please.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,690
Come on. Take a seat. This way. Come on.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Old Zhou.

52
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,250
Is it proper for you to sit there?

53
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,960
Isn't it?

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,170
Isn't it the head of the table?

55
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,400
That's right.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,060
It's you who beg to have my daughter marries into your family.

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,660
As the head of our family,

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,570
is it improper for me to take the head seat?

59
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,400
What do you think?

60
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,110
Old Zhou, what are you talking about? Right?

61
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,000
We are all family.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,340
It doesn't matter which seat we take.

63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,710
Just take a seat. Come on. Sit.

64
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,700
Sit down.

65
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,670
Sit down.

66
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,490
Sit down. Come here. Come.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,220
Just sit.

68
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,590
Take a seat.

69
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,820
Tian'er, why do you sit so far away from me?

70
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,380
Come here. Sit next to me.

71
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,320
I'll just sit here. We'll have a guest come later.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,120
There's no outsider. Zhang Hao will arrive soon.

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,450
Today, we two families gather here to discuss your wedding.

74
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,990
Uncle Zhang, there's nothing between us.

75
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,630
I know you two are doing fine.

76
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,490
But as parents,

77
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,890
we really want you two to speed up a little.

78
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,000
Tian'er, we really hope to have you as our daughter-in-law as soon as possible.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,750
Right. We have been looking forward to that day for a long time.

80
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,280
I have a boyfriend now.

81
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,540
Y-You have one now?

82
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,170
Why don't you bring him with you?

83
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,260
He's on the way here.

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,700
Oh, my dear girl.

85
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,430
My girl's obviously a good liar.

86
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,990
She made it sound so real.

87
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,740
She learned it from you.

88
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,500
Stop this.

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,870
Tian'er. I know Old Zhang is not a kind person.

90
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,440
But his son, grew up under my watch.

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,040
- Good boy. 
 - Totally.

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,550
Don't decline the matter between you two

93
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,230
just because of Old Zhang's problem.

94
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,980
This is not right.

95
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,230
Tian'er, don't listen to his nonsense.

96
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,850
You almost got me.

97
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,750
I have heart disease, you know.

98
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,170
Am I right?

99
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,180
I'm on your side.

100
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,680
If Xiao Hao can be my son-in-law,

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,450
I'll hold a three-day feast.

102
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,150
I'll hold a seven-day feast.

103
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,980
Then, a 15-day feast.

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,920
I will hold a feast that will last for a full month.

105
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,210
I... I'll pay enough for them to travel for a whole year.

106
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,030
- This... 
 - I manage the family finances.

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,690
We'll pay.

108
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,060
- No way. 
 - We...

109
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,300
Sorry, Uncles and Aunties. I'm late.

110
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,380
There was traffic jam.

111
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,170
Please, allow me to introduce myself.

112
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,740
My name is Ji Chen.

113
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,430
I'm Zhou Tian's boyfriend.

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,420
- Boyfriend? 
 - Boyfriend?

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,890
Boyfriend?

116
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,230

117
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,980
Boyfriend?

118
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,440
No.

119
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,430
Don't listen to his nonsense.

120
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,410
Then, why is he here?

121
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,150
Why are you here?

122
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,240
To meet your parents with you, honey.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,130
Where is Xin Xin?

124
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,340
What... Listen to me.

125
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,270
I asked Kevin to give him a VIP card for the resort.

126
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,610
He doesn't need to pay a penny,

127
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,100
but it will be invalid tomorrow.

128
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,930
He's looking for a girl who's willing to accompany him.

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,930
Didn't I make myself clear enough?

130
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,670
Why are you haunting me?

131
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,900
Do you usually treat your helper like this?

132
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,730
Who needs your help?

133
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,350
Not you?

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,050
Since I'm not welcomed here,

135
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,900
I'll leave right away.

136
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,870
Excuse me.

137
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,820
Fine. You can help me.

138
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,740
But you'd better not do anything else.

139
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,790
Right. He is my boyfriend, Ji Chen.

140
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,020
Wait. This...

141
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,960
But y-y-you just said...

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,330
It is just a game between us.

143
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,990
A game?

144
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,350
That's right. I was testing him.

145
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,710
He has a short memory.

146
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,390
So I'm afraid that he will forget me.

147
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,880
Old Zhou, I don't think we can have dinner together.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,660
We... We won't disturb your family dinner.

149
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,890
Old Zhang, we truly can't have dinner together.

150
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,650
I'll go with you.

151
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,770
That's my man.

152
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,670
- Old Zhang. 
 - Old Zhou.

153
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,280
Dad, Mom, Uncle and Auntie Zhou, sorry for keeping you waiting.

154
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,770
This is my girlfriend, Gigi.

155
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,640
Hi, Uncle and Auntie.

156
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,500
- Wait. 
 - What is going on?

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,170
Since when did she become your girlfriend?

158
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,720
Wait. I should be saying that line.

159
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,540
Recently...

160
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,140
Seriously?

161
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,120
Of course.

162
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,020

163
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,760
Look at your boyfriend.

164
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,610
Why is he staring at Zhang Hao's girlfriend?

165
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,610
Maybe their gaze met?

166
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,330
Careful.

167
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,110
Didn't you say she was your girlfriend?

168
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,880
You know each other?

169
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,650
Nope.

170
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,190
Never met before.

171
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,390
You two know each other, don't you?

172
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,980
You two have met more than once.

173
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,120
We met but we don't know each other.

174
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,720
Who will want to know him?

175
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,130
Let's get to know each other today.

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,370
Tian Tian said you were a control freak. You're basically a psychopath.

177
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,520
Being with you is like being in prison.

178
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,720
Neither is free.

179
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,690
I... I have never said so.

180
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,820
A spoiled, current student of the Juilliard School,

181
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,720
instead of going to school, you go to work in a coffee shop.

182
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,340
I do believe you cause lots of trouble for Zhang Hao.

183
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,770
Not really. Not many troubles.

184
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,770
Spiritual abundance is not how many material things you have.

185
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,530
Unlike you, I'm not kidnapped by money. Vulgar.

186
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,260
What makes you believe you, an immature girl, can judge my values?

187
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,610
My ability to think independently.

188
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,040
No one can take away my right to speak.

189
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,720
- You're fabricating the facts. 
 - You're resorting to sophistry.

190
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,790
- You're being unreasonable. 
- You...

191
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,270
Does Zhang Hao like you?

192
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,580
He confessed his love for Zhou Tian not long ago and was turned down.

193
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,070
How is possible that he likes you now?

194
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,330
It's none of your business.

195
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,010
Keep it down.

196
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,840
What is that? Your girlfriend?

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,840
There is nothing between Zhou Tian and me.

198
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,520
We are not together.

199
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,640
But you can't just get a random girl to be your girlfriend.

200
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,300
You heard it. Spoiled.

201
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,850
Left school to work as a waitress.

202
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,890
Is that what a good girl do?

203
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,590
A normal girl won't have a control freak to be her boyfriend.

204
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,710
But you have one.

205
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,660
It's not what you think it is.

206
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,620
Then... Then what is it?

207
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,030
I bet you did something that hurt her.

208
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,640
Or she wouldn't have found a psychopath to be her boyfriend.

209
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm telling you. You two are erring from the right path.

210
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,510
We hope you can realize your errors and mend your ways.

211
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,780
Don't go any further down the wrong path.

212
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,900
We've thought about it.

213
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,990
We think there is no need for you to continue dating that girl.

214
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,760
Guess we have to take the field.

215
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,360
Nian Nian, I'm your brother.

216
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,420
Lower your voice. Are we doing this again?

217
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,790
We talked about it. Don't interfere with my matter.

218
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm not interfering with your matter. I'm care about you because I love you.

219
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,860
Is this how you love me?

220
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,880
Ji Chen. We've talked it over about Zhou Tian and you.

221
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,800
We agreed that Zhou Tian and Xiao Hao will make a great couple.

222
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
- Exactly. Right. 
 - Right?

223
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,370
My daughter, Tian'er was an athlete.

224
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,040
She has a simple mind.

225
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,120
- She can't catch up with your pace. 
 - Right.

226
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,440
So, you two couples are not good couples.

227
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,540
Right?

228
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,320
Yes.

229
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,100
And Xiao Tian and Xiao Hao were together when they trained together.

230
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,500
They know each other well and have the same hobbies.

231
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,780
They should be a great couple.

232
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:44,550
So, as parents, we won't interfere with your love affairs.

233
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,620
But love shouldn't be this complex.

234
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,470
Not complex at all. It's pure.

235
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,390
I can see.

236
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,730
I think you two

237
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,120
will make a perfect couple.

238
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,260
 Right.

239
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,500
- We... 
 - We all think so. 
 - Yes.

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,350
Just now, we were talking about it outside. Right?

241
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,900
There must be something between you two.

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,580
Since you haven't ended your love story, now you can go back to each other.

243
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,790
- Right. 
 - Don't give up on each other

244
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,610
because of Tian'er and Xiao Hao.

245
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,510
- Yes. 
 - Right.

246
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,830
- Right? 
 - Correct.

247
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,330
Ji Chen is my brother.

248
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,810
Biological brother.

249
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,600
Girl, this is a good joke.

250
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,390
Please, listen to me.

251
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,320
We are brother and sister.

252
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,940
From the same parents.

253
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,470
My name is Ji Chen.

254
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,630
And her name is Ji Nian.

255
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,670
No wonder...

256
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,480
 Every two numbers represent one letter according to the order of the alphabet.

257
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,320
 Zero eight represents "H". Zero one represents "A".

258
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,650
 It's my number code. I played code games with my brother a lot.

259
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,170
Dad, Mom, they really are brother and sister.

260
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,510
Gigi, are you really his sister?

261
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,210
Uncle and Auntie Zhou, Uncle and Auntie Zhang.

262
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,290
Tian Tian and Brother Zhang Hao.

263
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,390
My name is Ji Nian. My English name is Gigi.

264
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,570
Ji Chen is my biological brother.

265
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,870
But I choose truth over kinship.

266
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,920
I think Tian Tian is too good for Chen.

267
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,440
This...

268
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,770
Sorry. I lied to you.

269
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,910
I sincerely apologize to you.

270
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,060
Sorry. Forgive me, please.

271
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,980
Look at her.

272
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,770
See? Even his biological sister says so.

273
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,460
Tian'er, think of having Zhang Hao as your boyfriend.

274
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,530
My daughter is a wild girl. And you're a control freak.

275
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,620
No. She may cause you trouble in the future.

276
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,780
How about this?

277
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,060
Zhou Tian and Zhang Hao's matter will still go as we originally planned.

278
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,220
How's this?

279
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,100
Fair enough.

280
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,710
Dad. Uncle Zhang. We have to be serious about marriage.

281
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,160
Ji Chen is a control freak.

282
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,700
I have to explain this.

283
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,240
It's his occupational disease.

284
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,780
He is the CEO of our company. He's born to control.

285
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,090
But he is very thoughtful and considerate.

286
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,000
You know me. I'm always rash.

287
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,420
If it weren't for him, I would have made lots of mistakes.

288
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,880
But I have him now. That's why I'm doing so well.

289
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,610
But, Tian'er, even his sister said he was a psychopath.

290
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,370
Right.

291
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,570
He is just like a psychopath when he loves someone too much.

292
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,470
When he is in love, he will die for his love.

293
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,940
He will give everything to that person and not think about himself.

294
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,230
He's smitten with me in a psychopathic way and will do anything for me.

295
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,620
So considerate his love is.

296
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,550
W-What about the kidnapped by money thing?

297
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,050
Well...

298
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,150
This...

299
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,890
is because he is really good at making money.

300
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,530
He doesn't want to work.

301
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,870
But money keeps chasing after him.

302
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,950
So he's nearly kidnapped by money.

303
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,890
Well, a-a-about this,

304
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,880
he is a better man than your dad.

305
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,000
- And... 
 - Any other questions?

306
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,980

307
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,620
Tian Tian, sorry for not telling you that I am Ji Chen's biological sister.

308
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,850
Do you remember that you gave me a card on my birthday?

309
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,970
It said "Happy" in a number code.

310
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,320
After that, I noticed a painting in Ji Chen's house.

311
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,400
It has "Love" in number code.

312
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,100
This is quite apparent.

313
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,150
And your name, Gigi, is pronounced similarly to Ji.

314
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,980
I should have guessed.

315
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,050
Sorry. I won't do that again.

316
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,540
Luckily that we didn't create chaos. Don't even do that again.

317
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,420
I'll get a taxi.

318
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,750
Why? My brother will drive you home.

319
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,450
I don't want his ride.

320
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,120
 Old Zhang, thank you for dinner.

321
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,250
Come on. I'll take care of you.

322
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,870
Where will you stay tonight? Staying at Zhang Hao's place?

323
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,010
Zhang Hao just renovated his house.

324
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,370
Three bedrooms. All face south.

325
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,660
Outside the window, it's the sea. It's a real sea view house.

326
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,570
We two will take one bedroom. And there's still one. Come with us.

327
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,240
Thanks. But we have a place to stay.

328
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,050
Tian'er's place? It's just a rented house. How big can it be?

329
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,070
It must be crowded. Come on. Let's go.

330
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,890
To live in a real sea view house.

331
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,860
Dad, Mom, get in the car now.

332
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,310
This is... You brat. You bought another new car?

333
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,290
Let's go, Old Zhou. To the sea view house. Let's go.

334
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,270
I don't think so.

335
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,870
The car door I never saw it before. So fancy.

336
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,100
Like a pair of duck wings.

337
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,110
It's all gull-wing doors. It is high-end and fancy.

338
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,750
But when parked in the parking lot, it will have a car on this side, and you can't open the door.

339
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,950
One car on this side, and you can't get out of it.

340
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,750
Not practical at all.

341
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,950
I have a garage at my house.

342
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,650
Hear that?

343
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,570
It must be a villa.

344
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,280
How many bedrooms?

345
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,040
On the first floor, one, two, three, four.

346
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,470
And on the second floor...

347
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
Tian Tian, I'll go first. Bye-bye.

348
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,820
Bye-bye.

349
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,890
Let's go.

350
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,240
What are you waiting for?

351
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,620
I... Can't your boyfriend offer us, your parents, a ride?

352
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,260

353
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,480
To the budget hotel on Mingzhi Road.

354
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,150
Poor environment there.

355
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,300
I booked an executive suite at Coast Hotel.

356
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,810
You can eat well there.

357
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,410
Executive lounge, breakfast, and afternoon tea.

358
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,870
Uncle, Auntie, I'll drive you there now.

359
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,250
No rush. It's still early now.

360
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,330
- We can drive around. 
 - Yes, just go for a drive.

361
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,890
Dad, what are you up to again?

362
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,680
Just go for a drive.

363
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,710
Then, Uncle and Auntie, where do you want to go?

364
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,860
Any recommendation?

365
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,650
Night view on the mountain?

366
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,820
I'm wearing high heels. Not really convenient.

367
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,400
Walk along the beach? Too windy.

368
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,780
I'll have a headache.

369
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,270
We're hoping for a cozy place.

370
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,490
We can sit, and when we're sleepy, we can just lie down and sleep there.

371
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,650
We hope it will be an indoor place. Indoor place.

372
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,690
Say it if you want to go to my place. You don't have to keep dropping hints.

373
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,250
Yours is just a shabby house. I've had enough when video chatting with you. I don't want to go there.

374
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,420
- Then what... 
- What about my place?

375
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,730
You can see the sea there and have a drink.

376
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,980
Most importantly, I have a massage armchair at home.

377
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,450
- No way. 
 - Chen is so considerate.

378
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,880
- That's also what we want. 
 - Let's go to Xiao Chen's place.

379
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,550
Yes, yes.

380
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,760
Gigi, what do your parents do?

381
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,680
I think

382
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,920
they did foreign trade business.

383
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,070
I don't really remember.

384
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,420
Your parents must be really happy to have a son and a daughter.

385
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,400
The boy is tall and handsome.

386
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,960
The girl is natural and graceful.

387
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,760
Auntie, you must be really happy too.

388
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,850
Brother Zhang Hao is an excellent man.

389
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,080
Your mother should be around my age.

390
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,870
No. My mom is not this old.

391
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,940
Your mother must be taking good care of her skin.

392
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,860
I'll ask her about skincare if I get to meet with her.

393
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,710
Where are your parents now?

394
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,290
Wanshou Mountain.

395
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,870
So they've been living in the mountains after retiring?

396
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,330
Maybe Xiao Hao can drive us to visit them someday.

397
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,030
No need, Auntie.

398
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,720
Wanshou Mountain Cemetery is now being cleaned every day.

399
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,850
Your parents are...

400
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,710
Dead.

401
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,990
In a car crash.

402
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,580
Gigi, you should get off.

403
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,440
What?

404
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,900
You said you left something at the cafe.

405
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,730
It's near the cafe. Go.

406
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,010
Call me when you get home.

407
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,160
Bye, Uncle and Auntie.

408
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Bye.

409
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,660

410
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,120
Uncle, Auntie, please.

411
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,710
How huge.

412
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,650
Is anyone home?

413
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,890
It's called the smart home.

414
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,760
This...

415
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,450
Dad, Mom, you've seen his house. Can we go now?

416
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,990
We just arrived.

417
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,570
We should sit down, chat for a while, and have some tea, right?

418
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,040
That's right. Such a fancy house.

419
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,180
We have to get a close look at it.

420
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,730
Uncle, Auntie, make yourself at home. Look at whatever you want.

421
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,020
All right.

422
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,240
We'll have a look.

423
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,040
Let's have a look.

424
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,110
Touch me again, and I'll punch you.

425
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,980
Dad, Mom, hurry. And we can be back to the hotel to rest.

426
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,050
Uncle, Auntie, this way.

427
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,330
Auntie, have some tea. This cup is for Uncle.

428
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,080
How long have you two been together?

429
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,860
Over three months.

430
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,180
You're so capable.

431
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,590
What do you like about Tian'er?

432
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,710
She's smart and aspiring.

433
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,210
She doesn't follow the common template.

434
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,150
She can surprise me every day.

435
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,750
 Now he's talking.

436
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,930
Is she really that good?

437
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,740
But, in the future, you'll have to give a lot of care to look after her.

438
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,520
That's what I should do.

439
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,650
Mom, where is my dad?

440
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,150
It's really late. We should go now.

441
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,160
He went to look around.

442
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,140
It's too huge a house. Is he lost in the house?

443
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,340
He's an old man who suffers from hypertension. Go find him.

444
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,260
We don't want him to get too excited and pass out or whatnot. Right?

445
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,100
Hurry. Go.

446
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,610
Don't be nervous. You don't have to.

447
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,820
Auntie, today,

448
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,330
Ji Nian and I lost our composure at the dinner table. Sorry for that.

449
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,840
It's all right.

450
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,770
You two are justicial and straightforward. Especially Gigi.

451
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,880
She's so outspoken and upright.

452
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,120
If one day Tian'er becomes her sister-in-law, I believe Gigi will help the right party

453
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,090
instead of the closer party when you and Tian'er quarrel.

454
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,160
Ji Nian is a bit rash sometimes.

455
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,280
How... How old are your parents?

456
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,310
My parents died in a car crash when I was 18.

457
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,090
Sorry. I-I didn't mean to.

458
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,260
It's all right, Auntie. You need to know this.

459
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,370
I feel so sorry for them.

460
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,510
We haven't even met each other before...

461
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,100
they pass away.

462
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,420
Dad?

463
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,080
Dad?

464
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,330
Dad?

465
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,100
Dad?

466
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,960
Old Zhang. Do you see?

467
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,590
See this?

468
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,430
This is called a sea view house.

469
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,720
 Listen carefully.

470
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,460
 You can hear waves, right?

471
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,240
 Hear that?

472
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,120
 Even the bathroom has a sea view.

473
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,610
 See?

474
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,010
 Bro, you're so ill-informed.

475
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,140
Three bedrooms mean nothing now. It's out of date.

476
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,650
Facing the sea with spring flowers blossoming.

477
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,850
Dad?

478
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,000
 It can't be he passed out because of hypertension.

479
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,280
Dad? Dad?

480
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,860
Wait a second.

481
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,510
Who is it?

482
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,820
- What are you doing? 
 - I... I am trying to break in to save you.

483
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,720
Save me?

484
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,480
Dad, what were you doing inside? You scared me.

485
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,680
You didn't even respond to my call.

486
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,040
What else can I do inside the bathroom?

487
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm old now.

488
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,610
It's normal for me to use more time.

489
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,710
It's late. Let's leave here now.

490
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,420
 Old Zhou, what's yours is yours.

491
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,550
 What's not won't be yours.

492
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,750
 Tian'er is urging you to go home.

493
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,240
Uncle, stay. Stay as long as you like.

494
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,640
There are so many rooms here.

495
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,480
I don't have time for each of them.

496
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,550
I can't move to a new bedroom every hour, right?

497
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,470
I won't have enough sleep this way.

498
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,930
Uncle, maybe stay for a few days.

499
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,220
Each room a day.

500
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,500
This way, you will have time for all of them.

501
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,820
Let's go downstairs later to input your fingerprints into the system.

502
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,170
Come at any time you want.

503
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,370
Old Zhang. How's this?

504
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,650
What can I say?

505
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,010
You're the fox who doesn't get any grapes.

506
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,030
I feel so sorry for you.

507
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,140
You can only stay in Xiao Hao's small house these days.

508
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,920
You have no choice.

509
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,640
Unlike me. So many bedrooms.

510
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,240
I don't know which one to choose.

511
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,440
Bye.

512
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,300
I'm just saying, all right?

513
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,680
I think your father has a cute personality.

514
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,180
I'm sure we can get along well.

515
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,810
Don't flatter yourself.

516
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:54,320
I won't give your more chance to brainwash them.

517
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,930
I'm taking them to the hotel now.

518
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,480
Wait.

519
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,020
You hear Old Zhou? He sounded so excited.

520
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,500
Like a villain holding sway.

521
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,130
If Zhou Tian was with someone who was inferior to Xiao Hao,

522
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,620
would he show off now?

523
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,200
Zhou Tian is indeed a good girl.

524
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,890
She deserves a good man. Don't say that.

525
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,650
Dad, Mom.

526
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,960
Your son cut these for you.

527
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,200
I know it was a bit of a surprise today.

528
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,560
But Zhou Tian and I are really more like siblings.

529
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,680
Nothing will work out between us.

530
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,930
You have to work on it before something gets to work out.

531
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,410
Let me tell you the truth.

532
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,740
I told Zhou Tian how I felt.

533
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,010
But she turned me down.

534
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,440
I figured it out later. The thing between us is not love.

535
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,560
I'm just used to having her.

536
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,780
Hao'er, it's not like that. It's not just about love.

537
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,910
The most important thing is that you match each other.

538
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,130
What did you say?

539
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,660
No, I mean...

540
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,990
Dad, I have always listened to you since I was a child.

541
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,430
You arranged everything for me.

542
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,040
But this time, I want to choose myself.

543
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,410
All right. I...

544
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,840
I won't force you or Zhou Tian, okay?

545
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,510
But the girl you showed us today.

546
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,860
She is so not the right one.

547
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,300
I'll focus on the worst part. Ji Chen is her biological brother.

548
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,020
At the dinner table, she talked to him like that?

549
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,680
What a temper.

550
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,500
If you married her, I'm sure she would bully you. Right.

551
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,540
- Yes. 
 - Hey. Are you smiling?

552
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
More smile?

553
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,490
That girl is indeed indecent.

554
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,720
- Especially when she talked about her mom. 
 - Yes.

555
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,410
Her words made me so uncomfortable.

556
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,710
Too straight.

557
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,610
Mom, she grew up abroad.

558
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,370
The way she thinks and does things are different from ours.

559
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,980
She's straight and frank.

560
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,310
But she's sincere with people.

561
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,410
I won't accept her.

562
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,240
I'm telling you. You have to break up with her.

563
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,860
- Dad. 
 - I can't watch your ruin life.

564
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,770
This is my own thing.

565
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,080
Xiao Hao, you can ignore his other opinion.

566
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,200
But I think you should accept his opinion about this matter.

567
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,720
I know what I'm doing.

568
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,510
I managed my training and competition when I was on the sports team.

569
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,830
You used to stay out of it. Now just keep out of it.

570
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,930
Wait.

571
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,080
Come. Let me tell you.

572
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,500
I've dug everything out.

573
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,050
He has a house and a car.

574
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,110
But there's one thing I'm sorry about.

575
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,510
Both his parents are dead.

576
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,600
So, in the future,

577
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,060
we have to look after the two kids more.

578
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,240
But Ji Chen is tall and handsome.

579
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,830
Loyal and omnipotent. Obedient and capable.

580
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,310
He doesn't smoke or drink, and seldom hangs out with people.

581
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,730
No first love or romantic history. No bad habits.

582
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,539
So reliable and can be trusted.

583
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:43,039
