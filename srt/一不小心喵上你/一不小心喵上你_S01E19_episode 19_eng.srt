00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,730
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,430
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,130
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,090
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,940

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,660

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,370
Well, you did something, actually.

18
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,480
Do you remember that I logged into your Weibo account

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,050
and replied to your fans?

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,340
A few days ago, I received a message.

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,150
It's from a little girl, named Song Song.

22
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,850
She is ill in hospital.

23
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,130
She needs to receive plenty of treatments every day.

24
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,060
Most of the time, she is confined to bed.

25
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,450
She said that she repeatedly read your book,

26
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,320
feeling that the treatments were less tormenting.

27
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,710
Read this. It's her message.

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,670
 Dear Brother Qiao Yi.

29
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,690
 Hi.

30
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,330
 My name is Song Song.

31
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,560
 I've been your fan for three years now.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,430
I want to thank you

33
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,780
 for giving me the courage

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,730
 at my worst moment.

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,800
 So that I can bravely face my illness.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,290
 I just wanted to tell you.

37
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,030
I think you can go to the hospital to visit this girl.

38
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,450
All right.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,270
I'll go visit her now.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,080
Now it's not a good time. We have to work later.

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,220
Maybe after we finish the interview? I'll accompany you.

42
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,080
All right.

43
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,130
Brother Yi.

44
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,910
Brother Yi.

45
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,080
Qiao Yi, about your future work plan, do you have anything to say?

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,870
Sorry. I don't think

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,990
I can't face my fans on the stage in my current state.

48
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,970
So,

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,180
I'll cancel the book launch and do charity.

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,870
- Cancel? 
 - Why?

51
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,220
 Why?

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,690
But your readers are expecting!

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,510
 I can't face my fans

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,030
 or face anyone who supports me.

55
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,230
 So, I'll cancel the book launch.

56
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,760
What is Zhou Tian doing? Can't she even handle such trivia matter?

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,210
The situation is messy enough. She's making it worse.

58
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,200
Enough. I heard it.

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,420

60
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,380
- Hello? 
 - President Ji, Qiao Yi...

61
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,430
I know.

62
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,370
Sorry, President Ji.

63
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,490
After so many things have happened,

64
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,260
I should have learned and prepared a plan for this situation.

65
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,650
I failed in my duty.

66
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,200
This is who he is. A self-willed man.

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,790
To be honest, he's not really self-willed this time.

68
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,880
 I can see him blaming himself for the Extreme Impala thing.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,170
Li Ang said he has never seen Qiao Yi this sad before.

70
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,690
So, keep him calm now.

71
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,610
 Don't make more trouble.

72
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,770
 Leave it to me. Keep him calm for now.

73
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,980
These two are actually one thing.

74
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,540
When the Extreme Impala thing results clearly, he will figure it out.

75
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,280
Got it.

76
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,030
Brother Yi...

77
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,280
Hi, have you seen Qiao Yi?

78
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,440
He's gone.

79
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,890
Thanks.

80
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,900
Hello, Zhou Tian?

81
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,020
He hasn't come back.

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,370
He doesn't even know how to book a car.

83
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,730
Where can he go?

84
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,540
All right. Let's go find him.

85
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,250
Qiao Yi, where are you?

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,190
Zhou Tian is looking for you.

87
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,510
Do you know how negative the cancellation of the book launch is at this time?

88
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,160
Can you be less childish? How old are you?

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
 Twenty-five years old.

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,750
 But, I want you to accompany me to a place.

91
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,220
Rooftop?

92
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,720
I can take pictures of your dead body.

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,900
 No. It's the hospital.

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,790
You are back. We're having a meeting soon.

95
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm in a hurry. Going to go first. Go.

96
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,390
How's Brother Yi? President Ji has to arrange future work.

97
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,340
The announcement has been released.

98
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,880
The lawyer has gone to the police station to meet with the relevant officers.

99
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,460
Qiao Yi left the launch on the spot.

100
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,100
He didn't even tell me.

101
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,770
Li Ang told me that he was with Qiao Yi. And I didn't have to worry.

102
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,370
He said he would talk to Qiao Yi about the Extreme Impala incident.

103
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,540
So I came back.

104
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,700
Do you want to go home to rest?

105
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,580
I can tell them you haven't come back.

106
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,340
No need. I'll join you at the meeting.

107
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,020
Let's go.

108
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,070
I have read your report.

109
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,600
You're working really hard. Very good.

110
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,560
But the biggest problem

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,030
is how we should tell the truth to the public.

112
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,470
We have released an official announcement,

113
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,810
yet the situation is not getting better.

114
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,900
That's how public opinion flows now.

115
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,920
We have to take out solid evidence.

116
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,700
That's right. We need enough evidence to prove that

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,770
we took the initiative to cut off from Extreme Impala before the incident happened.

118
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,750
Like a lawyer's letter to them or whatnot.

119
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,960
A lawyer's letter?

120
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,030
Zhou Tian, what's wrong?

121
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,710
When I checked the gifts and letters to Qiao Yi from his fans,

122
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,380
I saw Extreme Impala using Qiao Yi's photos as their publicity picture.

123
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,920
So I forwarded it to our attorney.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,200
Did you seriously read those letters from fans?

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,920
I did. As his executive talent manager, checking his fan letters,

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,350
choosing some to reply to, and collecting opinions, these are what I should do, right?

127
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,130
You have done a good job!

128
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,090
Kevin, call our attorney to see if we have sent any letters

129
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,620
or released any announcements about that picture.

130
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,970
All right, I'll call him right away.

131
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,980
All right.

132
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,330
President Ji, the attorney said we released an announcement,

133
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,510
but he suggested we find out the original letter.

134
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,910
Original letter.

135
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,930
Original.

136
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,740
I'll go find it. You continue this meeting.

137
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,350
Zhou Tian.

138
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,980
What are you waiting for?

139
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,050
There are over ten thousand fan letters.

140
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,330
Join her to find it. You're not leaving until it's found.

141
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,910

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,140
This is so difficult.

143
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,220
I don't think I can do this in my whole life.

144
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Brother Qiao Yi, how can you write such excellent stories?

145
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,090
Because I like it.

146
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,220
You can only achieve when you like what you're doing.

147
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,070
That's also what my mom said.

148
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,990
Brother Qiao Yi, since you like writing so much,

149
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,840
why do you refuse to launch the new book?

150
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,740
It's too complicated.

151
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,440
I don't think I can explain this to you in a few words.

152
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,980
If you like my book,

153
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,680
I'll bring my new book to you later.

154
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,480
But

155
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,910
I am not the only one who's expecting your new book.

156
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,230
Every time when you launch a new book,

157
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,230
your stories warm me

158
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,300
and so many others up.

159
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,670
Your stories even moved my mom.

160
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,040
Am I right, Brother Li Ang?

161
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,490
Totally.

162
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,090
Brother Qiao Yi's story can always bring light to people

163
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,050
at their saddest or worst moments.

164
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,690
The sunshine on a winter night? Am I?

165
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,550
I didn't tell you for fear that you might get too cocky.

166
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,650
When am I even cocky?

167
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,150
Totally nonsense.

168
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,010
I get it now.

169
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,680
I was being so self-willed

170
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,820
that I easily canceled the book launch.

171
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,590
Xiao Song, you're right.

172
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,360
I will write as long as there is one person

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,050
who can feel the warmth and sunshine from the joys and sorrows of my books.

174
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,110
Which means you still will launch the new book?

175
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,520
Of course.

176
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,560
And I'm turning the royalties for copyright into a charity fund.

177
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Thank you, Brother Qiao Yi.

178
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you.

179
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,420

180
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,300

181
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,830
Why did he join me in finding it?

182
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:39,140

183
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,160
 I didn't expect this crocodile would look this innocent one day.

184
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,660
 Why do I feel he's kinda cute?

185
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,900
 He has long eyelashes.

186
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,660
 Did he lengthen them?

187
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,520
 His nose, ear, and mouth.

188
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,130
 He's actually cute if I look at him carefully.

189
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,970
 Not inferior to Qiao Yi at all.

190
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,140
 Wait. His lips are too thin.

191
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,740
What were you doing?

192
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,890
I was not doing anything.

193
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,130
Were you trying to steal a kiss?

194
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,770
Who would try to kiss you?

195
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,470
Nonsense.

196
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,920
We were so close.

197
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,730
You would have kissed me

198
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,710
if I opened my eyes one second later.

199
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,960
Y-You are not very clear since you just woke up.

200
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,230
Go back to sleep.

201
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,090
♪ Baby sleep, gently sleep ♪

202
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,170
Stop.

203
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,410
I now know why Qiu Qiu can't sleep at night.

204
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,870
Stop.

205
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,810
I have found it.

206
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,640
Then...

207
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,070
Where are the others?

208
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,410
It's basically settled.

209
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,460
They all went home.

210
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,320
So why are you here?

211
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,230
You were sleeping.

212
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,670
Where is Director Jiang?

213
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,940
Did she leave?

214
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,560
You seem to care about her a lot.

215
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,790
What? Why?

216
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,370
It's just that you two are really close.

217
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,600
You always come and leave together.

218
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,020
It's just a question out of curiosity.

219
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,540
Are you jealous of her?

220
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,570
Apparently you're not awake yet.

221
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,480
Wait.

222
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,130
Jiang Hanyi and I have known each other since childhood.

223
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,950
After my parents died,

224
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,080
half of my life was spent at her home.

225
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,910
She and her parents

226
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,220
treat Nian Nian and me like family.

227
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,180
So to me,

228
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,950
she is also a family.

229
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,960
She's like my second sister after Nian Nian.

230
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,350
W-Why did you say these to me?

231
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,160
It has nothing to do with me.

232
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,270
Sounds so ridiculous.

233
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,970
Zhou Tian,

234
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,180
I did make mistakes.

235
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,420
I want to apologize to you.

236
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,520
Apologize?

237
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,710
Too late!

238
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,770
Can we restart this?

239
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,550
I'll prove to you

240
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,070
that I have learned from my mistakes.

241
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,620
Well... Goodnight.

242
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,170
 I did make mistakes.

243
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,420
 I want to apologize to you.

244
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,900
 Apologize?

245
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,250
 Too late!

246
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,960
 Can we restart this?

247
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,850
 I'll prove to you

248
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,420
 that I have learned from my mistakes.

249
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,090
I'm so sleepy,

250
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,100
but why can't I fall asleep?

251
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,920
It's all his fault.

252
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,290
This is my second sleepless night these days.

253
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,940

254
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,530
 He appears when I think of him.

255
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,610
 Should I accept his friend request?

256
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,580

257
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,160

258
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,530
 So corny.

259
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,060
 Fine.

260
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,680
 I'm not being soft-hearted.

261
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,190
 It's for the sake of Qiu Qiu.

262
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,140

263
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,120

264
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,060

265
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,400
Did you order SSSVVVIP-only breakfast from Kitties' Fairyland?

266
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,070
Yes.

267
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,370
Aren't you Ji Chen's little sister?

268
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,370
Ji Chen has a little sister?

269
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,880
Why wasn't I aware of this?

270
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,010
When have you ever cared about him?

271
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,250
Are you studying at the Juilliard School? So you graduated?

272
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,440
No. I'm still a student.

273
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,970
Perfect. We are looking for a guest performer for the concert.

274
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,530
Why don't you give us some advice?

275
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,780
Me? Really?

276
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,530
But I'm not professional in the band.

277
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,930
You think Li Ang is? He's not professional, either.

278
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,310

Hello?

286
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,380
 Quick! Check the trending topics!

287
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,840
Hold on.

288
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,540

289
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,620

290
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,510
What's going on?

291
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,590
It's said that Extreme Impala's developers once invested in Xing Yi's project.

292
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,180
 What?

293
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,500

294
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,000

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,670
 This news is spreading quickly.

296
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,550
 Now, it has affected the share price of our company.

297
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,770
 Do you have any solution?

298
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,170
I have asked someone to investigate all of our external cooperation contracts.

299
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,160
There isn't any business contract between Xing Yi and Extreme Impala.

300
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,920
Everything on the Internet is a rumor.

301
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,400
I have asked the Legal Department to handle this matter.

302
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,890
 There are many people who want you to resign.

303
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,560
 This rumor spreads too quickly.

304
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,290
 And the comments on the Internet are to your disadvantage.

305
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,700
 President Ji, you have to respond to this matter.

306
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,420
 I don't think so.

307
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,710
 Before the truth comes out,

308
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,320
 President Ji shouldn't give any explanation because very few would believe his words.

309
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,660

310
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,500
Don't worry. President Ji can handle this matter.

311
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,580
If I were you, I wouldn't be so positive.

312
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,570
This scandal has a huge social effect.

313
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,920
It's completely different from those showbiz affairs.

314
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,820
Shut up!

315
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,780
After I came to Xing Yi, I changed the process of signing the contract.

316
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,510
All the contracts must be signed by the agent,

317
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,720
the director of the department, the CFO, the legal personnel, and myself.

318
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,350
After signing the contract,

319
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,880
the Financial Department will keep a copy of it before it takes effect.

320
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,930
These are all the contracts that I signed after I came to Xing Yi.

321
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,150
Take a look at these.

322
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,500
You will know whether I have anything to do with this matter.

323
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,360
 But you are the CEO. You can follow the rules.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,080
 But if you want to break them, I think nobody will dare to object.

325
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,530
 It's said that President Ji is very decisive in the company.

326
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,210
 Now, the rumors are too strong.

327
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,670
 We must give everyone an explanation.

328
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,840
 How about this?

329
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,250
 We'll select an acting CEO from the directors

330
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,460
 before we solve this matter.

331
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,340
 President Chen, I think you're very suitable for this position.

332
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,940
 President Chen, I agree.

333
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,360
 Xiao Jiang. Just in time.

334
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,990
 We're discussing how to deal with Extreme Impala.

335
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,880
I agree with you.

336
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,240
Since you all believe that Ji Chen is the one to blame,

337
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,810
then he can rest for some time.

338
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,230
From now on, I'll be the acting CEO

339
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,660
of Xing Yi.

340
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,450
 You?

341
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,860
 Xiao Jiang, you have just returned from abroad.

342
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,550
 You're not familiar with the domestic market and businesses.

343
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm also a director of the company.

344
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,560
As the CEO, I don't have to be good at everything.

345
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,620
All the professional matters will be handled by more professional employees.

346
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,930
Mr. Chen, are you professional enough to deal with everything?

347
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,180
Ji Chen. Any objection?

348
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,370
Since this is the group's decision, I won't have any objection.

349
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,720
It is a group's decision, of course.

350
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,580
Okay. That's settled, then.

351
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,280
The meeting is over. Please continue your work.

352
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,180
Thank you.

353
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,210
Are you serious?

354
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,730
It's better for me to become the CEO than the others.

355
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,570
You're acting as if this company is yours.

356
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,000
I... You...

357
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,720
I help with your relationship,

358
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,400
and now I even have to worry about your career.

359
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,280
How can you even say that?

360
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,340
You're so ungrateful. I'm sad.

361
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,390
But, seriously, how should we deal with this?

362
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,480
We should talk about it.

363
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,730
I do have a plan.

364
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,230
But I need to borrow your authority.

365
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,750
I love it when you have a plan.

366
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,220
Please tell us, President Ji.

367
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,690
Well, this incident is not that complicated.

368
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,550
We can...

369
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,470
President Ji is suspended!

370
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,690
The announcement is just released.

371
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,740
What?

372
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,680

373
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,310
How could it be?

374
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,760

375
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,980

376
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980

377
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:00,020

378
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,990
Have you read the email?

379
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,080
I hold this temporary meeting to officially explain the situation

380
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,220
and arrange the following work for everyone.

381
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,370
- We... 
 - Director Jiang,

382
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,590
I have a question about the company's decision.

383
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,260
When the Extreme Impala thing just started,

384
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,240
President Ji hadn't become the CEO yet.

385
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,010
Why does he have to be suspended when this incident broke out?

386
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,350
Now, I am the CEO of Xing Yi.

387
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,890
I'm your superior.

388
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,660
I don't have to explain any of my decisions to you.

389
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,600
If you have any objections, you're free to resign anytime.

390
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,220
Zhou Tian, sit down.

391
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,820
- I'm trying to—  
 - I know.

392
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,920
Thank you. Please sit down.

393
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,970
 Seriously? I'm trying to help you, but you're in favor of her?

394
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,320
 Nevermind. I'm nobody to you.

395
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,540
Let's continue.

396
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,230
The group wants us to minimize the negative effect.

397
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,990
The share price can't be affected.

398
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,450
Now, I'll talk about the strategy.

399
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,720
The plan for crisis management...

400
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,660

401
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,930

402
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,760
That's all for today's meeting.

403
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,570
You are dismissed.

404
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,890
President Ji. I think you shouldn't leave the company before the truth comes out.

405
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,350
I have been suspended.

406
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,830
But this matter has nothing to do with you.

407
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,600
It had nothing to do with me.

408
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,740
But now, I'm the CEO of Xing Yi.

409
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,980
I have to be responsible for all the projects of Xing Yi,

410
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,870
including this one. I have to bear the consequence.

411
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,290
That's why we have to find out the truth!

412
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,370
Even if you're leaving, you can't leave like this.

413
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,180
I know you worry about me,

414
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,940
but Jiang Hanyi is handling this matter now.

415
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,690
Worry?

416
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,030
I only seek justice.

417
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you remember what I told you when Qiao Yi was in trouble?

418
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,680
You have to be responsible for your position.

419
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,550
I don't care. You can't leave.

420
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
 She's so cute when she worries about me.

421
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,690
All right.

422
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,290
Actually, this matter...

423
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,970
Kindly reminder. This is my office now.

424
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,080
Director Jiang, you are just in time.

425
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,540
Didn't you say during the meeting that President Ji still needs to assist with your daily work?

426
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,730
So, I think he shouldn't leave for now.

427
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,080
But this office belongs to the CEO.

428
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,350
He has no authority to stay here anymore.

429
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,430
Ji Chen, I have to follow the rules.

430
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,270
I hope you will understand.

431
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,280
Zhou Tian, let's get out of here.

432
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,450
Besides, it's not allowed to gossip during working hours.

433
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,270
This rule also applies to suspended employees.

434
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,690
How was it? She was so protective of you.

435
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,620
Did you enjoy it?

436
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,990
You're welcome!

437
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,800
Where are you going?

438
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,600
Here.

439
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,310
Here?

440
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,080
From now on,I'll be seated here.

441
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,440
This is my desk.

442
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,420
Excuse me!

443
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,030
Excuse me. Put it here.

444
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,670
President Ji, are you joking?

445
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,650
Do I look joking?

446
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,210
By the way, I have just been suspended.

447
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,720
You don't need to call me President Ji.

448
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,420
Call me Ji Chen.

449
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,950
Ji... Chen.

450
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,010
If you feel weird about calling me by my full name,

451
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,560
you can also call me

452
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,610
Chen Chen.

453
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,220
I can't believe you're still in the mood for jokes.

454
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,460
Ji Chen!

455
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,030
Brother Yi!

456
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,710
Ji Chen.

457
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,380
Ji Chen? Have you transformed?

458
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,080
Brother Yi. Are you looking for Ji Chen?

459
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,530
But now, I am the CEO.

460
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,820
It's not a joke. Ji Chen has indeed been replaced.

461
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,620
I don't know you.

462
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,270
Bye.

463
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,190
Zhou Tian, I read the announcement.

464
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,640
Ji Chen has indeed been suspended.

465
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,680
You...

466
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,770
You...

467
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,290
You...

468
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,940
W-Why are you sitting here?

469
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,000
What's wrong? What do you want?

470
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,500
I do want something.

471
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,600
I want to add a program about my new book to Li Ang's concert.

472
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,770
We decided to do charity together.

473
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,410
No problem.

474
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,580
But...

475
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,050
but you're not the CEO anymore.

476
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,500
You're still my agent, though.

477
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,690
I can count on you, right?

478
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,880
Li Ang also works in our company.

479
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,350
It will benefit both of you if you can attend his concert.

480
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,680
The company won't reject your request even though I'm not the CEO.

481
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,480
Okay. That's settled, then.

482
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,530
Zhou Tian, keep an eye on him.

483
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,550
Ji Chen had a rather successful career.

484
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,370
He has never suffered so much.

485
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,910
He might seem very calm right now,

486
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,500
but his heart is badly injured.

487
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,160
I know this kind of man the best.

488
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,870
He does seem weird.

489
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,390
Bye.

490
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,180
Ji...

491
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,330
Ji Chen.

492
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,420
Do you want to go home and rest?

493
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,210
Remember what you said?

494
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,720
I need to stay here before the truth comes out.

495
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,250
I can't leave.

496
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,750
Then go to investigate.

497
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,080
Don't just sit here and throw paper airplanes.

498
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm not the CEO anymore.

499
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,920
How can I find out the truth?

500
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,870
Besides, I have never been this free

501
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,650
ever since I lied for a few months as a baby after I was born.

502
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,940
Since you don't want to see me, I'll leave right away.

503
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,650
I...

504
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,200
I didn't mean that.

505
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,140
What? My brother is suspended?

506
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,280
Jiang Hanyi did this to him?

507
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,180
Jiang Hanyi!

508
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,720
I treated her as my family!

509
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,280
How could she do this to my brother?

510
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,290
I thought she could be my sister-in-law!

511
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,680
I mean... in the past.

512
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,780
That's not important.

513
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,600
The point is, my brother is so proud.

514
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,410
And this is so huge a blow.

515
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,870
Where is he?

516
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,310
This morning, I asked him whether he wanted to go home and rest,

517
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,280
and I said he had nothing to do.

518
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,800
Then, he went home.

519
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,730
He must feel depressed after you talked to him.

520
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,830
My brother is always a busy person, and he never allows himself to be free.

521
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,430
Yet you said he had nothing to do.

522
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,370
Will he commit suicide?

523
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,720
I don't think so.

524
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,620
He tries so hard to live a healthy life,

525
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,720
so he must be afraid of death.

526
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,760
But, I think he's quite weird.

527
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,370
He seems very normal,

528
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,550
but in fact, he's deeply injured.

529
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,230
Xiao Nian called me just now.

530
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,970
She asked me why I suspended you.

531
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,300
Zhou Tian must have told her.

532
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,460
That's exactly what I expected.

533
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,390
You're a professional in toying with women's hearts.

534
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,710
You are the wise one.

535
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,980
You used me to suspend you,

536
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,730
so the mastermind behind it will be off guard.

537
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,050
Then, you can clear them all.

538
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:40,100
As for me, I can help improve your relationship with Zhou Tian.

539
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,782
Impressive!

540
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:46,382
