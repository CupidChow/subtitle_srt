00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:21,180

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,030
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,130
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,030
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,190
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,800
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:47,820

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,640

17
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,440
It's so clean.

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,360
Are you really lost?

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,780
Aren't you full yet?

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,220
There're only a few sashimis left.

21
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,960
Would you like to eat?

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,020
Excuse me.

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,240
Have you seen this cat?

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,180
Nope.

25
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,200
If you see this cat, reach me at this number, please.

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
- All right. 
 - Thank you.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,480
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,560
Excuse me. Sorry to be a bother.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,600
This is my cat.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,840
It's lost now.

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,980
If you see it, please call me.

32
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,340
 All right.

33
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,720
Hi, excuse me.

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,600
This... This is my cat. It's lost now.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,800
If you see it, be sure to call me.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,420
- All right. 
 - Okay.

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,440
You want to leave?

38
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,100
Qiu Qiu,

39
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,580
where are you now?

40
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,620
Qiu Qiu,

41
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,920
come.

42
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,440
Come.

43
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,260
Thank you, Sir.

44
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't thank me.

45
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,300
Just now, a tall and handsome young man brought your cat here.

46
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,540
He just left one minute ago.

47
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,720
I'll go thank him.

48
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,660
Qiu Qiu, give me some hints.

49
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,540
Where did that kind man go?

50
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,460
Over there?

51
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,600
Qiu Qiu, your hint didn't help at all.

52
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,940
There was nobody there.

53
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,160
What kind of hint was that?

54
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Dummy cat.

55
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,900
Also, don't run away again.

56
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,600
Hear me?

57
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,780
Say, I didn't even know how you managed to run out.

58
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,460
Are you actually a cat fairy?

59
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,640
And you helped yourself out?

60
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,360
 It's a decent cat.

61
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,120
 Ate my food, but still chose to go home.

62
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,740
 I advise you to buy a locationing collar

63
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,220
 so that you won't lose it again.

64
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,340
He's quite interesting.

65
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,060
Qiu Qiu, he's making fun of you.

66
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,560
Locationing collar.

67
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,040
That makes sense.

68
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,560
You are Ji Chen, aren't you?

69
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
Qiao Yi? Perfect timing.

70
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,900
I was going to you. Have a seat.

71
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,780
What's the meaning of you changing my talent manager after you took office?

72
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,520
It's a business decision.

73
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,460
Stop the nonsense.

74
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,500
I know you did it as a new broom.

75
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't try to fool me.

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,380
So what do you want?

77
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,480
Get my talent manager back.

78
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,300
She didn't follow the strategy formulated by the company,

79
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,600
regardless of long-term influence and brand value,

80
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,880
and tempted you to write eye-catching works that might affect your long-term development.

81
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
The head office talked to her twice,

82
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,680
but she refused to change.

83
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,360
Is there a problem with Lucy attracting more readers for me?

84
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,980
We made a lot of money for the company.

85
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,860
Your recent two last two short stories have pretty good CTR  (Clickthrough Rate)

86
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,920
and attract some fans for you.

87
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,160
But many old readers are very dissatisfied with these two.

88
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,680
They think

89
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,240
you are no longer

90
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,200
the detached writer who can bring them peace and serenity.

91
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,620
You're too fixed on hot topics.

92
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,020
Moreover, you speculated at will

93
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,680
and made subjective comments without investigating,

94
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,520
which caused adverse effects on the parties involved.

95
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,400
I don't believe it.

96
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,980
Facts don't change just because of your opinion.

97
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,740
I'll be your talent manager.

98
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,980
To help you work positively as a public figure.

99
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,500
I won't allow you to chase after any trend to increase short-term CTR.

100
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,040
My team has disbanded. Can't I panic?

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,900
I'm building a new team for you.

102
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,120
They'll be ready in three days.

103
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
It won't affect your work.

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,660
- But I only want my old team. 
 - No way.

105
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,020
- Then I will terminate our contract. 
 - All right.

106
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,500
Pay the liquidated damages which are 20 times your salary,

107
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,400
and we can terminate the contract.

108
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,040
What? Why 20 times my salary?

109
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,840
Half a year ago, when Lucy renewed your contract,

110
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,080
she raised it to 20 times your salary.

111
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,900
Didn't she tell you about it?

112
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,240
 Hello, Zhou Tian. I have good news for you.

113
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,280
 There's hope you can join Xing Yi!

114
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,480
What?

115
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,020
Lucy took Qiao Yi's core team away.

116
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,920
Now they need to build a new team

117
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,700
 and an assistant for the talent manager.

118
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,280
Assistant for the talent manager?

119
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,380
Do you think I, a green hand, can do this?

120
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,140
Logically, you can't.

121
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,240
But you know Qiao Yi.

122
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,980
He's been working the hardest at Xing Yi.

123
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,720
Basically, everyone in our company is serving him. Including President Ji.

124
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,460
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

125
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,120
 Qiao Yi doesn't get along with President Ji.

126
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,540
So if you can get Qiao Yi's nod,

127
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,260
you can be on his team.

128
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,540
But I have to meet him at least.

129
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,520
This is the problem we have to solve.

130
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,120
We have to make Qiao Yi notice you and recognize you.

131
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,620
Xiao Xia, I have an idea.

132
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,360
 I've done my homework.

133
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,280
 Qiao Yi will be here to shoot for his new book.

134
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,540

135
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,200
Zhou Tian, you clever girl.

136
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,700
You even thought of meeting Qiao Yi to discuss face-to-face.

137
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,480
Never try to stop an athlete.

138
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,740
And I'm on your boss' hit list right now.

139
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,400
I have to do it this way.

140
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,080
Or I won't enter Xing Yi my whole life.

141
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,560
You're witty.

142
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
But remember. You snuck in on your own.

143
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,580
I didn't help any bit.

144
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,260
Brother Yi, let's take a break.

145
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,260
Relax.

146
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,560
Chin up. You're the best.

147
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,180
Go, girl.

148
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,440
You can do this alone, right? I have to get back to work.

149
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,400
Hi, Qiao Yi. My name is Zhou Tian.

150
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,740
I know you're looking for an assistant for your talent manager.

151
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,920
So I want to ask for a chance.

152
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,600
Here's my resume.

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,160
To me? Why?

154
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,740
Interesting.

155
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,360
Do I look like an interviewer?

156
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,000
I've submitted a resume online to Xing Yi.

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,300
But I don't have much job experience.

158
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,820
I don't have any advantage.

159
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,200
And you're really popular, after all.

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
I heard that you would look after rookies.

161
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,880
So I thought I had to come to see you

162
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,640
and show you my sincerity and determination before I actually failed.

163
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,720
At least I gave it my best.

164
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Quite proactive.

165
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,960
Yesterday, they told me a lot of people applied for this position.

166
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
No wonder you panic.

167
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,260
Give it to me.

168
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,060
Excuse me.

169
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,980
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

170
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,780
Ji Chen, you came just in time.

171
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,920
This girl came to me for a job interview.

172
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,620
I don't have time for her.

173
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,020
You're my talent manager. You handle this.

174
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,460
I told you Xing Yi wouldn't accept you.

175
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,160
"Xing Yi wouldn't accept you."

176
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,380
You think you're cool when you're saying this, right?

177
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,560
But it only proves you're dictatorial and cheap.

178
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,380
Picking a quarrel with Ji Chen?

179
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,220
 She's got some nerve.

180
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,000
As a first-class cultural brokerage company,

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,620
Xing Yi has its all employees selected.

182
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,960
And you are not qualified at all.

183
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,160
You're recruiting an assistant for a talent manager.

184
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,340
The person will mainly serve Qiao Yi.

185
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,820
But you don't respect Qiao Yi's opinion at all.

186
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,740
He's been working for years.

187
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,600
He knows how to select an assistant.

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,640
He's not someone you can control.

189
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,080
Don't think too highly of yourself.

190
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,280
Most of the people are not qualified.

191
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,400
You're just one of them.

192
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
Well, the worst one of them.

193
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,440
I don't want to explain to you.

194
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,920
Please, leave. Or I'll call security.

195
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,320
No.

196
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,140
I think she has a point.

197
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,760
The assistant is for me.

198
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
I do believe you need my opinion.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The company will screen two rounds of interviewees and give you the final list.

200
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
No bother. I'll take her.

201
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,040
No.

202
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,720
Are you saying I can't even choose who works for me?

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,020
Anyone but her.

204
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,960
She's a jinx. Anyone around her will be cursed.

205
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm doing this for you.

206
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,160
Only you're cursed, right?

207
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,580
The more you stop me,

208
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,860
the more I look forward to her entry.

209
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,740
Brother Yi, we're ready now. We can start.

210
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,920
You're not allow to tell her to leave.

211
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,960
We'll talk after I finish shooting.

212
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,380

213
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,940

214
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,480

215
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,630

216
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,720

217
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,340

218
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,920
- President Ji.  
 - President Ji.

219
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,900
- You okay, President Ji? 
- President Ji.

220
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,860
Indeed cursed.

221
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,100
No one can't lower our bar for her.

222
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,420
Is it because of the bar or your prejudice?

223
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,820
Not prejudice. It's me being professional.

224
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,220
What if I insist?

225
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,860
- She can't join Xing Yi no matter what. 
 - I can hire her personally.

226
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,540
Every employee around you has to be approved by the company.

227
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,000
President Ji, she's super agile and has a golden heart.

228
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Isn't that acceptable to the company?

229
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
Fine.

230
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,120
You tell him about your educational background and occupational history.

231
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,020
What is wrong with my education?

232
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,660
Communiversity.

233
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,600
Better than 70% of people in our country.

234
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,480
And that's not my specialty.

235
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,100
I was an athlete.

236
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,780
Why don't you ask me about my performance in the running?

237
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,980
The way you speak is really annoying.

238
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,580
Good point.

239
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,000
He can always make people annoyed.

240
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,960
You said it yourself. This is not your specialty.

241
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,380
You know nothing of working as the talent manager of a writer.

242
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,740
Why should I give you this job?

243
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,660
Do you start to work as a baby?

244
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,780
I need time, and I'll grow to be an assistant.

245
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,040
Good point. Very good.

246
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,860
I think Zhou Tian is very reasonable when expressing opinions.

247
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,240
President Ji, how about this?

248
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,940
You think she's inexperienced.

249
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,380
Then why don't you get the old assistant back to me?

250
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,600
No one knows me better or is more experienced than him.

251
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,740
How's that? Make your choice.

252
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,240
All right. I choose her.

253
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,860
But you, think clearly.

254
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,980
You're applying for the position as the assistant to Qiao Yi's talent manager.

255
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,440
That means you're my assistant.

256
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,100
If my memory goes correctly, my last assistant was in therapy for three years

257
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,520
after working with me for three months.

258
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,860
So, think this through.

259
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,280
- I'm not afraid of you. 
 -  Good.

260
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,860
Start to work from Monday. Three months as your probation period.

261
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,720
You have to leave if you fail.

262
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,080
Happy now?

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,660
This trifle wasted five of my precious minutes.

264
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,440
I'll go back to work.

265
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Thank you, Brother Yi.

266
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,700
You can do this. Don't be afraid.

267
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,420
I'll look after you.

268
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,300

269
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,820
- Hello? 
  - President Ji, I got another health alert from your wristband.

270
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Since I have received it too frequently recently,

271
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,020
I arranged an in-depth medical examination for you on Saturday.

272
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,660
Why aren't you taking any action since you received it?

273
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,200
And I'm not getting examined until Saturday?

274
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,780
President Ji, don't rush. I can hear your angry tone

275
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,240
 that you're absolutely healthy.

276
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,260
 Did you forget it? Don't panic no matter what's happening.

277
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,020
 That's what you told me.

278
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,720

279
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,020

280
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,500

281
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,100
Tian Tian, are you sure to start recruiting now?

282
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,860
Aren't you starting next week?

283
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,220
There's a probation period. You don't have to write it now.

284
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,260
You are not sure if you can go through the probation yet.

285
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,760
Can you stop frustrating me?

286
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
Say something nice!

287
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,200
Well, hire a girl?

288
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,700

289
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,300
What's your problem this time?

290
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,240
No... Look at that girl.

291
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,800
Don't you think she's a little weird?

292
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,300
There are so many vloggers nowadays, and they shoot anywhere.

293
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,900
What's weird about that?

294
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,200
But in our shop, shouldn't she shoot the kittens?

295
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,680
Maybe she's a newbie and still in the exploratory stage?

296
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,560
Hi.

297
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,300
Hi, can I get you anything?

298
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,020
Sorry. I just thought about shooting and forgot to buy something.

299
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,080
Shoot? What did you shoot?

300
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,960
Well... I want to ask you something.

301
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,320
Lady, you got so many trophies in the shop.

302
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,640
Are these yours?

303
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,740
- Or yours? 
 - No...

304
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,700
They are not ours but our boss's.

305
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,920
He's a cross-country runner.

306
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,960
 Oh, my. This is really Brother Zhang Hao's shop.

307
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,500
You said just now that you want to ask me something?

308
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,200
I'd like to apply for this job.

309
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,980
Aren't you hiring? I'm applying.

310
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,620
Look at your help wanted requirement, it's like tailored for me.

311
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,560
Adults only... I'm 22.

312
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,980
Likes animals... I used to have a cat.

313
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,960
Knows how to make coffee... I can make desserts.

314
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,640
It's delicious... I can make one for you right now.

315
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,320
You... You're so good at selling yourself than I am.

316
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,440
Will you hire me?

317
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,460
Please.

318
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,720
I'll let you give it a shot.

319
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,540
But after the probationary period, the boss will decide.

320
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,960
Thank you, Sister. I'll do my job well.

321
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,560
I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Gigi.

322
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,760
I'm Zhou Tian.

323
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,040

324
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,800
 I originally wanted to come back to relax

325
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,580
 and think about the future direction of my life,

326
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,700
 but I didn't expect I could meet Brother Zhang Hao here.

327
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,440
 He's my favorite athlete.

328
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
 But I remember him saying he didn't like to be disturbed.

329
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,780
 I should keep a distance from him and do my job well.

330
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,080
Qiu Qiu. From tomorrow on, I'll work at Xing Yi.

331
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,140
Although I'll be in the Literature Division Department,

332
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:51,020
I believe that with my effort, I'll soon be able to transfer to the Sports Division Department.

333
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,320
However, Ji Chen will definitely try to find fault with me,

334
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,640
so I have to do my job carefully!

335
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,880

336
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,280
The clock-in time is 9:00 am.

337
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,660
Then I'll set the alarm clock

338
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,320
at 6:00 am.

339
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,400
I can go to work at 6:30 a.m. and arrive at the office at 7:00 a.m.

340
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,760
I'll be there two hours early,

341
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,300
so you can't nitpick me on that.

342
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,280
Go to bed.

343
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,600
Nighty-night, Qiu Qiu.

344
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,740

345
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,760
What are you doing at midnight?

346
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,640
Please call for promoting after 8:00 a.m.!

347
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,720
I was asleep, can you have some humanitarian spirit?

348
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
 It's Ji Chen.

349
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,280
- President Ji. 
 - About Qiao Yi's job offers next week,

350
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,780
I've filtrated them once and emailed you the result.

351
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,140
Organize it into a tabulation in the format attached.

352
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,300
Get it ready before working time.

353
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,260
What email?

354
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,640
Your email account and the password were sent to your Enterprise WeChat.

355
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,480
President Ji. I haven't been onboard yet.

356
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,580
 You should start working today.

357
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,940
It's 5:00 am on Monday, you're one of Xing Yi for five hours.

358
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,360
As a talent manager, you have to be on stand-by around the clock and work year-round.

359
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,160
You can quit if you can't do it.

360
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,180
I can do it.

361
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,940
Ji Chen. You must pay for this!

362
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,890
 This one is our Meeting Room No.1.

363
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,960
And we got Meeting Room No.2, No.3...

364
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,180
We have many meeting rooms.

365
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,960
 We have many meetings every day.

366
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,140

367
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,680
Is this Sports Division Department?

368
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,540
Yes, it's Sports Division Department.

369
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,080
That's Literature Division Department.

370
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,120
That's our department.

371
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,340
And on the opposite is the Department of Market Development,

372
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,220
Project Department, and Performing Arts Department.

373
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,940
This floor is all for business departments.

374
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,380
Like the Administrative Department, the Personnel Department, and IT, are all upstairs.

375
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,200
Here we are.

376
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,100
Literature Division Department Ⅰ.

377
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,680
That's your desk. And I'm opposite you.

378
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,860
What else do I have to be careful of?

379
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,360
No?

380
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,020
Well...

381
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,060
To be President Ji's assistant, you should be careful of everything.

382
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,400
And I can't make it clear in words.

383
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,120
It's all right. I'll just roll with the punches.

384
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,100
Things eventually sort themselves out.

385
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,220
Even if they don't, I'll figure them out.

386
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,960
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

387
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,940
I'll get going now.

388
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,860
Was she comforting me just now?

389
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,420
But she's the one who's going to suffer.

390
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,400
President Ji. I'm here to report.

391
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,920
Go to the nearby handmade bakery to buy three ice-cream croissants.

392
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,060

393
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,800
Why're you standing there?

394
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,500
If you can't be back in half an hour, don't come back at all.

395
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,860

396
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,500
Xing Yi Building, please.

397
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,480
 We recommend customers have this croissant right after it's made,

398
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,080
 so we don't have insulation bags. Sorry.

399
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,480
I got 16 minutes left.

400
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,860
 The rest of the way is about five kilometers.

401
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,960
 I can run five kilometers
in 15 minutes.

402
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,020
Sorry, Sir. I have to get out of the car right now.

403
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,300
 Ready!

404
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,920
 Go!

405
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,560
 Thank you, President Ji.

406
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,540
 It's my duty.

407
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,500
You're so generous, President Ji.

408
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,920
You got the chef here.

409
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,940
Ice cream croissant only tastes the best when you have them right after it's made.

410
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,040
Then why did you ask me to buy it?

411
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,160
As a talent manager, you should always have a Plan B.

412
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,300
Plan B...

413
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

414
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,440
- Hi, Qiao Yi. 
  - I bought a pair of shoes, and they were sent to the office.

415
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,020
Please bring it to my house. I want to wear them later.

416
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,960
All right. I got it.

417
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,460

418
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,440
Zhou Tian, what are you doing in the mail room?

419
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,600
You're sweating.

420
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,660
Don't bring it up. I'm helping Qiao Yi find his delivery.

421
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,780
There are so many deliveries. And I finally got this.

422
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,840
Let's go. It's lunch time. Let's go eat.

423
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,040
No, I can't. I have to take this to Qiao Yi.

424
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,480
He rushed me three times.

425
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,070
 Come to the meeting room.

426
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,140
Put it on my desk, thank you.

427
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,160
Is this what an assistant should do?

428
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,840
It's totally what a talent manager should do!

429
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,800
Our main topic today is market share.

430
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,840
Xing Yi's market share...

431
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,240

432
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,880
We have to continue the meeting at noon, please order lunch for us.

433
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,320
All right.

434
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,260
Tell her what you want.

435
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,940
Beef with oyster sauce, set A, no green pepper.

436
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,820
Tomato soup with egg, no salt.

437
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,880
And a drink, no juice.

438
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,140
I want braised beef, set B, with more sauce.

439
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,660
Vanilla mix chocolate ice cream.

440
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,360
And a bowl of sweet dew. Thank you.

441
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,140
I need sweet sour pork, set A, and the pork should be tender.

442
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,360
And a room-temperature coke. Right, a separate glass of ice.

443
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,760
And I don't like disposable tableware.

444
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,820
I'll have the pork knuckle rice, set A.

445
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,920

446
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,340
I have found the shoes, and I'll bring them to you immediately.

447
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,800
 In half an hour. I need them.

448
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,340
Sorry. Can you repeat the rest? I just got a phone call.

449
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,440
I just got a call and didn't pay attention to it.

450
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,160
Beef vermicelli soup with cilantro and green onions, no chili.

451
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,980
Beef salad, no green onions, and cilantro, with a little vinegar.

452
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,380
Fried rice, no green soya bean or carrot, but with some pickled cowpea.

453
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,040
Two vegetable soups, one with no bacon, and another with less oil.

454
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,360
Do I have to repeat it a third time?

455
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,560
I recorded it.

456
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,860
 Want to embarrass me? So boring.

457
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,800
 I have no workplace experience,

458
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,140
 but I have watched a lot of TV series.

459
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,320
We need to have milk tea at the afternoon meeting,

460
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,420
get us some passingly.

461
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,300
The address of the milk tea shop and the restaurant,

462
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,700
I'll send them to your Enterprise WeChat.

463
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,240
We're all hungry. You got half an hour.

464
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,480
Let's go on.

465
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,980
It's too late to order take-out.

466
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,320
It has to take at least 40 minutes to deliver them.

467
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,280
I have to go take them myself.

468
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,100

469
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,880
Oh, no.

470
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,060
He did it deliberately.

471
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,880
These two shops are in the opposite direction.

472
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,400
Qiao Yi's shoes...

473
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,800
Why is everyone so obsessed with the half-hour time node?

474
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,060
Are you sure I don't have to ask the recipient to sign for it?

475
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,560
Is it true that there are celebrities living in the Huacheng Residential?

476
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,420
Just do as the note said. That's none of your business.

477
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,180
Quickly.

478
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,260
All right.

479
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,780

480
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,480
 Did you send Qiao Yi a city-flash delivery?

481
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,080
 Cancel it.

482
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,560
Cancel it?

483
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,400
Then Qiao Yi's shoes...

484
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,800
Don't make me repeat it. Cancel it right now!

485
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,760
What about Qiao Yi's shoes?

486
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll deal with it.

487
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,100

488
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,340

489
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,940
Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting.

490
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,640
You only bought food? Where's the milk tea?

491
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,720
I...

492
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,620
I don't want an explanation.

493
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,380
If you can't make it, you can ask your colleagues to help you.

494
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,460
You're right, President Ji.

495
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,600
Everyone, here's the milk tea.

496
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Zhou Tian, come to my office.

497
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,260
Which one would you like to have?

498
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,840
Do you know why I asked you to cancel the delivery?

499
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,120
I was just about to ask you, President Ji.

500
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,080
Qiao Yi's address is confidential to the company.

501
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,100
It should never be leaked.

502
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,300
But I used a fake name and left my phone number on it.

503
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100
I also left a note.

504
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,320
Just call me when it is delivered to the door.

505
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,540
No need to sign for it.

506
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,340
Qiao Yi won't have to meet the rider, and his address won't be leaked.

507
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,940
All the riders and delivery guys who come here know what we're working at.

508
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,100
They are much smarter than you.

509
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
I don't want to argue with you. Just obey my orders.

510
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,260
You'll be fired if you make the same mistake again.

511
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,860
I get it.

512
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,240
Follow this template to collect information

513
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,780
about the development trend of EX,

514
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,340
and the information about all the brands. Qiao Yi has endorsed since he debuted.

515
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,540
All right.

516
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,160
I want it tomorrow morning.

517
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,040
All right.

518
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,700
At 5:00 a.m.

519
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,060
At 5:00 a.m?

520
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,780
So early?

521
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,120
 This... So I have to stay up for work all night?

522
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,820
 Why is he so fond of 5:00 a.m.?

523
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,960
 What's special about this time point?

524
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,140
You can refuse if you don't want to. I won't force you.

525
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,060
I'll make it!

526
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,420
Why are you here again?

527
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,980
 Qiu Qiu, where are you?

528
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,460
You naughty boy, are you running away from home again?

529
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,000
You're so like Nian Nian.

530
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:38,080

531
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,580
Your owner must be as worried as I am.

532
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,222
