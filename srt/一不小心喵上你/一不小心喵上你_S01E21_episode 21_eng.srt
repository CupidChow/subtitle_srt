1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,030

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,830
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,230
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

7
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,430
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,690
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,490
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

12
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,800
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,920

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,580

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,000
 Say yes!

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,140
- Let me go. 
  - Say yes!

19
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,100
 Say yes!

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,180
You said it, remember?

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,520
It wasn't your idea.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,840
You didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,680
It may not be my idea, but it's my fault if I have angered you.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,320
Say yes!

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,980
Zhou Tian.

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,940
I will apologize to you right here in front of all the everyone here.

27
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,500
I want to be with you.

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,640
Right here, right now.

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:39,660
 Say yes!

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,180
 Say yes!

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,300
Great!

32
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,800
But... some other time.

33
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,120
How do you like that unexpected romantic love story?

34
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,060
Now, I'm going to go get changed.

35
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,980
Well, the entire country knows about us now.

36
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,280
I think it's great.

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,840
I want the whole nation to feel my sincerity.

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,580
Zhou Tian. I know that you were pretty upset

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,740
because I hid my identity 1003 from you before.

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,320
And now, Jiang Hanyi and I played tricks on you.

41
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,800
- Zhou Tian. 
 - That's fine. You can stop explaining.

42
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,860
The truth is, I'm not a petty person.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,860
So, you are not mad at me anymore?

44
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,480
No.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I wasn't mad in the first place.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,580
I just wanted to see how you reacted.

47
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,720
About this concert,

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,700
I have made my promise online.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,880
We will take part of the ticket sales to establish a charitable fund.

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,000
It will be dedicated to helping sick children.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,260
It was an ill fan of mine who gave me such an idea.

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,520
Her name is Song Song.

53
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,460
When I lost my life direction, Song Song made me realize my value.

54
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,120
 Hey, everyone. I'm Song Song.

55
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,460
She made me realize that I can't just enjoy your attention and admiration.

56
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,480
I should give back to society as well.

57
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,500
Now, welcome my guest singer, Gigi!

58
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,220
Hello, everyone. I'm Gigi.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,200
I have a question to ask.

60
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,940

 You're welcome to become keeper No.2 of Qiu Qiu.

70
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,840
 Talent Managers are not magicians that can make things out of nowhere.

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,380
 They are coaches who must work hard to train the actors and actresses, and push them to the front.

72
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,860
 I'll send you a message after I choose the restaurant.

73
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,520
 I'll see if I can find you among strangers.

74
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,500

So beautiful.

89
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,280
Yes. Now, I understand what you said before.

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Talent managers are not magicians that can make things out of nowhere.

91
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,760
We are coaches.

92
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,060
We must work hard, advance with our principals, and push them to achieve and succeed.

93
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,760
Ji Chen, thank you.

99
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,100

100
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,140
Will Brother die?

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,840
Don't worry.

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,260
He'll be fine.

103
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,400
We will wait here for him.

104
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,680
Was that a heart attack?

105
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,400
He has congenital heart disease.

106
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,500
My grandpa used to do outdoor sports all the time.

107
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,440
He loved rock climbing.

108
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,370
He had a heart attack while climbing,

109
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,300
and he fell off a cliff.

110
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,920
We never found his body.

111
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,280
That day when my dad had a car accident, he went surfing.

112
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,660
But, on his way back home, he also had a heart attack.

113
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,100
That's how the car accident happened.

114
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,720
I should have been more considerate.

115
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,500
He's been careful all the time.

116
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,680
And I thought he was being pretentious.

117
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,540
We have been busy preparing for the concert and book launch lately.

118
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,920
He didn't sleep well.

119
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,280
Brother, you must survive this.

120
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,700
You have to.

121
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,220
Zhou Tian. Gigi.

122
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
This is Ji Chen's lawyer.

123
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,640
Hello. I'm Yan Liang, the director of the Administrative Committee of Ronghai Will Bank.

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,280
Hi.

125
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,640
Why is he here?

126
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,000
The will bank is not just about keeping wills.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,780
It also keeps blessing messages, family videos, and help with announcing wills.

128
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,220
With full respect to our clients' will,

129
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,640
we help our client's families to complete their legal procedures for property inheritance.

130
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,300
Mr. Ji Chen gave us instructions.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,000
He asked me to announce his will if he became unconscious due to his poor health.

132
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,880
His will?

133
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,680
My brother is not dead. Why are you talking about his will now?

135
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,300
First, I will play this video that Mr. Ji Chen left for you.

136
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,260

137
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,900
 Nian, today is your wedding day. You must be happy.

138
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,480
 I don't know who will marry you,

139
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,460
 but he is lucky to have you.

140
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,220
 You tell him.

141
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,000
 If he dares to hurt you in any way,

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,860
 I will haunt him down even if I'm dead.

143
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,460
- Wait. 
  - Nian Nian,

144
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,480
 today is your wedding day,

145
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,920
 but I won't be there for you.

146
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,720
 I'll protect you from heaven.

147
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,720
 Please delete this part.

148
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,100
 Let's make another one.

149
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,700
Sorry, that isn't the right video.

150
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,580
This one is.

151
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,300
 Zhou Tian.

152
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,600
 I apologize

153
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,940
 if my arrogance and uncontrollable affection for you affected your life.

154
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,860
 I hope you can forgive me, considering I am dead now.

155
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,220
 Meeting you

156
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,920
 was unexpected and the best surprise my life gave me.

157
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,320
 I thought I could live every day peacefully.

158
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,560
 I was ready to accept a sudden death.

159
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,980
 But Qiu Qiu and you came to my life.

160
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,600
 I began to look forward to a future with you.

161
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,140
 Anyway, there will be no Ji Chen anymore.

162
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,700
 You must forget about me.

163
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,120
 After all, I'm the crocodile that gave you a hard time at work.

164
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,460
 Well, that's about enough.

165
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,850
 I hope you can meet someone who loves you more than I do

166
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,180
 to spend your life with.

167
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,740
 I wish you happiness.

168
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,840
 I'll love no one but you.

169
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,500
Entrusted by Mr. Ji Chen, I now announce his will.

170
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,100
Miss Ji Nian will inherit 45% of my assets, fund, and corporate stock.

171
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,400
Miss Zhou Tian will inherit 45% as well.

172
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,300
The last 10% will be living expenses for Qiu Qiu.

173
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,260
Miss Zhou Tian will keep this part on Qiu Qiu's behalf.

174
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,120
Meanwhile, Miss Zhou Tian will have my car so that she can travel around easily.

175
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,040
Miss Zhou Tian and her cat Qiu Qiu will have my house and live there together.

176
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,000
About Kevin...

177
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,700
Well...

178
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,420
Mr. Ji Chen is awake.

179
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,680
What did President Ji give me?

180
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,980
Wait... Sorry.

181
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,380
There are few assets left.

182
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,740
President Ji...

183
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,120
Brother, you scared me to death.

184
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,380
You are scaring me now.

185
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,000
Where is Zhou Tian?

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,580
Tian Tian.

187
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,560
Don't worry.

188
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,580

189
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140

190
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,220
His case is quite typical.

191
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,200
Take a look at this.

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
See? This blood vessel is here.

193
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,840
And this side is blocked.

194
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,460
This is...

195
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,500
Doctor, is there any problem?

196
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,600
You can tell us.

197
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,520
What?

198
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,760
He's hopeless now?

199
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,140
He won't survive?

200
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,520
He should be discharged.

201
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,740
Doctor, we won't go.

202
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,880
You can't send a man with a fatal disease home. He will die.

203
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,780
Fatal disease?

204
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,320
When did I say he has a fatal disease?

205
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, you shook your head just now...

206
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,140
There is nothing wrong with his report.

207
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,200
But you then shook your head again...

208
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,380
I shook my head again because you asked me if he's hopeless now.

209
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,760
I meant to say no.

210
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,440
So, he is...

211
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,160
He passed out because of fatigue.

212
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,180
His body couldn't take it anymore.

213
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,680
And his brain suffered from insufficient blood supply.

214
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,960
He must make changes so that such things can be prevented,

215
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,560
and his current condition won't become worse.

216
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,280
You need to arrange your work and life reasonably

217
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,000
based on your own conditions.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,300
Keep a nutritious diet.

219
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Keep a balanced diet.

220
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,100
Recover your body gradually until you are back to normal condition.

221
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,880
You can go through the discharge formalities now.

222
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,420
Make sure you have plenty of rest at home.

223
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,260
My body requires me to remain still.

224
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,600
Brother.

225
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
You are here together.

226
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,600
Tian Tian told us you are discharged.

227
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,760
So I asked Brother Zhang Hao to drive you home.

228
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,360
Why are you alone? Where is Tian Tian?

229
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,280
Gigi. Senior.

230
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,940
Tian Tian, what's this about?

231
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,300
He wants a wheelchair.

232
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,240
What? He can't walk himself?

233
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,160
He wants to rest.

234
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,920
The doctor said he was fine. He just needs some rest.

235
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,420
Therefore, he decided to follow the doctor's instruction by resting and remaining still.

236
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,220
If you sit for too long, your blood won't circulate well, which may cause myophagism on your legs.

237
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,600
Be careful. You might not stand up again.

238
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
It's all right.

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,560
I have asked Kevin to find me a private masseur.

240
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,020
I'll get a regular massage every day at home.

241
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,040
Brother, you are exaggerating.

242
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,980
The doctor said you are fine.

243
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,180
You don't have to be over-cautious.

244
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,020
There are some genetic diseases that medical equipment can't detect.

245
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,260
Did you forget how our grandpa and our dad passed away?

246
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,020
They both died of congenital heart disease.

247
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,360
Gigi! You...

248
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,060
The women in our family don't inherit this disease. And I like sports.

249
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
Ji Nian.

250
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,700
You should go home with me.

251
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,640
Why?

252
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,020
I'm your brother, and I need someone to take care of me.

253
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,880
You must go with me.

254
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,860
No. The shop is in need of help. I have to stay there.

255
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,360
I can get you a nurse.

256
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,820
That won't work.

257
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,760
It only works well when you come and take care of me yourself.

258
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,420
Pretentious.

259
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,440
I don't care. You must go take care of me.

260
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,780
No. You're being unreasonable.

261
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,480
I can take care of Ji Chen.

262
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,060
No, Tian Tian.

263
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,340
After all, he's my brother.

264
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,340
It's my duty to take care of him.

265
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,360
I can't let a bad-tempered girl like you to take care of me.

266
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,420
Go leave us alone. I don't want to see you.

267
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,040
We can take care of him together. We can help each other.

268
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,280
I...

269
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,980
I...

270
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,860
Pass.

271
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,740
Ji Chen is becoming a control freak again.

272
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,680
I won't let him have his way.

273
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,300
This time, I won't compromise.

274
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,480
You can leave now. I don't need you.

275
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,100
You may give me a heart attack.

276
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,200
Fine. Since you don't want me, I'll leave, as you wish.

277
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,280
Bye.

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,460
Zhang Hao, go check on Ji Nian.

279
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,440
You shouldn't have been mean to Nian Nian.

280
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,560
My blood pressure is high again.

281
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,980
You want to lie down?

282
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,440
I like this better.

283
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,560
Gigi.

284
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,380
Brother Zhang Hao.

285
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,300
Are you all right?

286
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Yes. My brother is pretending to be weak.

287
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,720
He wants Tian Tian to care for and hug him.

288
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,380
I see.

289
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,800
Well, will you go back to the shop?

290
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,740
I'll go there later.

291
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,060
I have to meet a producer and discuss some business.

292
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,000
Do you need me to drive you?

293
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,320
No.

294
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
The subway station is right there. I can take the subway.

295
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,040
Fine.

296
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,860
Be careful.

297
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,420
All right. We are home.

298
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,660
I'll ask the nurse to come over and keep you company tonight.

299
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,120
I don't like strangers at my home.

300
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,980
I need to go home.

301
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,360
I have everything here.

302
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,380
But I don't have any clothes here.

303
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,580
What... What are these?

304
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,680
President Ji. I have prepared everything for her.

305
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,520
I bought pajamas, sportswear, business wear, and underwear.

306
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,020
As you requested, I bought all sizes.

307
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,600
Good.

308
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
I won't go in here. Good night.

309
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,680
It's not dark yet.

310
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,020
Why did he say good night?

311
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,280
That's a lot of stuff.

312
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,740
It's quite cold now.

313
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,520
I can't wear this.

314
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,720
Kevin is so bad at this.

315
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,960
It's perhaps because he only shops for himself usually.

316
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,280
He doesn't have much experience in buying lady stuff.

317
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,920
I should go back to my place.

318
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm a patient that no one wants to take care of.

319
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,600
My sister doesn't want to come home with me.

320
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,200
And now, my girlfriend doesn't want to accompany me either. She is leaving me as well.

321
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Where is this going?

322
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,400
It's all right. I can be alone.

323
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,940
You can go home.

324
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
How do I make this work?

325
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,840
I...

326
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
I didn't mean that, Ji Chen.

327
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,180
Well, Xiao Tian Tian.

328
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:21,740
Please stay and accompany me since I'm so pitiful.

329
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,980
All right.

330
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,520

331
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,280
What are you looking at, Brother Hao?

332
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,280
Nothing.

333
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,160
Gigi told me that she was going to meet a producer to discuss business.

334
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,660
But she's not back yet.

335
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,800
Can you tell me if that is a male producer?

336
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,680
Brother Hao, you have changed.

337
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,840
You are acting exactly like a miserable second female leading in a romantic play.

338
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,960
Stop that. I'm just caring for my employee.

339
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,740
If we are in a romantic play, I should be the second male lead, all right?

340
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,820
All right. Then, Gigi will be the second lead.

341
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,400
You two can make a couple.

342
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,720
You're back.

343
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,060
Brother Zhang Hao.

344
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,240
How was the business discussion?

345
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,400
It went well.

346
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,340
That producer liked the songs I put online.

347
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,770
Not only did he want to sign up me with big money,

348
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,300
but also had he made a plan for my singing career.

349
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,240
He wants to sign you?

350
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,120
Then... that means you will debut in the entertainment industry.

351
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
You will leave me...

352
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,640
leave my coffee shop.

353
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,020
Well,

354
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,580
I'll stay as long as you ask me to.

355
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,600
This is your chance.

356
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,060
I...

357
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,280
think it's a great opportunity.

358
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,820
It's good to be in showbiz.

359
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,780
This shop welcomes you back any time.

360
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,740
It will be a pity if you give up your career.

361
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,840
Don't be so serious.

362
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,680
Rest assured. I have declined his offer.

363
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,840
Why?

364
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,600
I'm still young.

365
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,020
I need to study more.

366
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,880
If I do want a talent manager, I will go find Tian Tian.

367
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,800
We're about to close, right?

368
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,940
If you don't need me here, I'll go upstairs.

369
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,240
Brother Hao, don't you think Gigi is a bit off?

370
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,440
She is? How?

371
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,870
Come on. Do you really need me, a master of relationships,

372
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,080
to stoop down and explain this to you?

373
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,340
That wasn't about the business. The business was only a cover.

374
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,140
Gigi basically told you herself.

375
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,480
She wished you could ask her to stay.

376
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,440
Why didn't you take the initiative?

377
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,980
But I didn't know.

378
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,660
Plus, I can't just talk her into this.

379
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,280
How could she know your feelings if you don't tell her?

380
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,700
Think about it. You liked Zhou Tian for so long.

381
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,060
But you only told her your feelings after President Ji showed up.

382
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,560
That was too late.

383
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,160
President Ji was brave and resolute.

384
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
That's why he got Zhou Tian.

385
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,920
You have to be resolute, in terms of the relationship.

386
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,780
Tell me.

387
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,340
I liked Zhou Tian a couple of months ago, but now, I like Gigi.

388
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,440
Does it make me a bad man?

389
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,900
Your heart wants what it wants.

390
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,500
It only takes you one second to decide whether to love someone or not.

391
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,220
You lost your chance with Zhou Tian.

392
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,500
Do you want to lose Gigi as well?

393
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,960
We're not the same kind.

394
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,800
We shouldn't be together.

395
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
What a nice excuse.

396
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,150

397
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,580

398
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,580
 He didn't even ask me to stay.

399
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,560
 So, this is it.

400
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,260
 I'll go back.

401
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,020

402
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,820
Brother, you are a man. Why do you keep nagging me?

403
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,800
I have been quite busy at the shop lately.

404
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,540
When I'm done here, you can come and pick me up.

405
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,280
I won't miss out on school.

406
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,740
Bye.

407
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,640

408
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,600
I think I'm done here, except for saying goodbye.

409
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,720
♫  Whatever matters to me will make you feel the same  ♫

410
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,340
♫  Whatever surprises me will make you laugh  ♫

425
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,020

426
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,140
 Street lamps,

427
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,240
 thank you for lighting up my way every day.

428
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,600
Ji Chen, where are the seasonings?

429
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,640
Right beside your hand.

430
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,200
Do you have any meat?

431
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,820
Nope. But I can order some right now.

432
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,940
Can you help me here?

433
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,880
I wish I could. But the doctor said I need to rest.

434
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,540
It's burnt.

435
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,720
Let's order some food, all right?

436
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,400
No. Take-out food is unhealthy.

437
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,780
What do you think we should do?

438
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,940
Perhaps you can try again.

439
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,260
I really hope I can help you.

440
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,840
But I have to listen to my doctor and rest well.

441
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,440
I have to stay still.

442
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,560
Fine.

443
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
You can keep resting.

444
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,400
Are you sure you won't regret it?

445
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,160
Yes, I'm sure.

446
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't.

447
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,980
That water is getting cold. You can have this one.

448
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,080
Come on. Open your mouth.

449
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,040
Careful. It's hot.

450
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, how do you like resting?

451
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,660
This is what my life is supposed to be.

452
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:55,560
I got the rest I deserve, and I can enjoy your meticulous care.

453
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,420
I will take good care of you.

454
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,780
We will follow the doctor's instructions and keep healthy.

455
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,940
Time for the meal.

456
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,040
Sit there.

457
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,680
What's for breakfast?

458
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,600
Seafood feast.

459
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,380
Go ahead.

460
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,820
- S-Seafood? 
 - Yes.

461
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,800
I made more for your sake.

462
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,660
You are the patient. You must keep a light diet.

463
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,040
What now?

464
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,820
You can eat multiple times a day but less food each time.

465
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,040
Let me have some more.

466
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,960
No. We must attach great importance to your health.

467
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,700
Zhou Tian.

468
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
That's all for my dinner?

469
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,680
You can't eat too much in the evening.

470
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,420
These fruits will help reduce your intestinal burden.

471
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,520
I think my food can be more diverse.

472
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,460
These red fruits look bland.

473
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,260
They are food, not art work.

474
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,080
Red food is conducive to promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.

475
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,620
They are good for your heart. They can clear your blood vessels and prevent arteriosclerosis.

476
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,240
They are perfect for patients with a genetic disease like you.

477
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,840
Come on. Have one.

478
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,500

479
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,140
- Zhou Tian, are you going eat them all? 
 - No.

480
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,720
- Can I... 
 - No. You can't have unhealthy food.

481
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,280
But life is about trying something new.

482
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,080
Nope.

483
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,180
Zhou Tian, can I go to work tomorrow?

484
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,940
Nope. You have to rest.

485
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,480
I...

486
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,140
So good.

487
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:27,030

488
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:33,264
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

489
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:37,224
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

490
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:41,904
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

491
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:47,134
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

492
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:52,394
♫  Finally, you've came into my life  ♫

493
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,782
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

494
00:38:55,782 --> 00:39:00,599
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

495
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,904
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

496
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:10,634
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

497
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:14,204
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

498
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:18,604
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

499
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:23,799
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫

500
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:30,341
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

501
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:34,334
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

502
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:38,955
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

503
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:44,162
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

504
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:48,659
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

505
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:52,664
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

506
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:57,254
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

507
00:39:57,254 --> 00:40:07,034
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

508
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:16,534
♫  Shine for you  ♫

509
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:25,234
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

510
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:29,196
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

511
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:33,847
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

512
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:38,934
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

513
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:43,318
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

514
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,464
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

515
00:40:47,464 --> 00:40:52,190
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

516
00:40:52,190 --> 00:41:02,194
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

517
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:11,394
♫  Shine for you  ♫
