1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,180

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,030
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,230
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,130
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,330
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,990
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,390
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,700
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,580

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,660
Xiao Nian called me just now.

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,380
She asked me why I suspended you.

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,720
Zhou Tian must have told her.

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,620
That's exactly what I expected.

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,900
You're a professional in toying with women's hearts.

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,240
You are the wise one.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,300
You used me to suspend you,

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,240
so the mastermind behind it will be off guard.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,400
Then, you can clear them all.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,500
As for me, I can help improve your relationship with Zhou Tian.

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,680
Impressive!

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,600
I only heard stories like the hero saves the beauty.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,040
I didn't expect the table to turn now.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,920
Was Zhou Tian adorable when she was jealous?

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,460
To think carefully, you are also adorable.

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,340
You can get nine points from me.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
Nine points?

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm so flattered.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,520
But my dear Tian Tian deserves 1,000 scores.

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,480
Spoil her to death! Keep doing it!

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,640
Henpecked man!

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,480
Well, stop the nonsense.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,160
How are the documents I asked you to sort out?

41
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,600
Here.

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,900
It contains all the contracts of investments and financial details

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,520
in the past two years.

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,980

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,320

46
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,960

47
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,500
 Hi, Zhou Tian.

48
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,980
Hi, Xiao Xia. Here's the thing.

49
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,820
Did your company ever invest in a film named Phantom City?

50
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,320
I guess it's from Zhou Tian.

51
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,220
I'm warning you, don't mess it up.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,720

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,480
Zhou...

54
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,220
 I just found that some victims of Extreme Impala set up a group chat to defend their rights.

55
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,480
 I managed to join the group.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,880
 I pored over their chat history.

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,180
 I found that it was a film project named Phantom City that involved Xing Yi.

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,960
 It's said to be invested by both Xing Yi and a company from Hollywood,

59
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,000
 and it has three episodes.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,180
 Qiao Yi is the leading scriptwriter.

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,540
 I'll send you a PowerPoint.

62
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,160
 It's the program description of the film.

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,380
-  It's their principal means of financing.  
 - Program description?

64
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,940
 Many people invested in the film.

65
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,260
 And the program description contains the confirmation letter signed by Qiao Yi

66
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,720
 and the official seal of Xing Yi.

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,960
 But it was signed before you came to Xing Yi,

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,160
 which firmly proves that you are out of this matter.

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,740
I see. I'll look through the PowerPoint.

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,080
Keep yourself out of everything.

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Well, that's it. Good night.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,540
What?

73
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,220
I spent so much energy finding you the information,

74
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,620
but you actually hung up the phone.

75
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,420
Stupid crocodile!

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,540
Why did I bother to worry about you?

77
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,940
I won't show you any concern even if you lose your job.

78
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,860
Whatever! I'm going to go to sleep.

79
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,980
Why are you so nervous?

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,000
I wouldn't make her misunderstand you.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,960
Just in case.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,440
It appears that Zhou Tian really spares no effort to help you.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm jealous. So sweet.

84
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,080
Let me have a look at the program description.

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,900

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,960
Another restless night.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,860
Xin Xin, a cup of the strongest coffee, please.

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,600
President Ji?

89
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait...

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,840
I...

91
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,460
Am I not awake yet?

92
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,480
W-Why is he making coffee?

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,700
My brother said he was informed by Jiang Hanyi that

94
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,760
he was suspended from his duty from today on.

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,620
So he came here.

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,230
And told us to leave all the work

97
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,800
of the café to him today.

98
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,840
He made a commitment to double the turnover of the café today.

99
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,340
Suspend his duty?

100
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,480
Based on what Jiang Hanyi did this?

101
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,060
President Jiang is the CEO of the company now.

102
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,620
She has the final say in the company affairs.

103
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,720
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's your coffee.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
Please enjoy it.

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,440
No, I have to talk to Jiang Hanyi.

106
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,180
Brother,

107
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,920
I seem to sense the smell of conspiracy.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,340
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,040
You once hurt Tian Tian and were blacklisted.

110
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,220
Don't piss her off anymore.

111
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,640
I really did nothing. I don't know what you are talking about.

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,160
Even though it wasn't your idea,

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,220
you're an accomplice.

114
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,380

115
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Come in.

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,700
President Jiang, have you seen the PowerPoint?

117
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,940
Yes.

118
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,180
I noticed that the producer's name was on the program description.

119
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,180
So I think you should meet the producer with President Ji.

120
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,960
He must know who gave him the confirmation letter with Qiao Yi's signature.

121
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,960
You don't have to be involved in this.

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,880
President Jiang, President Ji is Qiao Yi's agent,

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
and I'm Qiao Yi's executive talent manager.

124
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,380
Qiao Yi was involved in this incident.

125
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,000
If we don't deal with it at the earliest speed,

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,360
the thing will go viral like it did last time.

127
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,320
Even if President Ji is no longer the CEO of the company now,

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,780
he's still Qiao Yi's talent manager.

129
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,500
If he is replaced, Qiao Yi's approval is at least necessary.

130
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I have confirmed the thing with Qiao Yi on my way this morning.

131
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,160
 Zhou Tian, Ji Chen is still my talent manager now.

132
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 He is the mere handler of my affairs.

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,480
 Whoever wants to expel him should get my approval.

134
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,040
 Without my approval, no one could make it happen.

135
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,100
So we are extending to you our earnest desires in the disposal of the incident

136
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,760
as soon as possible on behalf of Qiao Yi,

137
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,320
lest the larger negative effects would be made.

138
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,340
How lovely you are.

139
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,500
Want some candies?

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,980
No?

141
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,860
I understand what you meant.

142
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,740
You just want me to know that

143
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,200
I cannot drive Ji Chen away as my pleasure.

144
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Do you like him?

145
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,180
What you have done for him has gone far beyond

146
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,960
what an employee might feel for a boss.

147
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
He's my boss,

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,560
and I have learned a lot from him.

149
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,380
It has nothing to do with my affection for him.

150
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,160
I don't think he should be treated with injustice.

151
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,560
I hope you are not taking deliberate aim at him.

152
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,660
The reason I asked him to take over Xing Yi

153
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,380
was to have him accumulate some performers,

154
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,140
so that I can take him back to the headquarters.

155
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,840
My father thinks highly of him.

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,200
He will be one of our family in the near future.

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
But it was surprising to me that

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,560
he totally forgot why he started.

159
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,860
So I must remind him of his initial intention.

160
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,940
Without my support,

161
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,600
he would lose everything.

162
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,120
Don't you think you're selfish?

163
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
What does it matter to you what I do to him?

164
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,560
Who are you to him?

165
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,520
I'm nobody to him.

166
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,020
But I think he really cares about the job,

167
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,980
and wants to do everything to make Xing Yi a brighter future.

168
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,380
If you understand him,

169
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,140
or care about him,

170
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,660
you would never treat him like this.

171
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,160
I believe that he won't yield to you.

172
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,700
In your mind, confidence can solve every problem in the world?

173
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,020
I'm confident about Ji Chen.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
She's adorable!

175
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Your sweetheart came to me just now.

176
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,000
She's got some personality.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,700
I like her!

178
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,380
Zhou Tian, I got the information of the producer named Liu Siliang

179
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,480
who you asked me to inquire about.

180
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,240
He works in Starry Films now.

181
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,120
I'll send his phone number to you later.

182
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,500

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
Great!

184
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
Thanks!

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,640
- You owe me one! 
 - You bet!

186
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,380
Ji Nian, where is your brother?

187
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,540
He left in a flurry after answering a phone call.

188
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,460

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,100

190
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,000

191
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,700

192
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,160
Ji Chen is not at home.

193
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
Where has he been? I have some urgent business to tell him.

194
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,540
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. Good night.

195
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm invited to be a guest at your concert?

196
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,880
Okay. No problem.

197
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,160
It's my pleasure.

198
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,120
Great.

199
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Bye.

200
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,980
What concert? Is it Qiao Yi's?

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,740
Boss, Gigi will get famous soon.

202
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,900
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,920
Just a small guest performer.

204
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,260
Don't be that modest.

205
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,100
The video posted by Qiao Yi has spread all over the Internet.

206
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,680
Not long after, your identity will be exposed on the Internet.

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,980
Don't forget us when you become a star.

208
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,480
When is the concert? We'll cheer for you then.

209
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,500
Good. I'll reserve two positions of the best view for you.

210
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,280
- Morning, Zhou Tian. 
 - Good morning.

211
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,460
- Morning. 
 - Good morning.

212
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,420
Hello, good morning.

213
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
- Morning, Zhou Tian. 
 - Morning.

214
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,260
What are you doing?

215
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,180
Standing here at this early hour.

216
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm waiting for someone.

217
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,710
Who?

218
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,320
Bad news! Bad news!

219
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,780
I saw President Ji, President Jiang, President Chen,

220
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,200
and some other shareholders went into the meeting room just now.

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,640
Director Kevin said it would be President Ji's final trial today!

222
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,580
What?

223
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,380

224
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,480
Xiao Jiang, the headquarters thought

225
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,700
the negative influence of the incident shall be reduced to the minimum.

226
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,760
So we have to announce publicly

227
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,460
the suspension of Ji Chen's duty.

228
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,660
We suggest that the announcement be made today,

229
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,540
with the promise that we'll have a thorough investigation of the matter.

230
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,320
This is the announcement we have drawn up.

231
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,420
Please have a look.

232
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,220
If you are all right with it,

233
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,020
post it right away.

234
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,540
Uncle Chen,

235
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,140
I promise to preserve the right of shareholders with all my forces.

236
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,760
But I have to add some items to the announcement

237
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,160
to make it more practical.

238
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,600
We should publicize the latest investigation result.

239
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,900
What result?

240
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,980
The only connection between Xing Yi and Extreme Impala

241
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,920
was that Extreme Impala recommended

242
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,980
a film called Phantom City

243
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,000
to the investors as a financial product

244
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,080
in the name of Qiao Yi being the producer.

245
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,540
This is the program description of the film.

246
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,660
The confirmation letter signed by Qiao Yi is included.

247
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,580
Xing Yi is also on the list of their producers.

248
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,320
However, I have confirmed that

249
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,940
Xing Yi has never signed the contract with Qiao Yi,

250
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,400
nor any investment contract.

251
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,860
You should ask Ji Chen to explain.

252
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,000
He is Qiao Yi's talent manager.

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
He must have been in charge of the matter.

254
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,600
The document appeared in the group chat of Extreme Impala at the earliest

255
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
at the end of last year,

256
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,400
earlier than the time I took over Xing Yi.

257
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,680
So you mean

258
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
the document is fake?

259
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,660
No.

260
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,840
I have checked that

261
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,940
the official seal on the contract was true.

262
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,560
It suggests that

263
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,240
it was made by someone inside Xing Yi.

264
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,660
Qiao Yi's talent manager back then was Lucy.

265
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,940
And he said that

266
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,860
Lucy asked him to attend Extreme Impala's party.

267
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,720
You passed the buck to a former employee.

268
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,800
Have you confirmed it with Lucy?

269
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,080
Did she admit it?

270
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,900
She turned off her phone, and her whereabouts remain unknown.

271
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,380
So? What's the point of your proof?

272
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,700
It didn't make any difference.

273
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,680
Though her whereabouts still remain unknown,

274
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,800
I have found the producer on the paper.

275
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,120
I got his recordings.

276
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,720
Producer?

277
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,120
Please, we all are pretty busy.

278
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,500
We don't have much time to watch your show.

279
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,100
If you do have the proof, show it to us.

280
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,400
Uncle Chen is right.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
 Can you explain the whole thing to us?

282
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,140
 The project doesn't exist at all.

283
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,480
 Extreme Impala asked me to make a film for them.

284
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,340
 They said Qiao Yi would be the scriptwriter, and wished that I could do the budget.

285
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,060
 I was afraid it was a trap,

286
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,340
 so I asked to have a face-to-face negotiation with Qiao Yi's talent manager.

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,860
 They showed me a confirmation letter with Qiao Yi's signature.

288
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860

289
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,260
 I wasn't completely convinced,

290
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,580
 with the fear that it could be a fake one.

291
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,260
 So I asked my friend to contact Lucy.

292
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,700
 Lucy confirmed it with me in person.

293
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,260
 We had the meeting a few times,

294
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,220
 and started to talk with actors and actresses.

295
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,900
 They then said it wasn't urgent.

296
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,000
 They needed a program description from me.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,920
 I wasn't secure then,

298
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,260
 so I told them we should first put it on record in the National Film Board.

299
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,000
 I need them to offer the letter of investment confirmation.

300
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,500
 I heard them make a phone call to a man,

301
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,940
 who was President Chen from Xing Yi.

302
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,140
 That President Chen said he would deliver the letter with the seal to us.

303
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,280
 Have you met President Chen?

304
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,460
 After the meeting that night, they had dinner together.

305
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,200
 I wasn't invited.

306
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,080
 But I saw President Chen come.

307
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,980
 I gave them the stamped document.

308
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,620
 And they copied one and sent it to me.

309
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,500
 Then, they went for dinner.

310
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,460
 Later, I realized that this project was entirely infeasible.

311
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,960
 They promised to sign the contract but didn't.

312
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,980
 So, I dropped the project.

313
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,220
President Chen. Please explain yourself.

314
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,740
What do you mean?

315
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,540
Just because of this recording?

316
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,500
Are you implying that I'm the guy he mentioned?

317
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,960
First, I'm not even sure whether this sound recording is authentic.

318
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,260
Besides, how did he know

319
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,280
that President Chen was the actual president of Xing Yi?

320
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,200
As far as I can see it, you arranged this person.

321
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,500
Well, we can get him up here and let him speak.

322
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,180
He's waiting in the car downstairs.

323
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,360
You have two options now.

324
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,340
We can let the police have him, and they will take over the matter.

325
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,540
Or you tell everyone here what happened.

326
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,780
Uncle Chen. Don't be nervous.

327
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,840
My father and you have been good friends for so long.

328
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,700
Last night, I told him about you.

329
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,920
He thought that as long as you admit and turn in the money,

330
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,680
we will handle this ourselves.

331
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,420
Otherwise, we will call the police.

332
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,200

(T/N: 110 is the equivalent to U.S. 911)

333
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,640
You have 10 seconds.

334
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,080
One, two...

335
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,160
Seven...

336
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,560
What? That's way too fast.

337
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,840
Nine...

338
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
Fine.

339
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,280
I'll admit it.

340
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,120
Back then, Extreme Impala reached me.

341
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,300
They said they could turn film and television projects into financial products.

342
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,740
And I could get the money back before shooting.

343
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,800
I had no idea the company could collapse.

344
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,240
Later, they asked me to get Screenwriter Confirmation Letter
from Qiao Yi.

345
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
I asked Lucy to get it.

346
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,000
How about this?

347
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,040
I'll turn in every penny I received.

348
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,090
You all can act like you don't know about this.

349
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,540
We can, but the police won't allow it.

350
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,120
We should let the police handle this.

351
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,780
Hold on.

352
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,940
Xiao Jiang. You just said you wouldn't call the police.

353
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,940
What did I just say?

354
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,440
You said we would handle it ourselves, instead of calling the police.

355
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
My dad suggested we keep it from the police.

356
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,900
But that doesn't mean he won't call the police.

357
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,460
You...

358
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,820
President Chen.

359
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,320
What a hero you are.

360
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm not a hero.

361
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,280
I just don't want you, a taekwondo pro,

362
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,280
to break his ribs if he actually goes near you.

363
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,940
In that case, we can't explain ourselves to the police.

364
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,780
You are right.

365
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,960
Smart.

366
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,800
Good move.

367
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,840

368
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,400
 Today, the police uncovered a consumer-related case

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,300
 of Extreme Impala company bankruptcy.

370
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
 They have arrested all the relevant personnel,

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,180
 including two Xing Yi employees.

372
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,520
 Jiang Hanyi, the president of Xing Yi Media, also made a special statement.

373
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,800
 First of all, I would like to offer my deep apology

374
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
 to all victims of this incident.

375
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,460
 Although this incident has nothing to do with Xing Yi,

376
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,460
 we do have to do better at supervising our employees.

377
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,800
 We are partly responsible.

378
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,680
President Chen just got arrested, and President Jiang was already making the statement.

379
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,400
It's clearly planned in advance.

380
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,060
Zhou Tian, you discovered the project proposal.

381
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
How could President Ji not tell you about this?

382
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,680
It's pretty obvious. President Ji and President Jiang didn't want her to know in the first place.

383
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,020
I guess I'm not qualified to know.

384
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,680
Zhou Tian,

385
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,780
you came to me that day?

386
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,960
I heard that the producer of the project happened to be filming in the mountains,

387
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,420
so I rushed over there overnight.

388
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,140
When I got there, my cell phone had no signal.

389
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,740
After recording, my phone was dead.

390
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,260
I didn't even get a chance to tell you.

391
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,740
Sorry. Don't be angry with me. I didn't mean to keep it from you.

392
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,080
- He's apologizing. 
 - He's apologizing.

393
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,340
It's all right, President Ji. You don't have to explain to me.

394
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,640
I do.

395
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,220
You being upset is more serious to me than the board of directors and other people.

396
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,760
Dominating.

397
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
So sweet.

398
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,860
Too sweet.

399
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,220
Zhou Tian, I knew you were worried about me.

400
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,860
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have found that proposal.

401
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,700
Now, let's forget about that.

402
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,380
We can get some food later.

403
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,240
What do you want to have?

404
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,580
Guys, you are in the office now. Behave.

405
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,180
I invited shareholders for lunch. You come with me.

406
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,940
When did you invite them? Just now.

407
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,860
This is going to be a good show.

408
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,620
♪ It was raining that day when you held me ♪

409
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,400
♪ A shooting star fell in my heart secretly ♪

410
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,700
♪ It found a place in your eyes ♪

411
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
♪ and witnessed my promise to you ♪

412
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,230
♪ Eventually, it brightened my whole universe ♪

413
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,380
Hi, Zhou Tian.

414
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,100
Zhou Tian. This is the news release for Qiao Yi's book launch.

415
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,660
How is the rehearsal?

416
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,420
It went well. I went there this afternoon. Both of them were in good condition.

417
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,620
We tested everything, including the sound, light, and screen.

418
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,220
They will have the last joint rehearsal tonight.

419
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll go check again later today.

420
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,540
All right.

421
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,240
President Ji is not back yet?

422
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,500
No. Neither President Jiang nor he has come back.

423
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Aren't they going to watch the joint rehearsal?

424
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,980
I'll get going then.

425
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,380

426
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,500
President Jiang.

427
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,620
Go to Ji Chen's place?

428
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320

429
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,980
Ji Chen is not at home. Take a seat.

430
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,540
President Jiang. What do you want?

431
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,480
The concert is about to begin tomorrow. I'm quite busy.

432
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,080
As long as you leave Ji Chen,

433
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,080
I can give you the position of department director.

434
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,760
Ji Chen is not a commodity with negotiated price.

435
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,720
You don't deserve to like him at all.

436
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
I don't? Do you?

437
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,580
Zhou Tian, you're letting Ji Chen dangle.

438
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,980
Playing hard to get is too childish.

439
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,960
If you keep pestering him,

440
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,220
I'll make him unable to take the CEO position back forever.

441
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,520
Is this how you get the person you like?

442
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,420
You are threatening him with his career, one thing that he cares about the most.

443
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,260
No wonder he didn't go to watch the rehearsal of Qiao Yi and Li Ang.

444
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,920
I just want him to see the bigger picture here.

445
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,420
Tell me. What do you want?

446
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,360
I can give you anything as long as you name it.

447
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,740
What do I want?

448
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,420
There are certain things in this world that you can't buy with money.

449
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,380
At least, you can't buy my affection to Ji Chen.

450
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,200
President Jiang. You don't have to threaten me with his career.

451
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,720
No matter what happens, I'll face it with him.

452
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,820
I like him, and he likes me.

453
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,840
Nothing and nobody can break us apart.

454
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,580
What a confession of love.

455
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,020
Ji Chen. Did you hear that?

456
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,760
You...

457
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,020

458
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,900
Now, I declare,

459
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,260
I'm done being the bad guy here.

460
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,280
W-What does that mean?

461
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,840
Please don't be mad.

462
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,320
The reason why I'm back this time

463
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,880
 was to help Ji Chen to pursue you.

464
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,820
 He may seem to be vigorous and resolute.

465
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,900
He has never been in a relationship before. He doesn't know about girls.

466
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,520
That's why I wanted to help him.

467
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,760
 Take a bite yourself.

468
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,880
 You want me to help you with dressing?

469
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,900
So, you were targeting me all along?

470
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,480
And you pretended to sacrifice Ji Chen?

471
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,680
All was but a scam?

472
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,240
It wasn't all a scam.

473
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,520
We had to stabilize President Chen, you know?

474
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,580
Nevertheless, what do you think of our acting skills?

475
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,480
Good.

476
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,800
Great.

477
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,900
So, Ji Chen knew everything?

478
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,000
You two planned all these from the very beginning, didn't you?

479
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,320
Yes, he knew. He liked the plan.

480
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
I...

481
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,860
Zhou Tian, please listen to me.

482
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,920
Jiang Hanyi, stop talking!

483
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,960
Well... She's gone.

484
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
And she seemed mad.

485
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,160
 But now, you have the chance to make her feel better.

486
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,480
Make yourself disappear now!

487
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,760
What's with the attitude?

488
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,900
I did make her confess her love to you.

489
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,540
 I should at least get some credit for that. Don't you think so?

490
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,460
 But I'm done playing here.

491
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,920
You have to take over from here.

492
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,560
You can be the CEO again. Bye.

493
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,740
Perfect.

494
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,880
Hello? The car is here?

495
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,580
Thanks.

496
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,180

497
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,860
Thanks.

498
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,900
Sweetie, I have successfully messed up Ji Chen's relationship.

499
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,680
Now, I can get out of here. See you in 12 hours.

500
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,440
 I'll pick you up.

501
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,700
Thanks.

502
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,920
And we also arranged first-aid personnel and security guards.

503
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,660
Good. Security guards are already in place.

504
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,500
 Okay.

505
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,420
Zhou Tian, can I have a word with you?

506
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,500
Is it about work?

507
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,240
I didn't lie to you. It was all Jiang Hanyi's doing...

508
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,180
President Ji. Li Ang's concert is about to begin.

509
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
And we have a lot to do here.

510
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,360
Are you really gonna make me stand here and listen to your personal matters?

511
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,920
This is very important. If we can't sort this out, we might as well stop the concert.

512
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,080
What?

513
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,480
This concert may mean nothing to you, but it means everything
to Li Ang and me.

514
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,400
Zhou Tian, he deceived you.

515
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,100
You can't forgive him. Otherwise, I'll fire you.

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,040
You need me now? Hello? Yes, I heard you.

517
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,280
Hey, Zhou Tian. Please listen to me.

518
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
- No, this matter—  
 - Attention, everyone.

519
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,820
There are five minutes left before the concert.

520
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,140
The concert will be on in five minutes.

521
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,860
I can think of nothing but work right now.

522
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,960
Sorry. I really can't talk about your personal matters.

523
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,680
Wait, Zhou Tian.

524
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,580
How can I explain myself to her?

525
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,940
By the way, Boss.

526
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,680
I think you do have feelings for Gigi.

527
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,580
Why don't you tell her?

528
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,340
It's not that I don't want to tell her.

529
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,600
I just fear that it may be a misunderstanding.

530
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
What do you mean?

531
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,380
I'm not sure if she likes me for being me or being the champion.

532
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,120
I once met a girl at the training base.

533
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,280
She brought me lunch every day

534
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,800
until I came as the second place

535
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,500
in one competition.

536
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,320
She never showed up again.

537
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,340
She believed that I, as her idol, must win first place every time.

538
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,640
Otherwise, I wouldn't be attractive to her.

539
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,160
The truth is, we can't take the feelings a fan has for her idol seriously.

540
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,060
But Gigi is different.

541
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,280
She's a good girl but not mature enough.

542
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,760
That's why I have to remain rational.

543
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,600
Zhou Tian, I wasn't finished earlier.

544
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,580
President Ji. It's a critical moment for the concert.

545
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,720
Don't you think it's unprofessional

546
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,120
to talk about personal matters now?

547
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,180
I don't care.

548
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,060
Welcome our special guest of the concert, Qiao Yi!

549
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,560
Now, I want to share a few things with you.

550
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,800
If you can't forgive me for now, I'll follow you around until you can.

551
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,560
If you can never forgive me, I'll follow you for the rest of my life.

552
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,840
I'll never let you go.

553
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,540
In the last couple of months,

554
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,860
my life has been like riding a roller coaster.

555
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,500
There were a lot of ups and downs.

556
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,340
So many things happened.

557
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,540
I almost gave up on myself.

558
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,900
Let me go.

559
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,260
But my friends and colleagues were always there for me.

560
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,260
I'd like to thank them for their trust and support.

561
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm grateful that they didn't give up on me.

562
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,000
For starters, I want to thank my best friend, tonight's star,

563
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,980
a man who accompanied me when times were tough

564
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,660
and created that beautiful song,

565
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,460
Li Ang!

566
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:39,920
 Li Ang!

567
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,440
Next, I want to thank my executive talend manager, Zhou Tian.

568
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,420
It was her persistence and effort that made things better every time.

569
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,860
Where are you, Zhou Tian?

570
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,840
Let me see your hands.

571
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,700
President Ji.

572
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:15,600
 Say yes!

573
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,100
Let me go.

574
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,820
 Say yes!

575
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,740
You said it, remember?

576
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,340
It wasn't your idea. You didn't do anything wrong.

577
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,220
It may not be my idea, but it's my fault to distract you.

578
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,920
 Say yes!

579
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,660
Zhou Tian,

580
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,320
I will apologize to you right here in front of everyone here.

581
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,659
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

582
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:50,619
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

587

588
