1
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:13,080

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:21,260

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,830
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,030
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,130
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,030
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,290
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,700

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,900
No idea if he could get the coach's approval to take a half-day off.

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,260
But my experience told me he couldn't.

20
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,520
President Ji, you're so calm.

21
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,280
Have you thought of any plan B?

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,140
Nope.

23
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,820
Why aren't you anxious about that?

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,740
In the worst situation,

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,800
I'll dissolve the Sports Division Department.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,540
President Ji, stop teasing me.

27
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,420
It can't be that easy.

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,600
If so, you wouldn't have come to Brother Hao yourself.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,860
You are a cunning man...

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,820
No, a wise man.

31
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,060
You must have a plan B.

32
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,300
What's this?

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,920

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,800
This is a place where all our trophies are placed.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,340
Let's go have a look.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,760
Welcome to our trophy gallery.

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,760

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,800
Check this out, President Ji.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,320
She's ugly.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Zhang Hao was the winner of the 2017 National College Distance Race Championship.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
He also won the Boston Marathon,

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,160
the Sixth Ronghai Youth Distance Race,

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,340
the Eighth Ronghai 100 Ultra Trail Challenge, and this competition as well.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,600
Zhang Hao won them all.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,060
Now, you see how successful he is.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,160
If it weren't for you,

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,540
I would have thought this is a showroom specially made for Zhang Hao.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,300

49
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,640
President Ji, perhaps we should go back

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
and see what we can do about the NK campaign.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,900
Did you quit the team because of your leg injury?

52
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
What are you doing?

53
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,980
Don't misunderstand us, Senior.

54
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,800
I lost my balance accidentally,

55
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,160
and President Ji tried to help me.

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,280
Senior, what did your coach say?

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,500
I have an idea.

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,160
The subject for the NK campaign is the way to the championship.

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,300
And everything here shows how Zhang Hao has strived to be a champion.

60
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,380
We can combine those honors with the stories behind them,

61
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,600
and serve them as the initial warm-up to the NK ad campaign.

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,420
It will be heart-warming.

63
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,420
That's why you are the boss, President Ji.

64
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,860
What a brilliant idea.

65
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,960
What do you think, Senior?

66
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
About the ad shooting,

67
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,760
I'll check with my coaches and make arrangements in advance.

68
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,660
However, these pictures are not enough.

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,000
I think our Publicity Room has a lot of videos of previous training.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,540
And the Youth Sports Team,

71
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll go call them.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,620
Tian Tian, before my competition,

73
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,720
I'd like to have dinner with you in the Kitties' Fairyland.

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,140
Sure.

75
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,560
Are you saying the coffee shop that was photographed before?

76
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,920
Yes.

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Why do you go there so often?

78
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,880
Senior Zhang Hao owns that coffee shop,

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,860
and he offered me a job there.

80
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,940
Excuse me. I've got to go.

81
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,400

82
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,200
Here is your coffee, and yours.

83
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
Thank you.

84
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,720
You met Zhang Hao?

85
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,060
What did you say to him?

86
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,640
I told him you are impetuous.

87
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,620
You lied to your family, threw away your future, and return home secretly.

88
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,880
You...

89
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,680
I hate you, Ji Chen!

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,920
You can't refute me. So I was right.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes, you are right.

92
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
If I could turn to my family,

93
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,080
I wouldn't have to run away and lead a secret life.

94
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,240
Brother, I'm way over 18 years old now.

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,420
I should get to choose my own future.

96
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,980
How can I watch you choose the wrong path?

97
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,420
Wrong?

98
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,860
If I was wrong, you are to blame.

99
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,120
Since I was a child,

100
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,340
you have controlled everything in my life.

101
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,040
I wasn't allowed to do anything I wanted.

102
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
But I had to do everything you wanted me to do.

103
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
You controlled every aspect of my life,

104
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,460
including relationships, friendship, and college selection.

105
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,260
Everything was under your control.

106
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,420
You know?

107
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,340
I feel you have chained me with an invisible rock.

108
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,580
But now, I want to get rid of it and get away.

109
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,720
If you had a better taste about men,

110
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,360
I wouldn't have to intervene.

111
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,880
As for the college selection,

112
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
I thought you liked music.

113
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,940
That's why I got you into the Juilliard School.

114
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,180
But do you know why I like music?

115
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,200
Because it was the only thing you allowed me to like.

116
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,900
However, since the day when you got me into the Juilliard School,

117
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,880
everything changed.

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
I got unhappy.

119
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,760
So I wanted to do something that could make me happy again.

120
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,300
Now, you screwed it up again.

121
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,400
Nian Nian,

122
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,460
I did come across Zhang Hao, but I didn't mention you.

123
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,480
I sent the message to get you to show up.

124
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Nian Nian, please come home with me.

125
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,340
We can talk at our home, all right?

126
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,920
Brother, I know you had to be responsible

127
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,760
and take care of me since our parents

128
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,200
died from that car accident.

129
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,060
It's just sometimes, you can be pretty overwhelming.

130
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,940
I just can't take it anymore.

131
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,040
I want to live somewhere you can't find me

132
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,460
and have a life of my own.

133
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,340
No, you naughty girl.

134
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,040
You can't always have canned food.

135
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
That guy 1003 has spoiled you.

136
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,180
Now, go ahead and eat.

137
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,720
I want to talk to you.

138
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,080
What? Is this a bad time for you?

139
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,300
 No, it's all right.

140
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,060
 What do you want to talk about?

141
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,640
Qiu Qiu has grown picky about food lately.

142
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,720
She often yearns for meat and canned food.

143
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,000
So, I'm thinking maybe we should make a dietary plan for her.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,400
I'll do it and make sure she eats healthily.

145
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
What do you think?

146
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,140
I like your idea.

147
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,000
I hope she can change.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,380
She's been such a troublemaker.

149
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,460
Compared to kids,

150
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,740
cats are such good companions.

151
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,400
 Your kids made troubles?

152
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,280
It's my younger sister.

153
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,040
Oh, your sister.

154
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,080
If you don't mind,

155
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,700
you can tell me about her.

156
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,540
We've all been teenagers once.

157
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,040
I may help you somehow.

158
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,900
She finally got into her ideal college,

159
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,040
but she chose to do something else,

160
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,560
something of no worth.

161
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,440
She even ran away from home.

162
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,740
You two had different opinions.

163
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,040
I had the same problem before.

164
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
The difference is that my parents, though unhappy with my life choices,

165
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,780
respected my decision.

166
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,280
My dad said young people would never learn if they don't face the grim reality.

167
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,300
He hoped that I could face the reality

168
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,020
and work my way up to something great.

169
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,120
It would be fine if I couldn't achieve anything.

170
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,240
He would take me in and welcome me back.

171
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,060
Your dad sounds wise.

172
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,880
Indeed.

173
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,860
If my parents continued to oppose me,

174
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,260
I might have to run away as well.

175
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,840
Teenagers can be quite rebellious.

176
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,900
She will do anything that you forbid her to do.

177
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,660
You might as well let her.

178
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,740
If she can't make it work,

179
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,540
she will come back herself.

180
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,060
But if she makes it work,

181
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,180
it's a win-win situation for you both.

182
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Dad, did you find what I asked for?

183
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,500
 Don't you think you should at least say hello

184
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,700
 and ask how I'm doing first?

185
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,240
 I feel hurt to hear you ask about your things right away.

186
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,460
I assume mom left you for the square dance.

187
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,480
She got my approval.

188
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,420
Oh, really?

189
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,060
I can't believe mom went without you.

190
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,380
I couldn't be home for you.

191
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,720
She should take the responsibility of keeping you company

192
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,600
and comforting you.

193
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,300
She can't just go out without you.

194
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,520
 You do know me, my daughter.

195
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,940
- Are you feeling better now? 
 -  Yes, better.

196
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,760
Can you help me find what I need?

197
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,100
 The videotapes and the CDs are all here.

198
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,300
 Can you see them?

199
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,840
 They are right here.

200
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,700
 I'll send them to you.

201
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
All right! Thanks, Dad.

202
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,580
Tian Tian, I'm curious.

203
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,940
Why, all of a sudden, do you need the training videotapes of Zhang Hao and you?

204
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,960
 Do you need it for the wedding?

205
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,440
What? No, of course not.

206
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,640
I need it for work.

207
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,400
 All right, sure, for work.

208
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,540
 I'll express them to you tomorrow morning.

209
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,560
I can't believe you said that.

210
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,320

211
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,240

212
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,900
I'll respect every choice you make.

213
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,860
I won't try to control your life.

214
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,020
But you have to prove you can be responsible for yourself.

215
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,160
To live free from me,

216
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,220
you have to be financially independent first.

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,740
So simple?

218
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,720
We'll have to see later.

219
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,920
Do you think I can't live without you?

220
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,860
All right, I take back the credit card then.

221
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,680
No strings attached?

222
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,400
You've made it clear yesterday that I should have been a better brother to you.

223
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,520
I must take it as a lesson.

224
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,220
That sounds about right.

225
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,380
You just said you wanted me to be free.

226
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,800
I don't want to befriend you on WeChat.

227
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,440
Why not? It's only WeChat.

228
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,820
Still no.

229
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,160
It's a matter of principle.

230
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,840
You have to respect me,

231
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,780
and I'll befriend you when I know you mean what you said.

232
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
Fine, I'll wait.

233
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh, my goodness.

234
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,040
It's President Ji.

235
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,040
What?

236
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,440
I thought he didn't like small shops.

237
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Perhaps Xiao Hei and other cats changed his mind.

238
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,820
Zhou Tian didn't know you are my brother.

239
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,920
You can't tell her, either.

240
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,160
Is there something wrong with our relationship?

241
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes, quite wrong.

242
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,620
Fine, whatever.

243
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,720
If you tell her,

244
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,460
I'll tell her every embarrassing moment of yours, starting from your childhood.

245
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,960
I also have pictures of you in the shower. You will be a disgrace in Xing Yi.

246
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,940
Oh, she's coming. Behave.

247
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,040
Tian Tian, morning.

248
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
Morning.

249
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,120
Good morning, President Ji.

250
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,220
You know each other?

251
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,860
No.

252
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,740
Sir. Thank you for choosing our shop and becoming a member.

253
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,420
That would be 10,000 yuan.

254
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,720
Thanks.

255
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,860
Tian Tian, your usual?

256
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,040
Yeah.

257
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,540
Make me two sandwiches too.

258
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,000
No problem.

259
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,740
President Ji, I wasn't expecting to see you here.

260
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,340
You mentioned it's Zhang Hao's shop. I thought I could give it a try.

261
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,760
Have you finished your work? You look free.

262
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,620
I asked team members, went to the archive,

263
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,420
and went through videos and pictures my dad collected.

264
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,020
And I managed to find all the video materials about Brother Hao.

265
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll have someone make a video clip out of them.

266
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,340
You keep an eye on it as well.

267
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,600
You know this field better than anyone else.

268
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,360
Well... President Ji,

269
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,360
if you have an employee who has found important video materials

270
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,540
and can help edit them,

271
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,280
would you consider giving her resignation letter back?

272
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm not sure.

273
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,480
But I'll fire her if she can't get the video clip done.

274
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,260
Tian Tian!

275
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,220
Good morning, President Ji.

276
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,040
President Ji, here is our contract with NK.

277
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,140
The director of the Sports Division has been fired, and we've already issued a job posting.

278
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,840
President Ji.

279
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,380
Zhou Tian is the talent manager's assistant in the Literature Division.

280
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,740
What is she doing in the NK project?

281
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,620
Do you know how to build a trans-department team by flexible cooperation?

282
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,420
I...

283
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,460
Zhou Tian is passionate, capable, and resourceful. Why don't we use her?

284
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
Right.

285
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,460
Inform the HR Department that I will give Zhou Tian a three-month job transfer training.

286
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,740
President Ji, you are planning to transfer her to the Sports Division.

287
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,700
Why are you so happy about it?

288
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,600
I'm happy for Zhou Tian.

289
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,960
She's been working so hard, and her efforts are finally paid off.

290
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
Qiu Qiu.

291
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,280
Look what I got for you.

292
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,900
What's this?

293
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,460
 Do you like my candies?

294
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,100
I don't eat candies.

295
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,360
You don't like them?

296
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,660
I've never tasted them.

297
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,580
Well, have a try.

298
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Recently, to avoid being targeted by the crocodile, I worked extremely hard.

299
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,480
And now I'm exhausted.

300
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,020
Only candies can make me feel better.

301
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,960
 It sounds hard to tame crocodiles in your zoo.

302
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,520
Forget about that.

303
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
You should have a taste of my candies.

304
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,940
At least try one and then judge for yourself.

305
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,360
And it's my favorite flavor, mint flavor.

306
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,680
 I bought those candies at a shop called Mimi Faso.

307
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,940
It's located on Mingzhi Road.

308
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,160
Brother Zhang Hao, what's so funny?

309
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,450
Tian Tian went to collect materials from our Youth Sports School,

310
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,160
and here is what she sent me.

311
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
Is that Tian Tian?

312
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,640
Right. Isn't she lovely?

313
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,000
Brother Zhang Hao, you like Tian Tian, right?

314
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,860
Senior! Gigi.

315
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,700
Tian Tian, why are you in a hurry?

316
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,740
I have to.

317
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,180
I know you'll be on a plane tomorrow.

318
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,640
I have to bring you the contract before you leave for the competition.

319
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,420
Check it yourself.

320
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,820
You've read it for me, right?

321
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,220
Still, you should read it yourself.

322
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,360

323
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,800
I trust you.

324
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,360
We should celebrate it.

325
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,880
All right.

326
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,440
Your chef is getting better.

327
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,740
Senior, I think you may consider expanding your business.

328
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,800
This coffee shop shall sell not only desserts and coffee but also western food.

329
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,760
Really?

330
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,020
- Here. Have a taste. 
 - All right.

331
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,020
This mushroom soup is amazing!

332
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,380
You're right.

333
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,120
Right?

334
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,120
Look how messy you got.

335
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,160
It's so good.

336
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,480
Have a bite of the corn.

337
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,240
Corn.

338
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,720
You got a great chef there.

339
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,600
 I bought those candies
at a shop called Mimi Faso.

340
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,960
 It's located on Mingzhi Road.

341
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,720
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

342
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,800
Sir, how can I help you?

343
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,020
Hi, I'll have five hundred grams of mint candies.

344
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,060
Sure. Wait a moment, please.

345
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,600
All right.

346
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,520
Sunday?

347
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,080
No, I'm Saturday.

348
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,980
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

349
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,860
No. I'm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Every Day if you like.

350
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,180
Do you like Morning or Evening?

351
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,340
- I'm so sorry. 
 - If you like it, I can change my name to Sunday.

352
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,400
Your birthday is coming up next week.

353
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,420
What do you want as a present?

354
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,880
You already gave me one.

355
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,700
The contract.

356
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,800
That's not a present.

357
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,540
I know you are not a fan of business cooperation.

358
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,120
You wouldn't have said yes to Xing Yi so quickly if it weren't for me.

359
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,940
Senior. Thank you.

360
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,900
Tian Tian. I did sign the contract with Xing Yi, but it wasn't only because of you.

361
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,040
Xing Yi Media is a reliable company.

362
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,780
It's better than any other company that had contacted me.

363
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,940
So, you don't have to overthink it.

364
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,920
In that case, that is a relielf.

365
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,940
Now, what do you want as a present?

366
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,560
If you don't tell me, I'll have to give anything I deem good, and I'm a typical man.

367
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Senior. You really don't have to.

368
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,180
Every year you would give me a present, and every year I would pretend to like it.

369
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,780
It's really tiring.

370
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,700
So, you pretended every year?

371
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,660
Pretended... Every year...

372
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,000
- How could you...
- Please, stop it, Senior.

373
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,080
Enjoy the competition.

374
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,560
I'll get going.

375
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,480
 I'll give you a surprise for this year's birthday.

376
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,720
 Zhou Tian, you made great progress in splits today.

377
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,100
 You were almost there.

378
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,000
 That's because you gave me ice cream.

379
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,780
 Does it mean I can't have the treat when I make it in splits?

380
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,040
 I promise you as long as you keep up the good work,

381
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,520
 I'll buy you an ice cream cake after I win the competition and get the prize money.

382
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,420
 Really? Here, have a bite.

383
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,540
I see. It's a habit formed in her childhood.

384
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,540
That's my girl.

385
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,260
You finally changed your eating habit.

386
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,560
When I got off work today, I went past Mimi Faso, and I saw someone buying mint candies.

387
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,780
I thought she was you.

388
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,120
That's impossible.

389
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,380
I had to work overtime today.

390
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,860
Did that crocodile torture you again?

391
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,100
Not really.

392
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,000
A crocodile will always be a crocodile.

393
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,660
About that girl, was she pretty?

394
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,420
You hate that crocodile so much.

395
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,380
Why don't you find another job?

396
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,280
But I want to make my way in the zoo.

397
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,620
Don't change the subject.

398
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,400
That girl, she must be really beautiful.

399
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,080
That's why you hit on her.

400
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,400
If she was you, I might talk with her some more.

401
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,140
But she wasn't, which makes her a plain stranger to me.

402
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
I'm a plain girl myself.

403
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,320
You may not recognize me out there in the street.

404
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,400
People have their own merits.

405
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,760
Appearance is nothing in comparison.

406
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,520
That's pure chicken soup for the soul.

407
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,560
Have you seen the picture I sent you?

408
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,060
Qiu Qiu finished all her food.

409
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,360
It seems our dietary plan is working.

410
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,700
You mustn't get cocky. Keep up the good work.

411
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,880
You sound like a big boss.

412
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,140
Is this how you talk to your sister at home?

413
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,600
What? Do I sound obnoxious?

414
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,260
No.

415
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,680
You just sound like an old-timer.

416
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,700
You should try to be vigorous. We are all young.

417
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,360
By the way, I have to thank you.

418
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,980
After we talked last time, I approached my sister, and we talked.

419
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,060
It turns out that communication really is the best way to settle things.

420
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,400
That's a perfunctory way to thank me.

421
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,820
You could treat me to a meal.

422
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,420
I was kidding.

423
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,160
All right, let's do it.

424
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,460
Let's meet at 12 noon on Saturday. I'll let you know the restaurant when I confirm it.

425
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,500
You don't have to. I didn't mean it.

426
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,540
It's just lunch.

427
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,240
Let's see if I can recognize you among all those strangers.

428
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,820

429
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,820

430
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,980

431
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,020
It's Saturday. Can you please let me sleep in a little?

432
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,480
I won't cut down on your dried fish.

433
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780

434
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,140
Qiu Qiu.

435
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,300
You were reminding me of the lunch with your dad, weren't you?

436
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,600
Dad?

437
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,860
Where did that come from?

438
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,620
But he could be your dad, right?

439
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,960
I mean, you like him, and I like you,

440
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,640
which means, he may like me as well.

441
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,800
 See you at noon. Keep in touch.

442
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,700
 All right.

443
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,700

444
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,320

445
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,740
 Dear user, this is your voice assistant, Universe.

446
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,120
 Your heart rate is increasing unusually, but other indexes are good.

447
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,900
 According to my intelligent analysis, it's not pathological.

448
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,040
 Your heart racing is caused by nervousness.

449
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,420
 Therefore, I won't give you any feedback data to Kevin, your emergency contact.

450
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,080
Why would I be nervous?

451
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,440
 You know why.

452
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,780
I...

453
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,160

454
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,420
- Welcome, Miss. 
 - Table for two.

455
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,020
This way,

456
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,160
please.

457
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,060
Qiu Qiu, come on out.

458
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,120
Qiu Qiu.

459
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,920

460
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,040
Thank you, Granny.

461
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,640
 - This voice... Zhou Tian!  
 - You're welcome. Is this your cat?

462
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,400
Yes.

463
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,600
It's so cute. What's its name?

464
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,360
Qiu Qiu.

465
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,160
 Qiu Qiu. Zhou Tian.

466
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,420
 Come on, Qiu Qiu.

467
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,160
 Let's go.

468
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:27,940

♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

494
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:46,013
♫  I’ve spent my entire life finding you  ♫

00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:50,359
♫  I’ve never been in love this deep before  ♫

00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,985
♫  Loving you made me become a better me  ♫

497
00:40:54,985 --> 00:41:04,989
♫  I’ll be a shooting star and shine for you forever  ♫

498
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:19,289
♫  Shine for you  ♫
