00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,730

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,980

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,330
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,030
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,330
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,330
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,690
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:18,990
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,390
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,800
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,100
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,540

18
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,120
See? What did I say?

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,960
They are just brother and sister, and that's all.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
It's nothing.

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,520
The wind blows from them to us.

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,460
We can hear what they say. But they can't hear us.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,240
Thank you for everything you have done for me.

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,060
Didn't you say you came to witness

25
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,520
the critical moment of your idol?

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,440
Why are you more relieved after he was rejected.

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,520
I feel relieved for you.

28
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,180
Without Zhang Hao, that competitive love rival,

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,540
you have a slightly higher likelihood of pursuing Tian.

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,460
I'm warning you.

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,720
You can't fall in love with Zhang Hao.

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,500
Why? He's not a bad person.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,620
He's too nice, and a ladies' man.

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,540
You'll be disappointed.

35
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,880
♫  I've never thought I'd be so moved  ♫

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,400
♫  Our first encounter in the crowd  ♫

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,880
♫  In my eyes,  ♫

38
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,220
♫  you're different from the entire planet  ♫

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,420
Why did I feel so bad at that moment?

40
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,180
♫  I want to be more than just your friend  ♫

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,900
Could it be I really fell in love with Brother Zhang Hao?

42
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,440
♫  I just want to take you away  ♫

43
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,520
♫  You light me up with your clear eyes  ♫

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:38,360
♫  You've saved me from being lost and I'm no longer hesitating  ♫

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,600
♫  May you be strong and kind forever  ♫

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,160
♫  May you fly to wherever you want to go  ♫

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,980
♫  You are the warmest ocean waves guiding me  ♫

48
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,360
♫  to ride the winds and sail the waves  ♫

49
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,940
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

50
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,300
♫  You are the light of my heart  ♫

51
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,220
Do I?

52
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,400
I guess so.

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,400
♫  I want to be more than just your friend  ♫

54
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,620
♫  Without any reason, I just want to take you away  ♫

55
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,600
♫  You light me up with your clear eyes  ♫

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,340
♫  You save me from being lost and I'm no longer hesitating  ♫

57
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,480
♫  May you be strong and kind forever  ♫

58
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,140
♫  May you fly to wherever you want to go  ♫

59
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,960
♫  You are the warmest ocean waves guiding me  ♫

60
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,440
♫  to ride the winds and sail the waves  ♫

61
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,680
♫  Wherever you are, you are the light of my heart  ♫

62
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,460
You're still up? What's the matter?

63
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,320
There's one thing I'd love to pick your brain.

64
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,960
May I?

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,620
Go ahead.

66
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,900
If,

67
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,860
by mere presumption,

68
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,460
you were rebuffed in your confession to a girl,

69
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,140
would you do anything dangerous?

70
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,440
How could it be possible?

71
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,440
My confession would definitely be a success.

72
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,940
Your tone suddenly reminded me of a person.

73
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,380
I mean, before the confession,

74
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,280
you have to make clear the attitude of the other party.

75
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,140
A leap in the dark is not sensible.

76
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,020
May I ask how many girls have you ever confessed to?

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,380
I haven't yet met the one I want to pursue.

78
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,100
So it was just your idea on the paper.

79
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,880
Let me guess.

80
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,640
Someone confessed to you today, and you refused him, right?

81
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,340
Actually, I'm upset.

82
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,900
 After all, I have looked to him as a brother since I was a child.

83
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,720
 I don't want to disappoint him or even hurt him.

84
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,060
 But I have no choice.

85
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Set your mind free.

86
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,820
I think you made a good decision.

87
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,900
You know,

88
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,960
a decisive refusal makes your relationship simpler.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
You make it clear to him,

90
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,860
and you won't feel embarrassed.

91
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,780
This is a mark of value and respect for his affection for you.

92
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,900
Thank you.

93
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,140
To be honest with you, I have been a bit uneasy.

94
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,460
But hearing what you said,

95
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,800
I know I did the right thing.

96
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,760
Qiu Qiu,

97
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm back.

98
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,720
That little brat

99
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,000
must have sneaked into 1003.

100
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,100
 Hello, Master. I'm Universe.

101
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,640
 Your heart rate is 76 bpm.

102
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,020
 Your blood pressure is 73mmHg diastolic pressure,

103
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,320
 121mmHg systolic pressure.

104
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,880
 Oxygen intake is 97%.

105
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,100
 Your comprehensive health index is A-.

106
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,840
 Congratulations! Your health condition after the business trip still stays good.

107
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,320
 You received a WeChat message
from Sunday.

108
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,840
Sunday!

109
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,000
Is Qiu Qiu at your house?

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,660
It doesn't come back to wait for me.

111
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,980
Keeper No. 2, you must have spoiled her.

112
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Qiu Qiu is a good girl.

113
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,120
During your absence these days, she suffered a loss of appetite because she missed you much.

114
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,440
I'll show you the video if you don't believe it.

115
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,220
She must know you are coming back,

116
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,360
and that's why she regained her appetite.

117
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
Forget it. The ungrateful kid.

118
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,380
Get her to me tomorrow.

119
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,660
I don't have the energy to take care of her now.

120
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,860
I have to wash up and sleep.

121
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,440
There's no telling how that crocodile will squeeze me tomorrow.

122
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
Squeeze?

123
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,340
Does the work make you feel this tough?

124
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,460
Not that tough.

125
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,880
Just some daily complaint.

126
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
I can bear the pressure.

127
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,420
I have learned a lot during this time.

128
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,240
And I got maturer.

129
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,500
I enjoy the feeling of having new challenges

130
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,080
and new things waiting for me to explore every day.

131
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,900
It, on the contrary, makes me feel more secure.

132
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,560
I haven't had such a full schedule since I left the sports team.

133
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,180
Going to go to bed now. Good night, bye.

134
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,220
Have I been

135
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,200
really so ruthless to her?

136
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,440
Didn't you hear what she said?

137
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,480
She enjoys new challenges every day,

138
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,800
which makes her feel secure.

139
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,980
 But I have grown up.

140
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,680
 I'm no longer the little girl

141
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
 you took under your wings.

142
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,480
 I could face the ups and downs myself,

143
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
 and pursue a better me.

144
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,160
 However,

145
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,820
 you still treat me like a child.

146
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,940
 I know, it's a type of care for me,

147
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,600
 just like the care between siblings.

148
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,940
 So my feelings for you

149
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,900
 cannot be called love.

150
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,600
See?

151
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,280
She doesn't like growing up in the greenhouse.

152
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
She enjoys getting strong in the storm.

153
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,700
Therefore, make her experience the violent storm,

154
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,480
and enable her a fast growth.

155
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,740
Right. Just do it.

156
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,740
Get ready for a new round of challenges.

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,360
Hi, Kevin.

158
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,400
There will be an important job change.

159
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,140
Please deal with it.

160
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,980
Morning.

161
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,240
Auntie, where are my belongings?

162
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,340
President Ji asked someone to clear them away this morning.

163
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,960
Clear away?

164
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,760
W-What does that mean?

165
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,860
I have got no idea.

166
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,380
Based on my past experiences, you might be fired.

167
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,560
Fire?

168
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,460
 No wonder I felt that he became more humane in the training center.

169
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,420
 So he wanted to settle the score with me after returning.

170
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,640
Stop being in a daze.

171
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
Your department is holding a temporary conference.

172
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,060
Everyone is in the meeting room.

173
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,000
Why don't you request your leader to let you stay?

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,660
Make a request?

175
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,980
I'll protest against him!

176
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,760
The labor law protects me, anyway.

177
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,260
Zhou Tian, you came just in time.

178
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm going to announce an important change of personnel.

179
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,140
Have a seat.

180
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,400
President Ji, can you tell me why?

181
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,680
Because you deserve it.

182
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
I didn't expect President Ji would be so mean to your employee.

183
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,300
It's a kind of push and higher demand on you.

184
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,040
I don't think you fit into the present position anymore.

185
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,000
So I announce,

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,380
from today on, Zhou Tian is promoted as—

187
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,020
You have gone too far! Why?

188
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
Promoted?

189
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,660
I said you deserved this.

190
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,900
Work hard in the new position.

191
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,940
You'll be grateful to me in the future.

192
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,880
Thank you, President Ji.

193
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,360
Thank you for all your care.

194
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,900
All right, meeting dismissed.

195
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,320
- Keep it up. 
 - Xiao Tian was promoted.

196
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,980
That's great. I'm leaving.

197
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Congratulations, Zhou Tian.

198
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Good for you, Xiao Tian.

199
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
Xiao Tian.

200
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,060
Xia,

201
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,540
slap me to wake me up.

202
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,440
I came to get my phone.

203
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
It's true.

204
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,300
- You got promoted. 
 - That's true, right?

205
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,760
It seems that their friendship was defeated by jealousy.

206
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,220
How much bonus would you get through the project?

207
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm not sure.

208
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,180
Zhou Tian, since you gained a promotion,

209
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,960
how do you want to celebrate it?

210
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,580
Well, let's have a meal together. My treat.

211
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,600
Great! I'll get everyone informed.

212
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,700
Congratulations!

213
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,560
Share some tips with me on how you made it so fast.

214
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,020
Did you give away yourself,

215
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,760
or did you draw Kevin over to your side?

216
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,420
Stop gossiping.

217
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,360
Can't I get it through my own strength?

218
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,780
How could I draw Kevin over to my side? He...

219
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,160
What are you talking about me?

220
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,300
Director Kevin, are you also here to congratulate Zhou Tian on her promotion?

221
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,540
Director Kevin is such a nice person.

222
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,120
Just send me a red envelope as a gift.

223
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,980
Red envelope?

224
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,980
I have a bigger surprise for you.

225
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,000
President Ji has just said

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,340
this is not the area where the executive talent manager works.

227
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,600
You should switch to your seat now.

228
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Switch my seat? Where am I supposed to go?

229
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
At the door of the CEO's office.

230
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,380
Isn't it your position?

231
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,460
You are unreliable, so you need President Ji's close up instruction.

232
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,660
I'm the backbone of the company,

233
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,120
so I'm assigned to take the lead in the office.

234
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,900
Hurry up.

235
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,800
D-Director Kevin.

236
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,100
Oh my goodness!

237
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,440
What darn good luck you have to sit so close to President Ji?

238
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,780
You could enter his office at any time you please.

239
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,620
Don't forget to pull the curtain down.

240
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,600
What the hell is on your mind?

241
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,480
Good luck?

242
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,880
You should say what evil thing I did to pay the price.

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,600
Go ask everyone else.

244
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,660
Who wants to sit right in the face of the boss?

245
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,100
- Kevin does. 
 - Kevin is an exception.

246
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,840
He's President Ji's henchman.

247
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,120
The thing is definitely not as simple as it looks.

248
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,240
How could Ji Chen, that scheming guy,

249
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,260
arrange his henchman around the people?

250
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Do you mean...

251
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,320
Ji Chen asked Kevin to watch us.

252
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,720
Zhou Tian, you are so scary.

253
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,020
You got promoted

254
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,700
but leave a timebomb around us.

255
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,160
Did I owe you much in my last life to have such a friend like you?

256
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Come on. Drop the act.

257
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,680
It's not that serious.

258
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,040
No.

259
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,120
I bet it's not that simple.

260
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,780
Kevin, please come to my office.

261
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,340
- Chen Can. 
 - Here.

262
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,200
Come here.

263
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,800
Stand up, please.

264
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,440
Stand up.

265
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,460
W-Would you mind standing aside?

266
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,760
You can go.

267
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,440
Director Kevin, what are you...

268
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,760
The geomancy works better this way.

269
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,940
Didn't you also set the table the same way before?

270
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,000
Your eight characters are not well-matched.

271
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
A slight adjustment of the position makes sure the geomancy works well.

272
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,080
 What's the stupid crocodile planning to do?

273
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,960
My waist...

274
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,460
You want me to face the glass

275
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,780
and turn my back on everyone else?

276
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,980
You want to torture me, right?

277
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,840
It brings you good fortune in this way.

278
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,240
 No wonder he wanted me to face him.

279
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,700
 It seems that he wants to watch me doing work.

280
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,740
 Judging from her reaction,

281
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,600
 she should have felt my encouraging eyes on her.

282
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,140
 I do have a feeling that someone is staring at me.

283
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,500
 What does he mean?

284
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,660
 Is this some role-playing of an invigilator and an examinee?

285
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,700
 Perfect.

286
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,860
 I still have the feeling of being stared at.

287
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
 What a perv!

288
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,340
President Ji, it's not that convenient

289
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,240
to have coffee and deal with the work in this position.

290
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,100
I suggest that you should return to your luxurious table.

291
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,620
You'll be more productive in that way.

292
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,960
Don't get me wrong.

293
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,680
I only want to stay away from the computer,

294
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,140
relieve my mood, and sort out my thoughts.

295
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,320
President Ji, I'm now the executive talent manager.

296
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,180
My wage, bonus, and even well-being will increase, right?

297
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,840
But all this morning,

298
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,920
apart from moving here and adjusting the table,

299
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,700
all I have done was to lighten the mood with my boss.

300
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,360
Don't you think it's a loss for the company?

301
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,840
I surely know that.

302
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
So, since we returned from the training center,

303
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,700
I have understood that you need to accomplish the new challenge in a new position,

304
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,520
so that you could become an elite employee.

305
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,680
Jot down what I'm going to say next.

306
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,660
These are your job placement since you became the executive talent manager.

307
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,400
At 9:30 a.m., you should learn the plans of the Publicity Department,

308
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,940
and work with them to complete the publicity program of Qiao Yi's new book.

309
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,380
Have a meeting with the Marketing Department to confirm the design of the book's belly band.

310
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,120
Besides, sort out the data of novels of a total of 2GB by 50 authors in Department Ⅱ.

311
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
And you need to pick some video clips from the eight-hour footage

312
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,500
and make them into a new promotional video.

313
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,180
Kevin's seat is far from my office,

314
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,220
so you should undertake a part of work as my assistant.

315
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
I have a video meeting with the headquarters at 1 p.m.

316
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,200
Collect the process of the meeting for me before 10 a.m.

317
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,580
The quarterly performance appraisal meeting will be held soon.

318
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,980
Verify the completion of each department's performance, and tabulate them for me.

319
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,460
President Ji, can you please repeat them?

320
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,360
Some of them...

321
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,840
No need. I have sent them to your Enterprise WeChat.

322
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,660
 Then why did you ask me to jot them down just now?

323
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,520
 You did it on purpose!

324
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Is it clear enough to you?

325
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,860
Y-Yes.

326
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
Thank you, President Ji.

327
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,620
It's very clear.

328
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,780
I have received it.

329
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,120
I'll do my best to complete the tasks this month.

330
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,820
These are tasks for this week.

331
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,720
But it's Thursday today.

332
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,040
I trust you.

333
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,760
Pressures drive you to grow faster.

334
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,300
You'll be grateful for me someday.

335
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,220
Thanks, President Ji.

336
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,000
 I really appreciate you.

337
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
 You stupid crocodile.

338
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,860
Xiao Xia, how about we go to this restaurant to celebrate Zhou Tian's promotion?

339
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,820
I think...

340
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,180
I...

341
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,900
Chen Can, I think I have an illusion.

342
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,620
I saw a dim figure haunt and disappear again and again.

343
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,540
I think,

344
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,620
here, drink some coffee and calm yourself down.

345
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
Zhou Tian?

346
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,080
So fast.

347
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,820
- Take your time. 
 - Take your time.

348
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,640
She left?

349
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,120
Zhou Tian works like a dog in recent days.

350
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,400
Will this weekend's get-together be called off?

351
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
It's hard to say.

352
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,580
People in our industry are on 24/7 standby.

353
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,520
The director of the Marketing Department divorced two years ago.

354
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,940
I heard it was because she didn't take a day off for entire two years.

355
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't you know her gossip?

356
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,220
Tell me about it.

357
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,420
She was seeing a man in her department.

358
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,240
Really?

359
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,060
Can't believe she got time for a relationship from her hectic schedule.

360
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,840
Not necessary.

361
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,300
You know what? Since she got divorced, she has worked overtime every day.

362
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,700
So they keep each other company,

363
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,260
have takeout in the office together, and work overtime together.

364
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,320
Gradually, they fell in love.

365
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,960
That makes sense.

366
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,100
The greatest opportunity for us desk jockeys to have a relationship

367
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,440
takes place in the work area.

368
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,900
At how many dawns and in the cab on the homeward way

369
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,680
romantic relations have secretly germinated.

370
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,480
- P-President Ji. 
 - President Ji.

371
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,800
- We are returning to work.
 - President Ji.

372
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,700
It's all right. This is lunchtime. Sit down.

373
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,180
I heard you guys say working overtime together grows the seed of love.

374
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,940
What's going on?

375
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,680
We were just kidding.

376
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,020
Yes. We were kidding, President Ji.

377
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,240
I saw you were talking vividly and included the details.

378
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm interested in that.

379
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,560
Actually, we are not very clear about that.

380
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,500
I just know that they often worked overtime until midnight.

381
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,400
Only they were left in the office.

382
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,860
And then, the man bought coffee and chocolate for that woman.

383
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,240
The next day, they took the cab together...

384
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,220
President Ji, this is the publicity program of Qiao Yi's new book.

385
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,060
These are the completed performance of each department signed by each department's director.

386
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,700
These are the cash flow forecast for next season.

387
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,440
And, the flow of activities, the route, the content of speeches, and the lists of dishes

388
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,480
of all the clients you have made a reservation with.

389
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,080
Please check them.

390
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,000
Go get the file of the publicity program from the Marketing Department.

391
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,640
It was delivered to your mailbox five minutes ago.

392
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,820
Get the advertising schedule on official accounts from the Media Department.

393
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,140
In your mailbox.

394
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,740
Three minutes ago.

395
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,780
Get me a coffee at the café downstairs.

396
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,480
Arabica cold brew coffee. No room, no sugar.

397
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,100
Proper temperature. Please enjoy it, President Ji.

398
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,880
If there's nothing else I could do for you, I'll excuse myself.

399
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,400
I finally finished everything.

400
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,840
Finished?

401
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
In your dream!

402
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,020
President Ji said Qiao Yi's fans have been leaving comments on his studio's official Weibo account.

403
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,480
You need to sort them out.

404
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,340
Those that were made three months ago could be excluded.

405
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,800
Read all these in recent three months.

406
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,240
Collect everything related to endorsement, or complains,

407
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,380
and send the e-mail to the relevant departments.

408
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,940
But...

409
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,760
he didn't tell me that just now.

410
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
Three months.

411
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,160
How many comments do I have to read?

412
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,480
Even if I don't blink my eyes

413
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,940
and read until midnight, I don't think I can finish it.

414
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,020
Come in.

415
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,880
 I knew it.

416
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,940
 He is deliberately torturing me.

417
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,220
President Ji, I have some thoughts, but I don't know if I should say.

418
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,640
You shouldn't,

419
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,580
but I know what you want to say.

420
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,540
I have thought about it.

421
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,880
There are hundreds of thousands of comments in recent three months.

422
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,060
It's indeed a bit inhumane to ask you to finish it within a day.

423
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,280
It seems that President Ji is thoughtful to your employee.

424
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,300
Read one week's comments every day.

425
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,680
Working overtime four or five hours a day.

426
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,600
Keep it for a week, and they could be all finished.

427
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,660
What?

428
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,080
Any problems?

429
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,920
If you are good with it, start it now.

430
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,880
No.

431
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,900
I promise to finish it on time.

432
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,520
This is no big deal.

433
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,200
President Ji was crueler to me back then.

434
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,020
Was I?

435
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,160
No, no, no.

436
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,760
You were pushing me forward.

437
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,160
Besides, order two M9 steaks for me.

438
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,240
Ask the chef to cook them in the company at 8:30 p.m.

439
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,180
But I don't remember you have work tonight on your schedule.

440
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,800
Why do you...

441
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,960
You need me to explain it to you?

442
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
It seems that I haven't pushed you far enough.

443
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,200
I guarantee you a satisfactory dinner.

444
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,060
Working overtime together grows the seed of love.

445
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,800
Good idea.

446
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,040
Xin Xin, look.

447
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,660
Brother Zhang Hao is not himself, right?

448
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,640
You know it better than me.

449
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,520
He's heartbroken.

450
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,760
He didn't really date Tian Tian.

451
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,640
He was just rejected.

452
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,240
When I was abroad,

453
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,100
it's a common thing for everyone.

454
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,440
No one takes it—

455
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,600
Brother Hao is different from those men abroad.

456
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,400
He has never been romantically involved.

457
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,140
If we want to cheer him up,

458
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,520
I think we have to get him a strong dose medication.

459
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,320
A strong dose?

460
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
- You mean... 
 - Yep!

461
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,220
Yes, exactly what you are thinking.

462
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,500
Xin Xin, you are reliable at this critical moment.

463
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,960
What works to take the pressure off him?

464
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,500

465
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,780
A strong dose.

466
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,420
A strong dose.

467
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,580
 Gigi is such a sensible girl.

468
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,840
 Brother Hao is supposed to open his heart

469
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,680
 and get himself more choices.

470
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,820
I can get some dates for him.

471
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,140

472
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,060

473
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,220
Chen Can, why hasn't President Ji gotten off work?

474
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,840
No one dares to leave before President Ji leaves.

475
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,140
Well, everyone is still here.

476
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,600
Just be patient.

477
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,640
Are we going to order some food?

478
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,660
Yes, sure.

479
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,900
- You do it.  
 - Me again?

480
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,480
Stingy guy!

481
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,060
It's so late.

482
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,080
Why are they still here?

483
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,420
Fine, I'll order. What do you want to have?

484
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,260
What the hell is it now?

485
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,400
No one gets off work.

486
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,120
- Is there anything wrong? 
 - Nothing is wrong.

487
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,280
Nothing is wrong.

488
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,640
Then why is everyone still staying here?

489
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,660
Who dares to leave before President Ji.

490
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,100
But he didn't inform us to work overtime tonight.

491
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,300
Who knows.

492
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,960
We are going to order some food. What do you want to have?

493
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,340
Nothing.

494
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,620
I'm too exhausted to eat anything.

495
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,120
If you don't have any work to do, just go home.

496
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,600
Don't you know that? When President Ji was still at the headquarter,

497
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,460
he asked all the staff to work overtime once there was something wrong with a case.

498
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,220
But an employee left in advance,

499
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,720
and he was fired the next day.

500
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,240
He is...

501
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,020
Xiao Li,

502
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,400
still deliver packages at this late hour?

503
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
Yes.

504
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,780
See? He's a deliveryman now.

505
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,200
I don't think it's necessary.

506
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,020
It's inefficient.

507
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,980
What Zhou Tian said is right.

508
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,760
Overtime on purpose is not a good thing.

509
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,040
Xiao Xia, if you have finished your work,

510
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,140
go home and take a good break.

511
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,360
It makes you more productive tomorrow.

512
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,880
Okay, President Ji. I see.

513
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,440
Did you hear that?

514
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,760
It's a trap.

515
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,820
He smiled and said "you could go home",

516
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,740
but if we really leave, tomorrow...

517
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,440
What are you waiting for? Time to get off work.

518
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,540
Rest assured, President Ji. We won't get off.

519
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,500
It's all right. You may continue tomorrow.

520
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,960
No! The company is my home.

521
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,640
You have to have a work-life balance.

522
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,920
Working is the best relaxation for me.

523
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Thank you for your loyalty to Xing Yi.

524
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,980
But it's time to leave work now. Everyone should go home.

525
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,760
Make sure all of you leave the company before 8:30 p.m.

526
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,020
Understood, President Ji.

527
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,240
None of us will leave before 8:30 p.m.

528
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,940
- Wait. 
 - Then I'm leaving.

529
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,620
I'll read those comments at home.

530
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
I promise it won't be delayed.

531
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,160
- No! 
 - Hold on!

532
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,300
You can't leave.

533
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,520
See? I told you!

534
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,300
President Ji, what do you mean?

535
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,560
You said we could leave, but why did you change your mind?

536
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,600
We are starving.

537
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,200
Could it be you'll treat us to dinner?

538
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,500
I mean...

539
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,440
President Ji, here are your steaks.

540
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,660
President Ji will treat us to steaks.

541
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,040
President Ji will treat us to steaks.

542
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,660
What Zhou Tian said is right.

543
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,220
I...

544
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,000
I know you have been working hard overtime.

545
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,980
I know I was kind of strict with you,

546
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,060
but I'm still considerate.

547
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,220
So I ordered the prime steaks for you.

548
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,600
I... I'll cut them for you in person.

549
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,960
Good.

550
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,060
How cool President Ji is!

551
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:08,220

552
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,740
Here, Chen Can.

553
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,640
Thank you, President Ji.

554
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,200
 You are considerate?

555
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
 I don't buy it at all.

556
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,140
 You cut each of us such a small piece.

557
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,680
 It's hard to know what the taste is.

558
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,620

559
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,560
All the bungee jumping spots nearby are fully booked.

560
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,160
What can I do?

561
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,568
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

562
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:48,528
♫  A shooting star fell in my heart secretly  ♫

563
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:53,128
♫  It found a place in your eyes and witnessed my promise to you  ♫

564
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:58,998
♫  Eventually, it brightened my whole universe  ♫

00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:03,658
♫  Finally, you've came into my life  ♫

566
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:07,121
♫  After all is said and done, we’ve missed out so much  ♫

567
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:11,958
♫  We tried so hard to engrave each other’s face  ♫

568
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,968
♫  I’ve made up my mind to drift with you all my life  ♫

569
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:21,998
♫  But you remained calm and silent  ♫

570
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:25,498
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

571
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:30,198
♫  Don’t worry, I decided to be your support  ♫

572
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:35,463
♫  I’ll make the future ahead more promising  ♫
