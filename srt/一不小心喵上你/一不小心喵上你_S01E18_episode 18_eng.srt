1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,930

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,080

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,590
♫  I'm thinking of you again somehow  ♫

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,130
♫  The happiness and sorrows keep replaying in my mind  ♫

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,330
♫  I thought I could love you until eternity  ♫

6
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,030
♫  I have never stopped missing you  ♫

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,130
♫  I can’t stop missing your tenderness  ♫

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,030
♫  I’ll always be waiting  ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
♫  For no reason at all  ♫

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,090
♫  I only want us to be together  ♫

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,490
♫  I’ll be there waiting for you  ♫

13
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,700
♫  For the rest of my life  ♫

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  All I need is you  ♫

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  I’m always missing you  ♫

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,820

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,720

18
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,880
Wow, you're impressive.

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,690
I didn't expect you to ruin this place.

20
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,040
Did you throw a bomb here?

21
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,010
I can't be the only one to blame.

22
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,450
You played a part too.

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,190
You are to blame as well.

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm here to help only because you are emotionally incapable and slow.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,050
No, that's inaccurate.

26
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,140
- You are downright stupid. 
 - You...

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,780
All right, fine. I know what you want to say.

28
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,450
Just keep that sarcastic remarks to yourself,

29
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,560
and think about what to do next.

30
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,600
Since she said that we can only talk about work in working hours,

31
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,250
perhaps I can make use of non-working hours.

32
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,130
Good.

33
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,300
You are finally getting smarter.

34
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,910
Morning, President Ji.

35
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,880
I'll drive myself today.

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,960
That's very nice of you.

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,700
I said I'll drive myself today.

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,180
Oh, I see.

39
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,350
Luckily, I am a quick thinker.

40
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,020
I... I left my phone in your car.

41
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,270
Wait, President Ji. I left my phone.

42
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,530
Morning.

43
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,530
- Why are you here? 
 - It was on the way, so I'm here to give you a ride to work.

44
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,220
Thanks, but no. You are the boss.

45
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,190
How can I let you drive me?

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,100
Just consider it a benefit of being my employee.

47
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,600
I suppose you will pick up Xiao Xia,

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,980
Chen Can, and other people as well.

49
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,130
Is your car big enough for us all?

50
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,840
Please get in the car, Zhou Tian.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,940
I have something to tell you.

52
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,320
All right.

53
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,980

54
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,520
 President Ji. Wait!

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,460
President Ji. Here is your schedule for today.

57
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,180
President Ji?

58
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,340
Kevin. Sit.

59
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,360
Sit here.

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,440
How do you think of employee benefits in our company?

61
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,520
They are good enough to be almost an example in this industry.

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,420
You think?

63
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,710
Well,

64
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,710
we do need to work on one thing to improve.

65
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,840
Great.

66
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,560
Tell me that.

67
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,110
Well, President Ji. I am perfectly satisfied.

68
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,890
But again, I can't look far from where I stand,

69
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,980
and see the whole picture as you see it, President Ji.

70
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,180
If you think there is anything we should work on, please tell me.

71
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,960
I'll go to the administrative department and get it done right now.

72
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,660
I think...

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,920
We can have an early shuttle bus.

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,650
Shuttle bus?

75
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,080
Our company is in the downtown area.

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,710
There are plenty of buses and subways nearby. It's quite convenient.

77
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,120
I don't think a shuttle bus is necessary.

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
I'll get to it.

79
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,560
Hey, Zhou Tian.

80
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,650
Did you hear the news?

81
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,230
There is an early shuttle bus for us,

82
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,640
and it will pass by your place.

83
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,690
You're up.

84
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,120
Sorry that I fell asleep.

85
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,230
I have to go through the discharge formalities for you.

86
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,840
No hurry.

87
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,540
You just woke up. You can get to it later.

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,220
What?

89
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,920
Is there something wrong with my outfit?

90
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,740
No.

91
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,520
You look good in it.

92
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
You think?

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,340
If you like it, I'll wear it more often.

94
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,690
By the way, Brother Zhang Hao.

95
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,550
Do you want to resume our agreement?

96
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,900
Agreement?

97
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,680
What are you talking about?

98
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,110
Our 10-day agreement.

99
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,090
It's the tenth day today.

100
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,720
Do you want to get back to the forest?

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm ready.

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,270
I promise that you will experience something different every day even if you continue for another 100 days.

103
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,370
No, thank you.

104
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,420
I have been thinking a lot during the last ten days.

105
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,700
I can't handle the forest.

106
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,980
I just need one tree.

107
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,760
Well, did you find the tree you like?

108
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,300
Not yet.

109
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,820
Is this our shuttle bus?

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,800
President Ji is here?

111
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,670
What are you waiting for? Get on here.

112
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,890
Come on, quick.

113
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,820
Go sit there.

114
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,260
Morning, President Ji.

115
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,460
Hurry. Sit.

116
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,730
- Morning, President Ji.  
 - Morning to you too. Come in and sit.

117
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,720
- Good morning, Director Kevin. 
 - Morning, come on and sit.

118
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,750
Morning, President Ji.

119
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,940
Morning, Director Kevin.

120
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,080
Morning, Xiao Can.

121
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,900
Hurry.

122
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,340
- Can I sit here? 
 - Get lost.

123
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,610
It's for Zhou Tian.

124
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,370
Let's go to the next station!

125
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,520
What is President Ji doing here?

126
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,690
I have no idea.

127
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,980
But he's already on the bus when we got on at the first station.

128
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,520
That's weird. President Ji lives at least dozens of kilometers from your station.

129
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,910
Why would he make such a detour?

130
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,260
Because of Zhou Tian.

131
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,170
President Ji. Next station is the Third Xinxiu Village.

132
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,160
Did you prepare what I asked?

133
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,370
Director Kevin, what is this?

134
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,750
This is from President Ji.

135
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,880
He doesn't want you guys to get bored on the way to work.

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,860
These teddy bears will accompany you.

137
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,290
No need to put one here.

138
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,120
This seat is for Zhou Tian.

139
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,540
For Zhou Tian?

140
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,240
- What is this about? 
 - No idea.

141
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,340
President Ji. All done.

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Come on and sit, Zhou Tian.

143
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,870
It's such a beautiful day.

144
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,090
Why waste it on the bus?

145
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,590
I'll run to work.

146
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,810
Turn, now.

147
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,380

148
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,900
Why does President Ji not take the bus today?

149
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,780
We ordinary people will never know what President Ji thinks.

150
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,920
Morning.

151
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,650
Morning, President Ji.

152
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,140
What are you doing?

153
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,650
I thought I could run to work to beat the traffic.

154
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,050
You want to join me?

155
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,310
Sure.

156
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,630
Zhou...

157
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,810
But I don't feel like running today.

158
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,070
I'll ride to work.

159
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,480
I...

160
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,390
President Ji, you can't ride a bike, can you?

161
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,240
I suggest you learn it.

162
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,560

163
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,380
Hey, wait!

164
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,500
Wait for me, Zhou Tian.

165
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,920
 Is that President Ji? Why is he in sportswear?

166
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,380
He looks good even in that sportswear!

167
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,400
Look how energetic he is.

168
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,810
Wait for me, Zhou Tian.

169
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,370
Is President Ji chasing Zhou Tian?

170
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,720
Yes, he is.

171
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,340
 He's literally chasing her.

172
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,280
Slowly.

173
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,670
I can't believe Zhou Tian could be so cruel.

174
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,380
You were actually running, for her sake.

175
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,980
I have been working for you for years, and I never saw you running before.

176
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,310
Still, she ignores you.

177
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,500
Can you ride a bike?

178
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,880
Bike?

179
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,620

180
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,160
Hurry.

181
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,650
I'm so exhausted.

182
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,790
President Ji. I told the authorities to make this spot a no-parking zone for sharing bikes.

183
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,010
I can't believe I had to do all that.

184
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,860
Well done.

185
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,680
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

186
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
Looking for bikes?

187
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,560
It's a shame only one tandem bike is left.

188
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,850
Don't worry, we can share it.

189
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,170
No, thanks. President Ji.

190
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,460
I'll take the shuttle bus today.

191
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,000
Xiao Xia brought me breakfast.

192
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,020
Keep it up.

193
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,460
What!

194
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,270
Come on, let's go.

195
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,610
I-I will ride?

196
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,260
Hurry.

197
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,850
Careful, President Ji.

198
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,940
Is President Ji thinking of becoming a sports man?

199
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,140
He's been exercising two days in a row.

200
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,170
So charming!

201
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,560
Whatever, don't you see that Director Kevin is riding the bike?

202
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,140
President Ji doesn't even try once.

203
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,870
But President Ji keeps glancing at us.

204
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,030
Who is he looking at?

205
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,970
Who else could it be?

206
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,250
 Why is he doing this? So annoying.

207
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,260
 Does he have to make everyone know about us?

208
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,790
President Ji is hit by a car!

209
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:05,520
Qiu Qiu, do you know that President Ji was hit by a car?

210
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,920
Although it was only a tricycle carrying soy sauce,

211
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,500
and he didn't get hurt, I feel like it was my fault.

212
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,290
I shouldn't have been stubborn.

213
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,760
Tell me. Does he really like me and want to pursue me?

214
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,060
I mean, it's so obvious, right?

215
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,820
Qiu Qiu, how about this?

216
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,550
You will meow twice if you think so, and once if you don't.

217
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,020
Qiu Qiu, do you think he likes me and wants to pursue me?

218
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,410
This doesn't count. Let's try again.

219
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,630
I know. Even you agree with me.

220
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,500
But, his intention is so obvious.

221
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,020
What am I going to do?

222
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,030
 What is going on?

223
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,140
 A new girl.

224
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,130
 That's what I'm talking about.

225
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,560
Take a bite yourself.

226
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,640
 Allow me.

227
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,330
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

228
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,600
I wanted to give you a surprise.

229
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,880
Since you have already got breakfast,

230
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,850
I'll have these myself.

231
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,820
 He's got breakfast and company.

232
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,020
 I can't believe I brought jujube porridge to him.

233
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,140
 Zhou Tian, why did you do that?

234
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,740
 No, what he did doesn't concern me.

235
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,880
 I have nothing to be upset about.

236
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,940
 I'm not upset, no.

237
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,070
Qiu Qiu, I'm not upset, right?

238
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,620
You are the best.

239
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,920
 Tell me. Is President Ji really pursuing Zhou Tian?

240
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,620
Stop that. You don't know it.

241
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,100
Well, I think...

242
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,150
No, I can't stand it anymore. I have to go ask her.

243
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,770
Colleauge Zhou Tian, tell me the truth.

244
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,850
Is President Ji pursuing you?

245
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,350
W-What are you talking about?

246
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,770
Do you have a hangover?

247
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,780
Don't talk nonsense.

248
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,620
No, Zhou Tian. You hesitated.

249
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,580
I know it's not that simple.

250
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,900
Zhou Tian. The sago cycas that never blooms is now blooming for you.

251
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,570
And the ten-thousand-year-old iceberg is melting because of you.

252
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,530
This is a chance of a lifetime for you.

253
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,830
What a load of crap. Get lost...

254
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,530
- How could you say that? 
 - You don't have to be shy about it.

255
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,020
Leave me alone.

256
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,160
Wow, look at her.

257
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,480
She is so gorgeous.

258
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,660
Morning, President Ji.

259
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,130
Good morning, Director Kevin.

260
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,430
Who is she?

261
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,680
She is Jiang Hanyi, her father is the president of the An Sheng Group.

262
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,970
She's here to inspect our work.

263
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,700
Well, I should go.

264
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,230
Well, is this Director Jiang the fiancée of President Ji that people talk about?

265
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,380

266
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,890
Let me introduce her to you.

267
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,130
She is from An Sheng Group...

268
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm one of you. No need to be so formal.

269
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,930
Hello, I'm Jiang Hanyi.

270
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,960
I only came back recently to help our president with some business.

271
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,200
I heard that according to KPI, Xing Yi had beaten the target in this quarter.

272
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,480
I was hoping to learn something from you guys.

273
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,230
You must be Zhou Tian.

274
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,230
President Ji told me that most achievements of the company were from Qiao Yi and his commercials.

275
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,530
And you played a vital role.

276
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,170
Not really.

277
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,340
We all worked hard.

278
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,070
I'm the least experienced member in our team.

279
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,120
It's good to be humble.

280
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,150
But this is business, and results matter here.

281
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,170
I hope you can all show the real you here.

282
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,590
You can show what you got, may it be about work or personal feelings.

283
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,980
You don't have to hide.

284
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,950
Right, Zhou Tian?

285
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,790
President Ji. Director Jiang. Do you want coffee?

286
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,850
Give me my usual.

287
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,020
And bring Director Jiang a cup of hot latte.

288
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,530
Make sure it's dark roasted Mandheling, semi-sweet and with almond milk.

289
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,670
Does anyone else need coffee?

290
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,490
Zhou Tian, do you want one?

291
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,070
What kind of coffee do you want?

292
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,680
 What do I want?

293
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,640
 You are asking me now.

294
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,420
 How did you know what she likes without asking.

295
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,080
No, thank you.

296
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,710
Well, I won't have coffee either.

297
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,080
Just bring one for Director Jiang.

298
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,570
All right.

299
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,070
All right. Without further ado, let's begin our weekly meeting.

300
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,760
I'll start with the agency business.

301
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,510
Speaking of the agency business of Xing Yi this week,

302
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,030
we must go through the performing section first.

303
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,320
This is Xing Yi's last quarter...

304
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,370
What? Why is there a blank space?

305
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,600
 You are the boss. How could you not know?

306
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,830
 This blank space is so obvious.

307
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,380
 And there is no document for our meeting.

308
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,820
That was a mistake.

309
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,460
I'll make sure everything is okay upon meeting.

310
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,880
It's all right. I'll do it myself.

311
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,330
It seems that "Silent Cry" will be released soon.

312
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,460

313
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,730
We have been communicatingwith the producer about the publicity program.

314
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,810
 What I'm saying is that you can take your parents to watch it.

315
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,180
 You will see your name at the end of the film.

316
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,530
 Why would there be my name?

317
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,460
 The producer will put on all names of major creators there.

318
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,010
Please pass my coat on to me.

319
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,260

320
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,180
I have plans for tonight. So, I can't have dinner with you.

321
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,830
Is this about work?

322
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,650
I'll ask Kevin to drive you.

323
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,280
No, thanks. I'll be with several ladies.

324
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,360
Is it because you are worried that something may happen to a delicate girl like me?

325
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,930
I'm not worried about you.

326
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,250
I just don't trust those girls who you hang out with.

327
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,880
What!

328
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,810
I'm out of here. Don't miss me. Bye.

329
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,250
Zhou Tian. There is a new restaurant downstairs. Let's go—

330
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm not feeling well. So, no.

331
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,500
Are you sick?

332
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,370
No.

333
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,490
I'm perfectly well.

334
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,040
Aren't you worried that something may happen to a delicate girl like me?

335
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,720
President Ji, you are engaged now.

336
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,850
Please behave appropriately in front of your female subordinates.

337
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,510
Engaged?

338
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,460
You can't possibly buy those rumors.

339
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,070
I grew up with Jiang Hanyi.

340
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,000
But you'll know her if you give her a chance.

341
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,930
She likes girls. She'll never like me.

342
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,130
President Ji. Don't worry.

343
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,340
Neither was I mad at you nor did I misunderstand you.

344
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,780
Excuse me. If you are not here to talk about work, I'll go to the bathroom.

345
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,600
Thank you.

346
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,800
 Is she jealous?

347
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,490
 She's so sharp-tongued, but soft-hearted.

348
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,600
 I like it.

349
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,330
President Ji hasn't left yet.

350
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm tired. I don't want to work overtime.

351
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,180
President Ji.

352
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,720
It just turned 6:00 p.m. I can't believe President Ji has left already.

353
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,850
Mind your own business.

354
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,010
Our boss is gone. We should go as well.

355
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,370
They are so fast.

356
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,220

357
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,280
What a coincidence. I don't want to work overtime today, either.

358
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,900
Since you didn't eat lunch. How about...

359
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,950
Perhaps we can have dinner now.

360
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,860
You want my company only when Jiang Hanyi left you.

361
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,200
What did you say?

362
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,720
I said I have seen enough of you today at work.

363
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,670
Please leave me alone.

364
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,460
It's non-working hours now. I don't want to see you.

365
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,960
- Wait... Zhou... 
  - Stop right there.

366
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,320
Finally, you are back.

367
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,060
I had a terrible time.

368
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,770
I sneaked out early to come back and keep you company.

369
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,990
Don't speak to me like that.

370
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,100
This is exactly what I wanted to talk about.

371
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,930
We are close friends, and I didn't think it was a big deal

372
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,980
for you to stay with me when you come back.

373
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,590
But you have got to behave in front of my employees.

374
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,670
I begin to think you have caused a misunderstanding between Zhou Tian and me.

375
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,420
Misunderstanding?

376
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,890
That's a good thing.

377
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,180
You are a stubborn man, and you finally find someone you like.

378
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,220
You are so close to winning her over.

379
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,640
I must stay and help you. Otherwise, I would have gone long ago.

380
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,460
You know I'm about to get married next month.

381
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,730
I didn't ask for your help.

382
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,940
You may make things worse.

383
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,360
That's impossible. You should give me some credit.

384
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,820
As a woman, I know what a woman thinks and likes.

385
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,960
The moment when I saw your Zhou Tian, I knew how to win her over.

386
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,380
Don't you think she looks lovely and cute

387
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,500
when she gets upset.

388
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,560
Come to think of it,

389
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,510
she is kind of cute.

390
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,220
I'm warning you.

391
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,640
Don't try to hit on her.

392
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,340
No worries. I'm on your side.

393
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,420
Unless,

394
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,280
you want to make a move to me.

395
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,380
I'd rather hit on a guy than you.

396
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,390
Anyway, you don't have to worry about me.

397
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,920
If you have nothing to do,

398
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,770
you can go check on Nian Nian.

399
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,000
You can ask what her plans are.

400
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,360
When will she finish her degree?

401
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,640
She can't work in that coffee shop forever.

402
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,840
All right. Got it.

403
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,700
Well, I'll go sleep now. Good night.

404
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,110
How could I not think for you?

405
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,280
 Let me adjust that tie for you.

406
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,610
 Who is she?

407
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,470
 She's Jiang Hanyi.

408
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,680
 Her father is the president of the An Sheng Group.

409
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,420
 Is this Director Jiang the fiancée of President Jiang

410
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,050
 that people talk about?

411
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,990
 Give my money back. You fraud.

412
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,080
 Give my money back.

413
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,120
 You fraud. Give my money back.

414
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,500
- What's going on here? 
 - No idea.

415
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,350
They are already when we arrive.

416
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,680
With so many people blocking the door, we can't even get in.

417
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,330
- We should call the police. 
 - Yes, good idea.

418
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,220
- Let me call the police. 
 - You want to call the police?

419
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,570
We are the victims here.

420
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,310
Where is Qiao Yi? Get him out.

421
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,290
I paid the full price six months in advance to buy the Extreme Impala. Because it was endorsed by Qiao Yi.

422
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,240
But now, I didn't get my car. And that auto company vanished.

423
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,420
Extreme Impala?

424
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,450
Qiao Yi has never endorsed it.

425
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,690
How about this? I'm Qiao Yi's executive talent manager.

426
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,180
You can tell me what happened exactly.

427
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,530
Do I look like a fool?

428
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,070
You are an executive talent manager. So what? You can't decide anything.

429
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,290
We want to see Qiao Yi.

430
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,070
 - We want Qiao Yi! 
 - We want Qiao Yi!

431
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,660
 - We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

432
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,420
 - We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

433
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm Qiao Yi's talent manager, and I'm the boss here.

434
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,310
You can talk to me.

435
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,920
Here is the fact.

436
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,550
Qiao Yi recommended a new car named Extreme Impala.

437
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,520
As his fans, we trusted him,

438
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,380
and we believed the product he recommended must be good.

439
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,290
That's why we paid the full price six months in advance.

440
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,670
Now, it's time to pick up our cars, but we can't find the dealer.

441
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,320
You said that Qiao Yi endorsed Extreme Impala.

442
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,010
But we just reviewed all the business contracts here,

443
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,830
and there is no contract relating to this auto company.

444
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,620
What do you mean? Are you saying that we are here to find trouble with you?

445
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,790
We saw Qiao Yi's pictures on the website of Extreme Impala,

446
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,340
and there were posters of him in the auto shop.

447
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,060
If he's not paid to endorse that car,

448
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,930
how could his pictures be used there?

449
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,320
Plus, there were pictures of him and the CEO of that company.

450
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,860
That can't be fake. He even wrote a post on Weibo about it.

451
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,020
But we didn't find any endorsement contract.

452
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,450
I think there must be some misunderstanding here.

453
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,210
Everyone, I hope you can go back and wait.

454
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,160
We will get to the bottom of it and get back to you.

455
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,470
No, we won't.

456
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,340
The manufacturing company is gone already.

457
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,880
I can't believe you are still trying to fool us around.

458
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,000
Get Qiao Yi out here. We want to see him.

459
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,820
 - Get him out.
- Get Qiao Yi out.

460
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,730
You leave us no choice but to call the police.

461
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,180
Hanyi.

462
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,520
Please calm down.

463
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,290
This is nothing personal.

464
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,180
We just want the police to help and investigate this issue.

465
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,230
There is so much we need to figure it out.

466
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,320
It's best if we let the police help.

467
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,280
We will get to the bottom of this.

468
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,210
What do you think?

469
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,250
All right.

470
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,740
All right. Kevin, go with them.

471
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,710
Rest assured.

472
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,830
We will give you an explanation.

473
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,630
Please come with me.

474
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,250
- Hanyi, you... 
 - I know.

475
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,450
I have already contacted the legal department of our group.

476
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,190
They will send a lawyer.

477
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,780
And someone is already doing the background check

478
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,960
of the company behind the Extreme Impala.

479
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,580
Zhou Tian, where are you going?

480
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,700
I'll go find Qiao Yi. I'm worried that he might do something when he saw the negative news.

481
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,630
I'll take legal counsel and a lawyer and go with you.

482
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,780
It's pretty clear now.

483
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,380
That company used the publicity photos of Qiao Yi at a cocktail party,

484
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,970
and distorted them into endorsement photos.

485
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,080
I'll ask our firm to prepare an official statement.

486
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,900
But before that, Qiao Yi can't answer any questions from the press.

487
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,180
He's right.

488
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,880
Qiao Yi has an exclusive interview this afternoon.

489
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,420
Zhou Tian. You stay here and help Qiao Yi prepare for it.

490
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,220
Make sure he can handle it.

491
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,430
We will go back and prepare the statement.

492
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,310
All right, President Ji.

493
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,540
Now, now. Don't be upset.

494
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,420
About the interview, I'll talk to the press in advance.

495
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,340
However, some reporters with bad intentions

496
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,160
may ask you about the Extreme Impala.

497
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,500
You can just say

498
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,440
that you have never endorsed Extreme Impala,

499
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,490
and you are a victim as well.

500
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,400
Our company will issue a statement about it.

501
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,890
Come on. Can you repeat what I just told you?

502
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,400
I...

503
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,800
I have never endorsed Extreme Impala,

504
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,900
I...I...

505
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,480
Why is this happening to me!

506
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,220
First, there was that copyright dispute,

507
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,400
and now the Extreme Impala incident.

508
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,720
I have read what people say online.

509
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,830
Many people believed that I endorsed that car.

510
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,480
They paid full price because of me.

511
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,760
It was my fault.

512
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,950
They trusted me so much.

513
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,170
But I can't do anything for them.

514
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,090
Instead, I got them ripped off.

515
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:27,150

516
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,480
Well, you did something, actually.

517
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,640
Do you remember that I logged into your Weibo account

518
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,230
and replied to your fans?

519
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:44,377
♫  It was raining that day when you held me  ♫

520
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:48,337

525

526
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:16,177

527

528
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:25,107
♫  You’re afraid our life would be dull and uncertain  ♫

529
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:30,007
