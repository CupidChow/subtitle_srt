1
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,079
Why are you choosing the harder way?

2
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,390
Doldam Hospital is sought out
by many trauma patients...

3
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,359
and the employees...

4
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,630
are proud of the work they do.

5
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,460
What has that got to do with us?

6
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,700
If we bulldoze out the hospital...

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,500
just to build another one
for the rich,

8
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,299
we will be met...

9
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,840
with internal strife as well as the
backlash from the local community.

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,510
Yes, there will be that at first.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,709
But once we give them
a few benefits,

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,510
the conflicts will subside.

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,150
That is how business is done,
Dr. Park.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,250
If my memory is correct,
your way turned out...

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,420
to be a failure three years ago
and that cost you your job.

16
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,469
Boo Yong Joo...

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,439
isn't an easy opponent.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,939
I know.

19
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm fully aware of
how much he's admired...

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,180
and worshiped at Doldam.

21
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,680
So?

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,849
I'll make the others see the truth.

(The Age of Manipulation)

24
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,590
The Age of Manipulation.

25
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,560
I will show them...

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,599
how opinionated and reckless
Master Kim's beliefs are.

27
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,699
Even one's reasonable beliefs
can be manipulated.

28
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,870
Whatever standards
he believes to be true...

29
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,139
will be painted
as unrealistic and wasteful.

30
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,180
A weird world
where even universal values...

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,909
are manipulated...

32
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,050
into being calculated
as what's right and what's wrong.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,599
Power is misinterpreted
as one's right.

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,629
Those who claim their rights and
interest are equal to justice.

35
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,139
So tell me.

36
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,310
Do you think you can get rid of him
by doing that?

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,879
People have no respect for others.

38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,810
I believe the truth
always holds power.

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,949
I promise I'll prove
that I'm right...

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,590
and that he's wrong.

41
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,699
It has turned into a world
where you need to stomp on others...

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,370
in order to prove that you're right.

43
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,139
Mr. Park, did you know
that President Yeo was resigning?

44
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,340
No, I didn't.

45
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,240
Must we keep it a secret...

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,310
even in this situation?

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,849
You promised me.

48
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,520
Ms. Uhm said that...

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,250
President Yeo resigned
with a single letter left behind.

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,259
Ms. Oh is upset because of it.

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,590
Things have turned out this way,

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,129
and I think there's no point in
hiding the secret.

53
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,969
Maybe it's right
we tell them the truth.

54
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:50,969
Tell us what?

55
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,039
What is this about?

56
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,349
Mr. Park.

What happened to her?

60
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,029
A patient's mother
accidentally hurt her with a knife.

61
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,329
What?

62
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,170
- Call Master Kim right now.
- Okay.

63

1, 2, 3.

64
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,310
Take this away.

65

Eun Jae, stay with me. Hey, Eun Jae!

66
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,810
Give me something I can use
to stop the bleeding.

67
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,279
Here.

68
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,550
I need more gauze.

69
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,250
Get me a D-set and some EB.

70
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,389
- Okay.
- I need a hemostat.

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,399
(Episode 7)

73
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,120
I heard Mr. Yeo...

74
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,689
has stage-four lung cancer.

75
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
When did you find out?

76
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,170
About a month ago.

77
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,470
The sound of his cough
kept bothering me.

78
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,110
So I ran a check on him.

79
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,290
I guess that's why...

80
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,589
he suddenly disappeared
without telling anyone.

81
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,290
He didn't want us to cause a fuss.

82
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,129
Everyone dies.

83
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,529
And he wanted...

84
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,939
to end his life quietly.

85
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,480
You're right.

86

Everyone dies.

87
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,319
But it feels so sudden
and awkward...

88
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,290
to think that President Yeo
will no longer be around.

89
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,970
I want to hear about your plan.

90
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,769
I'm talking about Dr. Park.

91
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,779
The office is bigger than expected.

92
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,509
But I have to say, it's very tacky.

93
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,350
President Yeo was a very simple man.

94
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,190
He kept everything that used to
belong to the former presidents.

95
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,259
Replace everything this weekend
with new furniture.

96
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,789
Especially this desk and chair.

97
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,529
They really don't suit Dr. Park.

98
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,429
You should call him President Park.

99
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,269
Oh, right.

100
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,470
If you tell me
your preferred design,

101
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,740
I'll have everything replaced
right away.

102
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,970
I'll inform you separately.

103
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,750
Can you also get
a new coffee machine?

104
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,710
- Dr. Park...
- President Park.

105
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,850
President Park...

106
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,389
prefers drip coffee.

107
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,220
The coffee machine?

108
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,090
Is there a preferred brand?

109
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll also tell you that later.

110
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,029
Okay.

111
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,259
If you need anything else
other than what you just mentioned,

112
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,600
don't hesitate to let me know.

113
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,230
I'll have everything ready
in no time.

114
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,009
Anyway, I have to say,
I'm very honored and grateful...

115
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,779
that I'm given the opportunity...

116
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,809
to work for such a competent
and amazing...

117
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,549
Please excuse me.

118
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,590
I'm in the president's office.
If it's not urgent...

119
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,059
What? Who got hurt?

120
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,230
Dr. Jung

121
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,529
Eun Jae got injured?

122
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,970
Where? How bad is it?

123
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,370
A patient's mother accidentally
cut her neck with a box cutter.

124
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,139
- What?
- Dr. Seo is giving her stitches.

125
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,009
If the wound was 2mm deeper,
she would've been in big trouble.

126
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,519
Are you sure
you're doing a proper job?

127
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,850
I guess you feel better now.

128
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,360
Maybe I should've asked Master Kim.

129
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
Isn't this part of the body
too sensitive...

130
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,730
for a fellow to stitch up?

131
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Turn your head.

132
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,500
I hope it doesn't scar.

133
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,299
You shouldn't have gotten involved
in the first place.

134
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,669
How could I stay still?
He beat his wife like a sandbag.

135
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,340
It's their family matter.

136
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,679
He committed violence in a hospital.

137
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,779
Do you have some kind of a trauma
regarding domestic violence?

138
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
Turn your head.

139
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,860
I just thought it was right
to fight for the weak.

140
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,730
She's a woman. And imagine
how scared she must be...

141
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,159
to go through something like this
in a foreign country.

142
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,730
That's what you call being nosy.

143
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,669
No, it's called
being able to relate.

144
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,240
You can't just call that being nosy.

145
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,039
The world is already harsh as it is.

146
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,240
We should at least be able
to rely on one another.

147
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,409
You still shouldn't have
gotten hurt!

148
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,879
Master Kim.

149
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,679
Cut.

150
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,250
Cut.

151
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,820
How is she?

152
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,120
There was some bleeding at first,
but fortunately,

153
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,629
it didn't reach any
of her major blood vessels.

154
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,529
And I gave her TD and antibiotics.

155

(TD: Tetanus vaccine, Antibiotics)

156
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,470
Don't worry, Master Kim.
It was just a slight cut.

157
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,440
It wasn't a slight cut.
You had to get seven stitches.

158
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,200
I can do my job just fine.

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,539
It doesn't even hurt that much.

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,539
It'll start to hurt
once the anesthesia wears off.

161
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,480
Prescribe some painkillers.

162
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,539
Okay, sir.

163
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,779
Master Kim! Master Kim!

164
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,590
Dr. Cha, are you okay?

165
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,149
Yes, I'm okay.

166
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm so relieved to hear that.

167
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,990
What's going on?

168
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,559
Can I talk to you in private?

169
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,200
I wonder what's going on.

170
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,740
They're discussing
who's at fault for what happened.

171
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:15,669
Turn around.

172
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,169
What? Oh, okay.

173
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,710
Master Kim!

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,899
What's going on here?

175
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,629
Welcome.

176
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,799
I was just hearing about
the details of the accident.

177
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,210
If you want to hear the details,
do so at the police station.

178
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,110
Why would you do that here?

179
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,179
Someone was injured at our hospital.

180
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,350
Of course, the police
should be involved.

181
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,549
The attacker's husband
keeps saying...

182
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,149
he was wrongfully accused,
Master Kim.

183
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,389
What?

184
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,230
What do you think is so unfair?

185
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,629
That female doctor came at me first.

186
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,100
I was outside the ICU
all night watching my son,

187
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,470
then I took a nap.

188
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,799
That's when the doctor showed up,

189
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,309
screamed at me and pushed me
and told me to get out.

190
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,539
She acted like
she was out of her mind.

191
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,580
She did that when you had done...

192
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,779
absolutely nothing wrong?

193
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,179
What wrong could I do...

194
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,080
when we were here
because of our sick son?

195
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,350
Our child's life was in your hands.

196
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,220
We're the underdog in a hospital.

197
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,889
The doctors have the upper hand.

198
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,159
Listen, mister.

199
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,759
You got abusive...

200
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,600
and your wife
hurt one of our doctors.

201
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,899
Don't ignore the context...

202
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,299
and make yourself look like you're
the underdog at a disadvantage.

203
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,809
What you're doing
is abusing your status.

204
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:56,809
Do you know that?

205
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,009
Did you hear that?

206
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,909
He looks down at me even now!

207
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,210
He was like that
from the moment we arrived!

208
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,110
He mocked me in front of others...

209
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,779
and shooed me out!

210
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,480
Did you?

211
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,690
No one can be physically...

212
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,889
or verbally abusive in the ER,

213
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,529
and when someone breaks that rule,

214
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,830
it's right to shoo them out!

215
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,259
My gosh. This is unbelievable.

216
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,299
Fine. I'm an ignorant fool,
that's all.

217
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,669
My son was at death's door...

218
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,210
and I'm not a good speaker.

219
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,610
It's true that I was agitated.

220
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,909
But it's not right
to call that abusive.

221
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,879
That's just unfair.

222
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,620
Outside the ICU as well.

223
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,919
It was self-defense.

224
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,320
That female doctor attacked me
and my wife got upset.

225
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,289
She was just trying to protect me.

226
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,690
Isn't that why you did that?

227
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,100
You were trying to protect me.

228
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,460
It was a mistake, right?

229
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,769
Ma'am.

230
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,799
Do you agree with
what your husband said?

231
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,320
My gosh. This is so frustrating!

232
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,190
Why wrestle with it?

233
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,830
The security footage will tell all.

234
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,269
Don't you have any cameras?

235
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,600
Well... We do.

236
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,710
But...

237
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,710
Can we check the footage?

238
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Well...

239
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,110
How does this look like
to you, Mr. Lee?

240
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,279
However many times we look,

241
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,519
it looks like Dr. Cha
picked on him first.

242
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,490
Cha Eun Jae.

243
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,120
There's no way out of this.

244
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,259
Oh, dear. What should we do?

245
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,059
I'm fine.

246
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,169
Are you sure you're fine?

247
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes, of course I am.

248
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,539
Don't you worry.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,509
It's just seven stitches.

250
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,610
Have you never
gotten stitches before?

251
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,379
I scared you, didn't I?

252
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,980
The blade just grazed my neck.

253
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,679
Look. Doesn't it look clean?

254
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
It does.

255
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,090
I was scared because I bled so much,

256
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,789
but the wound was just this big.

257
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,620
Don't worry.

258
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,059
I'm really okay.

259
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,230
But it was very close.

260
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,200
It was your neck of all places.

261
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,200
That's true,

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
but don't you think I was lucky?

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,339
The blade missed
major blood vessels by 2mm.

264
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,410
Our job can be so extreme too.

265
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,039
We get cursed out all the time.

266
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,539
Then we get hit...

267
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,779
and sometimes sued.

268
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,549
Now people even wield box cutters.

269
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,319
And it's not like we can
select patients to look after.

270
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,250
The lady did nothing wrong.

271
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,690
It's all the husband's fault.

272
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,960
Are you Doldam's Mother Teresa?

273
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,490
Don't defend them.

274
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,029
I'm not defending them.
I'm defending myself.

275
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,369
I should say it was a pity.

276
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,170
If I say it was dangerous and close,

277
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,140
I'll be too scared to
ever look after a patient again.

278
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,269
Right?

279
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,609
Come on.

280
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,150
I was trying to be funny.
Just laugh.

281
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,779
I'm really fine now. Honestly.

282
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,420
I'm suddenly craving caffeine.

283
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,220
I need a coffee.

284
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,990
My gosh.

285
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,160
She's not okay at all, is she?

286
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,859
She's not. Poor thing.

287
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,609
What can you do about it?

288
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,180
Take off early if it's too much.
Don't overdo it.

289
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,890
No. I'm fine.

290
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,019
Don't pretend to be brave.

291
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,519
What if I don't?

292
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,759
Would I be able to get by?

293
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,259
You were hurt.

294
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:44,930
And you're being threatened.

295
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,059
Why are we skipping to that topic?

296
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,470
You don't want to show
your weaknesses,

297
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,299
and I don't want others to see mine.

298
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,740
If I say it's too much,
people will say I'm weak.

299
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,740
If I say I'm afraid, they'll say
it's because I'm a woman.

300
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,920
If I'm not cool with things,
I'll be treated like a nuisance.

301
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,720
Who'd say that in this situation?

302
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,450
They're the weirdos.

303
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,289
You said that to me first.

304
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,559
You told me not to get involved.

305
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,630
Can't you even tell when
someone is concerned for you?

306
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,299
What's that now?

307
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,529
Is it concern coming from you
and a nuisance coming from me?

308
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,339
Where's the standard?

309
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,609
Where do you draw the line
between nuisance and concern?

310
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,640
Whatever. Let's forget it.

311
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,750
Hey. Take your coffee.

312
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,180
I pressed the wrong button.

313
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,619
You drink it.

314
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:01,269
Hey.

315
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,839
Hey, Dr. Seo.

316
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,940
How are you?

317
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
Why don't you keep your word?

318
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,519
And why don't you answer your phone?

319
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,220
Do you want to die?

320
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,190
Let's talk outside.

321
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,190
I won't let you off anymore.

322
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:22,990
I'll embarrass you real good today.

323
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,170
Ms. Oh.

324
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,339
What are you doing here?

325
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,710
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,349
For not telling you about
President Yeo's condition.

327
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,190
You shouldn't apologize for that.

328
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,190
President Yeo asked you
not to tell...

329
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,759
and you just kept your promise.

330
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,599
Don't apologize to me.

331
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,299
I really didn't think that...

332
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,029
he'd leave us just like that.

333
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,369
He always was...

334
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,609
decisive and never
left things hanging.

335
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,740
Are you all right?

336
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,049
I should become all right.

337
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,490
That's the last mission of sorts...

338
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,720
that President Yeo left.

339
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,089
To be the people of Doldam.

340
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,690
To be ourselves.

341
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,900
I heard Dr. Cha was hurt.
How is she?

342
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,400
Fortunately, the cut wasn't deep.

343
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:41,940
The new president...

344
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,170
is investigating the case in person.

345
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,740
I guess he's all fired up
from day one.

346
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,779
Is there anything else?

347
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,150
No, not so far.

348
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,450
This one? No, I don't think so.

349
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,529
Jessie, what's going on?

350
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,200
Which is the right one?

351
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,970
My gosh.

352
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,099
What's going on?

353
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,609
Why is it so cold?

354
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,509
What are you doing here?

355
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,279
You people don't mind us
and get back to work.

356
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,450
I have business with Seo Woo Jin.

357
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,119
Dr. Seo, do you know this guy?

358
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,230
Why won't you say anything?

359
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,099
You can't exactly say
you don't know me.

360
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,359
Think about all the money
you borrowed from me.

361
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,069
Did he borrow money
from a loan shark?

362
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,000
A loan shark?

363
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,609
I don't know what this is about,
but this is inappropriate.

364
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:51,609
This is a hospital
and a public place.

365
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,440
Please put your shirt back on
and leave...

366
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
before I call the police.

367
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,150
You're a scary one, aren't you?

368
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,980
But no can do, I'm afraid.

369
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,920
In fact,
my pants are coming off next.

370
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,119
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong with him?

371
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,130
Goodness, it's a little chilly.

372
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,529
Listen up!

373
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,930
Because of this jerk right here,

374
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,029
I haven't received my money back.

375
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,299
I don't have money for clothes...

376
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,809
or even meals.

377
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,309
Don't you feel bad for me?

378
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,009
I've been starving all this time.

379
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:32,019
Mr. Koo!

380
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,250
He took the graveyard shift,
so he won't be here.

381
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,289
Then please call the police.

382
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,359
Sure.

383
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,529
Stop this and leave.

384
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,630
Why? Are you embarrassed
now that everyone knows...

385
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,799
you borrowed money
from a loan shark?

386
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,529
If so, then pay back your debt.

387
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,730
I paid 10,000 dollars.

388
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,599
What about the rest?

389
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,500
This won't make money
appear out of nowhere.

390
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,470
Then write a memorandum.

391
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,680
I stripped down to my skivvies,

392
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,849
so I should at least
get something out of it.

393
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,079
I have bosses to face, you know.

394
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:05,049
Bring me the money or a memorandum.

395
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,279
Until then, I'm not going anywhere.

396
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,420
Goodness.

397
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,460
This is nice.

398
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Gosh.

399
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:33,839
What now?

400
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,180
No matter how I look at it,

401
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,009
it seems like
you provoked him first.

402
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,950
That husband has been
beating his wife.

403
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,190
And where in the video shows that?

404
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,000
Where does it show
the husband beating his wife?

405
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,430
It doesn't show here, but...

406
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,299
Then there's no evidence.

407
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,039
Right?

408
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,400
Ask the wife.

409
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,369
I was injured only because...

410
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,039
I was stopping her
from hurting her husband.

411
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,279
If you ask her...

412
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,910
We already did...

413
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,750
and they're saying another story.

414
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,579
What?

415
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,049
She was so surprised
when you launched yourself at him...

416
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,220
that she mindlessly
swung the box cutter...

417
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,259
to defend her husband.

418
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,359
No way.

419
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,630
She was definitely...

420
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,130
What now?

421
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,569
Can you prove it?

422
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,539
Where's the evidence
that backs up your claim?

423
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:42,779
Tell me though.

424
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,720
Why should I prove myself to you?

425
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,049
- What?
- This has nothing to do with you.

426
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,359
The incident happened
within Doldam Hospital,

427
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,859
so it's our issue to solve.

428
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,359
It's also under my purview as well.

429
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:00,359
How so?

430
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,569
Because Dr. Park has been appointed
as the president of Doldam Hospital.

431
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,240
That means I'm automatically
stuck here as well.

432
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,869
What...

433
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,740
Dr. Cha, I'm afraid
the change was made today.

434
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,009
So...

435
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,549
Think wisely about
whose side you choose.

436
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Could you also stop
being so disgusted?

437
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,259
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

438
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,970
Have Dr. Cha apologize.

439
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,539
The hospital will also
pay the hospital bills...

440
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,670
for the kid's surgery
and everything else.

441
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,410
I'd rather we wrap this up quietly.

442
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,410
Our doctor was hurt
within the hospital walls...

443
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,980
and she could've been
severely injured.

444
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,319
Quietly wrap up the incident?

445
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,589
Am I hearing this right?

446
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,319
The security camera footage
confirmed it.

447
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,329
Without probable cause,
Dr. Cha grabbed...

448
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,960
the husband by his collar.

449
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,369
We should check
with Dr. Cha first...

450
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,369
and see if she had
a good enough reason.

451
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,470
It seems like you want
to make this a big deal,

452
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,440
but that will only hurt Dr. Cha.

453
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,339
What?

454
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,180
Dealing with
the uneducated and ignorant...

455
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,380
never ends well.

456
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,079
It will only hurt our reputation.

457
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,549
For this hospital
and also for Dr. Cha,

458
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,359
it's best to sweep this
under the rug.

459
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,259
What if I don't agree to it?

460
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,329
It's simple.

461
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,900
If you won't be the leader
that the GS department needs,

462
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,109
I'll replace you.

463
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,910
So what's your plan?

464
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,549
I'm talking about Dr. Park.

465
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,180
What will you do about him?

466
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,490
Whatever we do, those people...

467
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,559
will continuously make us choose...

468
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,289
between two options.

469
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,200
Which will it be?

470
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,859
Your livelihood...

471
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,069
or your pride?

472
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,599
Which will it be?

473
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,769
Will you make her apologize
and wrap this up quietly?

474
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:25,240
Or will you step down
from your position?

475
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,750
Then...

476
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:33,180
we'll have to do one or the other.

477
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,220
Probably.

478
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,319
Either we'll successfully
persuade them...

479
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,190
or...

480
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,160
watch as Doldam Hospital closes.

481
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,150
Yes, Master Kim.

482
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,450
Is Dr. Cha there?

483
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,450
Yes, she's talking to...

484
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,890
Dr. Yang right now.

485
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,059
He's pressuring her into a decision.

486
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,259
Tell her to wait.

487
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,960
I'm on my way,
so she shouldn't do anything...

488
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,430
until I get there.

489
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,829
She'll stay put.

490
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,970
What's wrong with him?

491
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,369
- Dr. Seo.
- Dr. Seo!

492
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,970
My gosh.

493
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,309
- Get out.
- My back.

494
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,579
This doctor just kicked someone.

495
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,650
Get lost!

496
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,150
Leave.

497
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,619
Did you just hit me?

498
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,220
All right, fine.

499
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,490
Let me take a trip
to one of your hospital rooms...

500
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,920
and make money off a settlement.

501
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,259
Hit me.

502
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,990
Go ahead.

503
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,529
Don't, Dr. Seo.

504
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,700
Let go of me.

505
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,000
Why would you
voluntarily step in dung?

506
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,640
- That's enough.
- Dung?

507
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,109
That's what you called me?

508
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,279
I did.

509
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,319
Your actions stink,
so what else can you be?

510
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,250
Son of a gun.

511
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,920
Dr. Bae!

512
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,089
Are you all right?

513
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,299
Move.

514
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,430
Let go!

515
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,109
Dung?

516
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,509
You jerk!

517
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,549
Stop!

518
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,089
- I can do it myself.
- Hold still.

519
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,630
Why put yourself between them
only to get beaten up?

520
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,529
Why did the bone doctor...

521
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,029
suddenly butt in?

522
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,859
Thanks to him interfering though,

523
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,769
the situation didn't escalate.

524
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,829
My gosh.

525
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,640
Did you save Dr. Seo then?

526
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,940
There's no need to
make it sound so grand.

527
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:12,039
You're awesome, Dr. Bae.

528
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,109
Dr. Yun.

529
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,609
Don't you think you find
too many people to be awesome?

530
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,680
Tell me about it.

531
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,380
So many people here are amazing.

532
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,789
That's why I love this place.

533
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,920
I don't need this,
so get your hands off me.

534
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,630
How does it feel
to be a doctor then?

535
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,299
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

536
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:36,029
This is a hospital, sir.

537
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,740
- Please keep it down.
- Why do you think...

538
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,200
Dr. Seo borrowed money
from a man like that?

539
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,109
He could've gone to a bank.

540
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,710
You know how banks can be.

541
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,779
Forget about it.

542
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,480
They never put umbrellas
over those soaking in the rain.

543
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,319
He needed money,
but he had no one to turn to.

544
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,980
Going to a loan shark
would've been his only option.

545
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,250
I see.

546
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,819
Whatever the story is,

547
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,730
he seems to be
in a nasty situation.

548
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,960
Gosh.

549
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,769
Enough of that.
Call the cops instead.

550
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,470
Once the cops arrive,

551
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,200
I'll tell them about
the money Woo Jin owes me...

552
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,900
and my injuries.

553
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,910
I'll report it all,

554
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,509
so... Gosh, that hurts.

555
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,039
I must have a broken rib too.

556
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,119
Must you...

557
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,690
press charges though?

558
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,450
Yes, of course.

559
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,619
I'm going to see him behind bars.

560
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,559
So be it then.

561
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,930
Mr. Park.

562
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:39,759
Did you call the police?

563
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes, they're probably on their way.

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,069
All right.

565
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,500
Escort them to him right away.

566
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,569
However,

567
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,769
just know that we'll also...

568
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,380
be pressing charges too.

569
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,980
Why? What for?

570
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,750
You punched one of our doctors.

571
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,119
If I recall,
you threw the first punch.

572
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,059
And that's not all.

573
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,990
You marched into our hospital,

574
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,230
hindered our staff,

575
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,529
unlawfully tried to collect
and threatened Dr. Seo.

576
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,500
Also, what gives you the right...

577
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,400
to strip anywhere you please,

578
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,369
especially in a public place?

579
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,349
Look at this worm squirming.

580
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,779
As if. This is a dragon.

581
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,420
Dragon, my foot.

582
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,119
How's that appropriate for
a worthless thug like you?

583
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,289
Unbelievable.

584
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,589
What? Worthless?

585
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,529
Did you just insult me?

586
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,599
Well,

587
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,630
one would need
to be respectful first...

588
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,069
in order to be disrespected.

589
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,140
- What?
- You thugs...

590
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,539
are leeches who lend money
to those desperate...

591
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,410
only to suck the unreasonable
interest out of them.

592
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,710
A leech?

593
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,950
You've got to be kidding me.
Who are you again?

594
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,650
Are you really a doctor?

595
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:09,690
Me?

596
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,090
I'm a doctor to those
who need medical assistance.

597
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,559
But then I transform
into a mad dog...

598
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,860
when facing thugs like you.

599
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,429
I guess I go back and forth.

600
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,969
So only come around again...

601
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,710
when you're sick or injured.

602
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,340
Also,

603
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,079
don't perform a striptease...

604
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,050
because you just feel like it.

605
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,320
Have you no shame?

606
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:52,800
Yes, sir.
There's this insane doctor.

607
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,199
I'll fill you in when I get there.

608
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,440
Woo Jin.

609
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,539
Follow me.

610
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,849
There are two fellow doctors
at Doldam Hospital.

611
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,250
One is being threatened after
borrowing money from a loan shark...

612
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,119
while the other...

613
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,860
is a troublemaker who can't operate
due to her nausea.

614
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:22,460
He's been running this hospital
with two lunatics.

615
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,000
I guess that says a lot
about Master Kim too.

616
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,429
You're right.

617
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,099
How on earth...

618
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,429
was he able to save patients
with the lunatics?

619
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,599
He must be beyond normal.

620
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,039
How about you hire
new fellows first?

621
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,849
The two we have right now
lack in too many ways.

622
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,420
- Seo Woo Jin, was it?
- Yes.

623
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,090
He's the one...

624
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,559
who stabbed Hyun Joon in the back
at Samjin Hospital.

625
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,619
He has decent hands.

626
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,460
Back at Geodae Medical Center,

627
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,099
you fired him yourself.

628
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,369
That's before I saw him operate.

629
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,840
Until we have applicants
who wish to work here,

630
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,699
I'd like to keep him on board.

631
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,710
Surgeons that competent
are rare these days.

632
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,309
If we're getting rid of anyone,
it should be Cha Eun Jae.

633
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,380
Who needs a surgeon...

634
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,320
that can't operate in an OR?

635
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,019
Yes, sir.

636
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,360
Are you nervous, Dr. Yang?

637
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,559
Sorry?

638
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,960
Are you worried that
Dr. Seo might replace you?

639
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,570
As if he'd ever be a match for me.

640
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,369
He's several years my junior,
you know.

641
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,739
It's why I'm telling you to ease up.

642
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:47,579
You seeing him as competition
makes you seem threatened.

643
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,820
How long has he been harassing you?

644
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,489
How much do you owe?

645
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,929
What is it?
Don't you want to tell me?

646
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:11,699
No.

647
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,800
Because of your pride?

648
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,570
I'm not used to this, you know.

649
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,110
I've never talked to people
about my life.

650
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,380
All right.

651
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,989
You can get going.

652
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,090
Just like that?

653
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,460
Yes, just like that.

654
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,530
What else is there?

655
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,099
I thought you'd hold me responsible
for what happened today.

656
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,199
In what way, exactly?

657
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,940
I could get fired for this.

658
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,400
I'm fully prepared for that.

659
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,579
What about the money
you owe me then?

660
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:57,909
You have to pay me back
over the course of 10 months.

661
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,780
Until you do,

662
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,949
you're not leaving this hospital.

663
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,090
Don't you dare.

664
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,230
What now? Do you have more to say?

665
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
Why...

666
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,630
are you being so nice to me?

667
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:19,599
When have I been nice?

668
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,340
All I do is yell at you
and scold you.

669
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,110
That's my point exactly.

670
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,650
Forget about everything else...

671
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,349
and focus on your patients.

672
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,019
That's all I ask.

673
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,739
Master Kim sure is phenomenal.

674
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,610
Isn't that what you said
about Dr. Bae earlier?

675
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,579
You aren't picky at all
when it comes to men.

676
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,719
Gosh, have you already
figured me out?

677
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,960
Well, I fall in love too easily...

678
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,659
and make a habit of unrequited love.

679
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:18,389
I understand how
one can fall in love too easily,

680
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,300
but who makes a habit
of unrequited love?

681
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,199
Can that actually be a habit?

682
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,769
Of course.

683
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,000
I fall in love with someone
without their knowledge,

684
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
flounder around
in my own emotions...

685
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,239
and break it off in my mind.

686
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,469
You have no idea
how cost-effective it is.

687
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,809
No money needs to be spent
and I never get dumped.

688
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,349
Oddly enough, you have a point.

689
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:40,519
So?

690
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,420
Who are you in love with these days?

691
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:45,619
Someone in the hospital?

692
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,489
Gosh, I can't tell you that.

693
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,489
Why not?

694
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,630
Is it because that person...

695
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,460
is here in the ER with us?

696
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,130
What? Who in the ER?

697
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,800
Is it perhaps Dr. Seo?

698
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,510
Is it Dr. Bae then?

699
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,250
Don't tell me it's Mr. Park.

700
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,389
Mr. Park? Of course not.

701
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,219
Why not? What's wrong with Eun Tak?

702
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,920
He's the face
of our nursing department.

703
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,460
Why don't you take some time
to think about it?

704
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,929
I believe that you and him
could have great chemistry.

705
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,059
But Ms. Uhm!

706
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,070
Let's ask him
while we're on the subject.

707
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,670
Mr. Park.

708
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,570
What do you think about Dr. Yun?

709
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,210
You should get back to work.

710
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,909
See? He isn't interested in her.

711
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,150
Chemistry, my foot.
You're being absurd.

712
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,050
You don't even know anything.

713
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,190
Mr. Park.

714
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,230
Are you busy?

715
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,699
Yes. Why?

716
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:04,170
I was wondering how Ms. Oh is doing.

717
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,539
Is she doing okay?

718
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,599
She's doing fine.

719
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm relieved to hear that.
I was worried about her.

720
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,750
Then I'll be off.

721
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,019
Why am I not an option?

722
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,289
What? What do you mean?

723
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,389
You said it's just a hobby.

724
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,159
It doesn't cost you any money,
and you're in no risk to get dumped.

725
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,800
So I don't get why you wouldn't
consider me an option.

726
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,940
Am I that unattractive?

727
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,849
I only said that because
I didn't want to embarrass you.

728
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,719
Ms. Uhm and Ms. Joo were there.

729
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,960
But no one's here right now.

730
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:03,960
Yes.

731
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:06,699
You're right.

732
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:17,940
How about some beer after work?

733
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,440
- Today?
- 7pm at On Your Way.

734
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,210
Sure.

735
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,320
Dr. Cha, where are you going?

736
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,989
I'm on my way to apologize.

737
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,219
But Master Kim gave you orders
not to do anything.

738
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,389
I think I should just apologize...

739
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,260
and settle the mess.

740
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,829
Please let me through.

741
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,300
No, wait.

742
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,170
There's no need.

743
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,340
What are you even going to say?

744
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,469
You were only
trying to help the weak,

745
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,269
and you even got hurt
in the process.

746
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,039
Whatever the case,
I still made things get out of hand.

747
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,880
So what?

748
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,579
You're going to apologize
when you don't even mean it?

749
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,989
Why would you waste your time
and energy on something like that?

750
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,719
Because I don't want things
to get worse.

751
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,329
Hasn't it ever crossed your mind
that the choices you make...

752
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,500
to make yourself feel better
are actually what causes things...

753
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,599
to get worse?

754
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,829
I just feel uncomfortable
that I put the hospital...

755
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,900
in such a troublesome situation.

756
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:55,170
It's better to feel uncomfortable.

757
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,340
Sir.

758
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,809
People get on their knees
to make themselves feel better,

759
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:59,739
apologize to avoid causing problems,

760
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,079
and stay quiet and let people win
thinking it isn't worth the fight.

761
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,679
Listen.

762
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,449
If you make excuses and get used to
doing that kind of stuff,

763
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,349
you'll end up...

764
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:13,190
living a worthless life
and always get pushed around.

765
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,320
Do you understand?

766
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,190
That's a bit far-stretched, sir.

767
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,230
Then...

768
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,139
go ahead and apologize
on your knees.

769
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,969
I guess it's not a bad idea
to learn for yourself.

770
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,449
Master Kim...

771
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,949
is worried about you.

772
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,920
I know he can be a little mean,

773
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,449
but he's pretty much always right.

774
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,750
I just wanted to do a good job.

775
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,289
I'm sorry.

776
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,289
I didn't want to cause trouble.

777
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:30,000
My gosh, what a rude little brat.

778
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,969
And if I could solve things
by putting aside my pride,

779
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,639
I thought I should go ahead
and do so.

780
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:44,480
I thought it was right to stay quiet
and let things slide.

781
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,519
I thought that was the way to go.

782
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,789
But...

783
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,860
why do I feel so uneasy?

784
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,230
Good job.

785
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,300
He's telling me
that I did a good job.

786
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,570
You have a lot more
common sense than I thought.

787
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,039
And it looks like I'm being
acknowledged for my maturity.

788
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,340
But...

789
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:15,239
I heard you're struggling
due to your nausea.

790
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,880
It's gotten a lot better.

791
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,719
After I took the medication
prescribed to me by Master Kim,

792
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:22,920
I successfully handled
two cases of surgery.

793
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,260
When do you plan to get married?

794
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,400
Sorry?

795
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,829
Why do you ask?

796
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,369
I want to know
when you're going to quit.

797
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,500
Why would I quit?

798
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,610
Let's be honest.
Not a lot of female doctors...

799
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,679
last for a long time as surgeons.

800
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,610
They study really hard...

801
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,210
to get a medical license.

802
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:55,880
But after a couple of years
of hard work, they get married.

803
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,090
Once they become good enough,

804
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,719
they suddenly become pregnant
and go on maternity leave.

805
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,530
But why do I constantly feel
so uneasy?

806
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,460
If you leave for a couple of years
to give birth and raise a baby,

807
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,300
who do you think will end up
taking your place?

808
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,539
The doctors who are left behind
will have to do your job.

809
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,269
But don't you think that's unfair?

810
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,809
Sir, I don't...

811
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:24,079
That's why I rarely teach
female doctors.

812
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,050
On top of that,
you get nauseous in the OR.

813
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:30,820
So that's more of a reason
to let you go.

814
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,320
What do are you trying to say?

815
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,630
I'm sure you understood by now.

816
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,340
Get a job at another hospital.

817
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:51,110
But sir...

818
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,840
You should take responsibility
for the trouble you've caused.

819
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,409
That's why I apologized to them.

820
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,179
What about the damage you caused
to the hospital?

821
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,320
Don't you know
that the hospital agreed...

822
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,949
to pay for all the medical expenses?

823
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,019
You made President Park...

824
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:07,320
go through a mess on his first day.

825
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,519
So it's only right
that you take responsibility.

826
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,559
And in that very moment,
I finally learned my lesson.

827
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,159
It's better to feel uncomfortable.

828
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,070
People get on their knees
to make themselves feel better,

829
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,900
apologize to avoid causing problems,

830
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,369
and stay quiet and let people win
thinking it isn't worth the fight.

831
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:22,900
Listen.

832
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:26,639
If you make excuses and get used to
doing that kind of stuff,

833
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,610
you'll end up...

834
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:32,250
living a worthless life
and always get pushed around.

835
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,579
Do you understand?

836
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,590
I'll give you a month.

837
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:39,019
I want you out of here
before the month is over.

838
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:47,900
I let myself stoop so low...

839
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,599
that I had turned into someone
who deserved to be treated that way.

840

(Doldam Hospital, Yeo Woon Young)

841
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,619
It looks like Dr. Cha
went to apologize.

842
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,159
But...

843
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:23,630
I don't think
things turned out very well.

844
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,670

That's it. Open up a little wider.

847
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,090
He was eating a cutlass-fish.

848
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,460
He was enjoying it,
but then a bone got stuck.

849
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,400
I see it. Forceps, please.

850
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,460
Okay.

851
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:16,039
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? Why?

852
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,170
I heard you shouldn't just...

853
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,840
pluck out fish bones
stuck in throats.

854
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,909
- Says who?
- The Internet.

855
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,480
Then why did you come to a hospital?

856
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,519
What?

857
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,050
Oh, silly me. Go on.

858
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,760
Open wide.

859
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:35,760
Good boy.

860
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:40,929
The Internet is a problem.

861
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:44,300
It's full of misleading information
and people come with diagnoses.

862
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,269
Why don't they just
get treated online too?

863
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,440
Thank you, doctor.

864
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,869
No problem.

865
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,139
Make sure it doesn't happen again.

866
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,440
Bye. And chew your food carefully.

867
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,280
I will. Goodbye.

868
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,349
Bye.

872
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,659
Hello, Doldam Hospital's ER.

873
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,500
Yes, go on.

874
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,159
Yes.

875
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:19,940
What?

876
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,170
What is it now?

877
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:47,829
What's wrong?

878
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,699
The saturation suddenly dropped.

879
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:50,900
The saturation?

880
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,969
(Saturation: Blood oxygen)

881
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,869
The lungs don't sound good.

882
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,340
(Lung sound: Sound of breathing)

883
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,340
The chest wall's retracting too.

884
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,909
Shall we intubate?

885
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,280
How much does the child weigh?

886
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,650
20kg.

887
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,409
- Do we have Broselow tape?
- Yes.

888
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,480
Get it now.

889
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,349
(Broselow tape: Color-coded tape
measure for pediatric emergencies)

890
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,349
It's blue.

891
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,360
Get a 5.5.mm endo tube right now.

892
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,760
- Uncuffed?
- Okay.

894
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,610
Ms. Oh. A patient with a terminal
renal failure is coming in.

895
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,079
And?

896
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,250
It's...

897
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,159
Is it pulmonary edema?

898
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,659
(Pulmonary edema:
Excess fluid in the lungs)

899

What's the urine output?

900
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,829
The input-output
is a positive 150cc.

901
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,300
It's hard to call it pulmonary edema
with just 150cc.

902
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,170
It's more likely pneumonia and ARDS.

903
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,869
(ARDS: Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome)

904
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:06,340
Run a full lab including CBC, CRP,

905
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,639
and ESR,

906

to the child's parents
very carefully.

- Yes?

I think you should
go to the ER right now.

918

Where? Who called?

919
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,889
A prison just called.

920
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,889
One of the inmates got hurt,

921
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:55,820
and he's on dialysis
for terminal renal failure.

He's serving a life sentence
for murder.

925
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,119
Dr. Seo, were you called to the ER?

926
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,750
Yes.

You only lose if you lash out
at people like that.

Do you know such people well?

933

It's not like our ER is full.

to our other patients!

the patient's vitals right now?

958
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:37,650
80 over 40, 110 beats.

959
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,219
He's bleeding heavily.

961
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,559
A terminal renal failure patient...

00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,489
is in shock due to
excessive bleeding.

963

00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,239
You seem to enjoy the thrill,

969
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,610
but I don't.

970
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,050
I want this hospital
to be safer and more stable.

971
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,849
What fool said that...

972
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:43,250
selecting patients
makes a hospital...

973
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,090
safer and more stable?

974
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,889
Either way, he's a lifer

Our hospital's system...

976
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,929
isn't good enough
to take someone like that.

977

possible dangers.

That's my principle.

979
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,929
Shouldn't we consider...

980
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,340
the safety of
our patients and staff?

981
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,880
Why are you contradicting yourself?

982
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,610
You think so much of
our staff's safety,

983
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,619
so why did you...

984
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:17,650
cover it up when
a fellow doctor was attacked?

985
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,059
They're two different cases.

986
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,360
That was an accident.

987

Dr. Cha admitted that she should
be responsible for her actions...

988
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,599
and even apologized.

989
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,070
What?

990
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,440
"An accident"?

991
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:38,269
Darn you.

992
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,440
What...

993
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:46,710
Look!

994
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,119
What...

995
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,260
Help me, please.

996
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,699
Sir?

997
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:07,000
Sir!

998
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,500
Get me a board, quick.

999
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:13,110
Bring the gauze. Hurry!

1000
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,610
Unbutton his shirt.

1001
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,480
Hurry.

1002
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,280
Hurry up!

1003
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,739
Checking for rhythm.

1004
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,550
Still nothing.

1005
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,880
I'll take over.

1006
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,519
Take a good look.

1007
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,530
Domestic violence
is never at random.

1008
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:10,730
Eun Jae was hurt while
trying to prevent this, but you...

1009
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,929
As the leader of this hospital,

1010
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,170
rather than helping
to stop this vicious cycle,

1011
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,409
you swept it under the rug.

1012
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:22,610
If we had called the police,
this would've never happened.

1013
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,750
Your principles? What a joke.

1014
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,550
You're only cowardly
avoiding any trouble...

1015
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,449
just to keep your hands clean.

1016
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,590
Master Kim, the paramedics...

1017
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,059
transporting the patient
just called.

1018
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:37,960
Usher them into the hybrid room
upon arrival.

1019
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,030
Yes, Master Kim.

1020
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,760
What? Do you have an objection?

1021
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,599
Checking for rhythm.

1022
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,349
Still nothing.

1023
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:20,570
(Doldam Hospital)

1024
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,650
(The wife was found dead
at the scene, but the son...)

1025
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,590
What do we do,

1026
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,260
Jessie?

1027
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,380
(Dr. Romantic 2)

1028
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,719
It looks like brain trauma.

1029
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:16,219
Could surgery save his life?

1030
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,760
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1031
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:20,059
Shouldn't the hospital
be restructured...

1032
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:21,960
so that it centers around you,
President Park?

1033
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,269
Please tell them
to be well-prepared.

1034
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,570
Who would give a murderer
his or her kidney?

1035
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,139
A transplant for someone
who isn't next in line?

1036
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:32,039
The paramedic about
to be declared brain dead...

1037
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,269
I won't agree to this.

1038
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,710
Is it because he's serving life?

1039
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,980
Suggesting we save who we can
doesn't make me wrong.

1040
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,809
All I want is to show our respects.

1041
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:40,920
Don't treat him as
just an organ donor...

1042
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:42,280
but a person.
