1
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,700
Honey, would you be able
to come home this weekend?

2
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,799
Byeol misses you.

3
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,439
When will you be working
at that new hospital?

4
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,549
Isn't it about time
our family lived together?

5
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,959
Oh, no...

6
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,980
Mr. Park.

7
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,250
Did you tell Master Kim
about what you found out?

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,590
No.

9
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,120
I thought he should
hear it from you.

10
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,659
Don't drag your feet
if you've made up your mind.

11
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,270
The hospital needs time
to find your replacement.

12
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,240
Right, of course.

13
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,460
Yes, what is it?

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
What?

15
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,199
A table death?

16
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,669
(Table death: patient
dying during surgery)

17
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,780
The son
of Sejin Group's chairman died?

18
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,050
What?

19
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,879
I never expected such an outcome...

20
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,919
from someone
as talented as Dr. Park.

(Song Hyun Cheol)

22
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:06,319
It stirred up a controversy
here at Geodae, you know.

23
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,189
The first course of action
he took at Doldam...

24
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,099
was taking VIP patients...

25
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,330
and even though
there were many urgent cases,

26
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,270
he chose the son of
Sejin Group's chairman.

27
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,840
The doctors here...

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,870
criticized him for
parading his power.

29
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,939
Gosh, how awful?
The patient died on the table?

30
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,939
Tell me about it.

31
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,479
A table death happening
while my plan is in motion?

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,520
I must have a guardian angel
watching over me.

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Sorry?

34
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,189
I don't think I follow.

35
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,189
I need you...

36
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,219
to be at Doldam tomorrow.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,030

41
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,180
Dr. Do In Beom?

42
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,949
You saw Dr. Do?

43
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,280
Ms. Uhm, you know In Beom too?

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,750
Of course, I do.

45
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,189
He worked at Doldam for two years.

46
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,689
For that long?

47
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,889
I didn't know about that.

48
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,189
You're in different departments,
so it's not that surprising.

49
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,160
I only heard rumors about him,

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
but I hear he's a cold city boy.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,600
I wouldn't put it like that.

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
He's more of a prickly nerd.

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,339
That's right.

54
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,470
He carries himself in a way...

55
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,540
that's not exactly
friendly or approachable.

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,339
It's just because
of the way he talks.

57
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,050
He has a gentle soul, you know.

58
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,420
And how is it that you know In Beom?

59
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,319
- What?
- I'm curious too.

60
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,660
You spoke about him
as if he's your friend.

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,430
Did I?

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,699
Do you know Dr. Do personally?

63
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,000
No, of course not.

64
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,240
That can't be more false.

65
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,870
I only bumped into him
a few times at Geodae.

66
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,769
That's all.

67

Mr. Park will receive
flap surgery tomorrow.

00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,730
Yes, doctor.

73
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,269
Excuse me,
but where's President Yeo?

74
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,540
In there.

75
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,620
His vitals are stable.

76
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,120
You should head downstairs
and get some rest.

77
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,529
It's all right. I got some shut-eye
during the night.

78
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,829
There's no need to worry.

What brings you by unannounced?

84
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,899
It wasn't until yesterday
that I heard about President Yeo.

85
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,209
He has terminal lung cancer?

86
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,569
Yes.

87
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,110
It wasn't spotted in time.

88
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,879
And how have you been?

89
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,879
Me? What about me?

90
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,750
I heard you had CTS.

91
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,519
I can't believe the rumors
even reached your ears.

92
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,060
Seo Jung's been
worried sick about you.

93
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,459
She told me to stick by your side
until you receive treatment.

94
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,199
If I don't, she might
hop on a plane herself.

95
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,069
Always the crazy one, isn't she?

96
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,110
So?

97
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,509
What's the real reason you're here?

98
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
Tell me.

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,550

just a personal visit.

This afternoon,

101
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,019
an investigative team
will be sent from Geodae.

102
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,790
What?

103
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,259
There will be an inquiry into
the table death...

104
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,000
that occurred here yesterday.

105
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,870
I'm a member on that team.

106
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,870
Four of them are lawyers
from a law firm...

107
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,579
and they will be joined by
a cardiologist, an anesthesiologist,

108
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,779
and me, a general surgeon.

109
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,610
Dr. Song will be leading the team.

110
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,790
He's sending quite
a handful of lawyers.

111
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,689
It's not what you'd expect
from a team...

112
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,259
investigating a table death.

113
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,759
What are you saying?

114
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,529
The target of this investigation...

115
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,370
will be Doldam Hospital.

116
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,639
I'm putting my trust in you.

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,910
- Of course.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,949
Is there a way to avoid
any serious repercussions then?

119
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,480
Dr. Park Min Guk.

120
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,789
What?

121
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,389
Throwing him under the bus...

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,990

putting pressure on Geodae.

126
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,490
The chairman's son died.

127
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,860
It's happening faster
that I expected.

128
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,500
At this rate, Dr. Park
might take the fall for this.

129
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,169
Before the inquiry begins,

130
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,629
we should get
our stories straight and...

131
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,240
I don't want to lie...

132
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,440
just so that I can avoid any rebuke.

133
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,440
Dr. Shim, come on.

134
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,610
We were only able
to begin the surgery...

135
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,049
because you signed off on it.

136
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,519
From what I recall,
I made myself clear...

137
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,019
on the risks
involving the WPW syndrome.

138
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,519
So you'll say that
and leave the rest of us hanging?

139
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,860
Whatever
the investigative team asks,

140
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,059
I will answer truthfully
and honestly.

141
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,230
I'll tell the truth
and leave my emotions aside.

so hear the details from him.

145

Don't worry, sir.
I'll talk some sense into her.

146

Don't worry.

Manager Jang, what's going on?

148

Dr. Park's VIP patient...

149
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,169
died on the operating table
during surgery yesterday.

150

I think they're here
because of that.

The VIP patient? By any chance,

152
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,179
are you talking about Kang Ik Joon?

153

Yes, that's right.

Dr. Shim.

155
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,340
Think about what will happen
to Dr. Park.

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,809
We'll all be doomed if you do this.

157
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,110
- Don't just think about yourself.
- What in the world happened?

158
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,820
We'll all end up in a mess.

What's your name?

167
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm Seo Woo Jin, a general surgeon.

168
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,779
So am I.

169
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,649
I know. You're two years my senior.

170
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,149
Dr. Do In Beom.

171
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,250
Why do you have this file?

172
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,450
Master Kim gave me homework.

173
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,559
You must be pretty good.

174
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,659
I guess I am.

175
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,769
I'll be off now. The ER needs me.

176
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
No, that's not it.

177
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,059
Yes.

178
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,690
Okay.

179
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,470
Can I leave this here for a while?

180
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,460
- What happened?
- He was in a traffic accident.

181
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,230
He had head-on collision
with a tree by the road.

182
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,490
He reeks of alcohol,
so I think he was drunk driving.

183
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,500
I can't believe
people still drink-drive.

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,970
He showed a verbal response
when we got there.

185
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,429
And his stomach was stuck
in the steering wheel.

186
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,240
- Tell me his vitals.
- 80 over 40.

187
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
Did you figure out who he is?

188
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,039
No, we haven't checked yet.

189
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,769
Write him down as John Doe for now.

190
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,809
Set up IV lines and hydrate him.

191
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,840
And don't forget
the operation laboratory test.

192
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,779
I also need two PRBCs
for an emergency.

193
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,950
- Should I bring a MAC catheter?
- Yes.

194
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,279
Sir. Sir.

195
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,519
His GCS levels are a total of 7.5.

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,759
Let's intubate.

197
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,019
- I need an RSI.
- Okay, I'll bring it.

198
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,629
Increase the etomidate
and rocuronium dosage by 1mg.

199
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:17,629
Okay.

200
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,759
Here's the MAC catheter.

201
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,039
His abdomen has inflated.

202
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,340
- Show me the FAST results.
- Okay.

203
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,750
(Bae Mun Jung)

204
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,710
(Jung In Soo)

205
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,279
(Do In Beom)

206
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,120
(General Surgeon Do In Beom)

207
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,679
I don't see any signs
of hemopneumothorax.

208
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,789
(Hemopneumothorax:
Hemo and pneumothorax)

209
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,850
It's not cardiac tamponade either.

210
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,220
Judging by his stomach,
he has hemoperitoneum.

211
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,059
(Hemoperitoneum:
Bleeding in the stomach)

212
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,330
Bingo.

213
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,029
Is his brain okay?

214
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,299
Hey, Dr. Do.

215
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,899
Long time no see, Dr. Jung.

216
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,169
What are you doing here?
When did you come?

217
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,210
Just a while ago.

218
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,009
Long time no see, Mr. Park.

219
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,250
Yes, it's been a long time.

220
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,580
But seriously, why are you here?

221
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,450
60 over 30. 140bpm.

222
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,519
Execute a full drop
of normal saline...

223
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,850
- and get us to more PRBCs.
- Okay.

224
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,259
Was he unconscious when he got here?

225
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,529
Yes, he's drunk.

226
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,360
So we're not sure if it's the brain
or the alcohol...

227
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,759
that's causing the unconsiousness.

228
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,860
Let's take a brain CT.

229
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
No.

230
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,629
First, we need to treat
his hemoperitoneum.

231
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,639
You're going to open him up
without checking his brain?

232
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,070
If we don't treat the bleeding
in his stomach,

233
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,710
you won't have time
to take a brain CT.

234
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,440
Then let's operate right away.

235
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,350
- Dr. Yun.
- Yes?

236
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,080
Call Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh
to the operating room.

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Okay.

238
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,019
Meanwhile, Dr. Seo and I will
open the patient's abdomen...

239
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,049
and take care of the bleeding
before we take him to the OR.

240
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,460
You're going to do it here?

241
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,960
You can do that, right?

242
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,159
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

243
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,659
Please sedate the patient.

244
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,470
We're going to do a laparotomy
on the John Doe.

245
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,169
I'll get ready.

246
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Oh my gosh.

247
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,710
What's going on?

248
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,919
Ik Joon really wanted
to give this to you.

249
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,630
It came from Seoul this morning.

250
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,539
Hey.

251
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm going to eat those macarons
after I'm done with the surgery.

252
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,039
So leave some for me, okay?

253
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,359
I'll be off now.

254
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,099
Wait.

255
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,299
I have a question.

256
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,569
Dr. Do is here?

257
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,410
Yes, he's in the hybrid room...

258
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,440
doing a laparotomy on a patient
with Dr. Seo.

259
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,140
The two general surgeons are going
to say hello over a laparotomy?

260
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,849
I want to see how it goes.

261
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,549
The patient will be here
as soon as they stop the bleeding.

262
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:00,980
So let's get ready
as fast as we can.

263
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,019
- Okay.
- Okay.

264
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,349
- How are his vitals?
- It's low. It's 60 over 40.

265
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,160
Okay, I'll perform the surgery.
Let's switch places.

266
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,230
He's my patient.

267
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,990
I'll perform the surgery.

268
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,059
I didn't come all the way here
to help a second-year fellow.

269
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,130
Exactly.

270
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,299
I don't want to bother you
since you came such a long way.

271
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll perform the surgery.

272
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,700
Scalpel.

273
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
Let's begin.

274
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,059
Gauze.

275
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Forceps.

276
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,240
Bovie.

277
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,529
There you are.

278
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,130
We were thinking about
going to your office.

279
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:25,869
What's all this?

280
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,970
I heard President Park
got himself in big trouble.

281
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,809
We didn't have a choice.

282
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,480
We need to at least pretend like
we're investigating what happened.

283
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,220
It's just a formality,
so don't let it bother you.

284
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,119
President Park
wants you in his office.

285
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,920
- Oh, really?
- Come this way.

286
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,160
Let's go.

287
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,930
What do you say?
Should I get rid of Park Min Guk...

288
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,440
and help you become the president?

289
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,339
Just go upstairs
and do your job properly.

290
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,210
Make a fair judgment
as a fellow doctor.

291
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,150
Don't make any biased decisions.

292
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,220
But this is a great chance for you
to get rid of Park Min Guk.

293
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Isn't it tempting?

294
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,049
If you came to find facts,
focus on finding facts.

295
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,890
Don't go and cause a ruckus.

296
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,589
You're such a weird character.

297
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,700
No wonder you live here like this.

298
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,759
Darn you.

299
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,470
Let's go. We should go.

300
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,910
There's not just blood.

301
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,079
- What's this?
- Looks like a perforated stomach.

302
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,380
Whelk and thin noodles
are everywhere.

303
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,680
My goodness.

304
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,950
- Irrigation.
- Suction.

305
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,089
The liver and spleen seem fine.

306
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,559
Keep irrigating.

307
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,099
I found the perforation site.

308
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,470
Repair that in the OR.

309
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,869
Now, just stop the bleeding.

310
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,109
You don't see it?

311
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,779
You're good with your hands
but have poor eyesight?

312
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,390
Gauze.

313
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,589
If you can't find it in three,
I'll do it.

314
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,329
One.

315
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Two.

316
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,440
- Three. Hands off.
- I found it.

317
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,869
It's the mesenteric artery.

318
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,470
Forceps.

319
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,079
Hemostat.

320
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:50,849
Tie, please.

321
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,849
Irrigation.

322
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,569
The BP's under control.

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,470
- Cut.
- Cut.

324
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,509
We're done.

325
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,509
We'll do the rest in the OR.

326
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,180
Cover him with a surgical drape
and move to the OR.

327
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,250
Before moving him,

328
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,279
check his brain and cervical spine.

329
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,880
I'll check before moving him.

330
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,400
Ms. Joo, portable oxygen, please.

331
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Okay.

332
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,970
Go easy on him.

333
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,779
He does just fine
without being pushed.

334
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,910
Why give the scalpel to a
second-year fellow? That's scary.

335
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,380
Didn't you want to
see him in action?

336
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,859
You must still dislike me, Mr. Park.

337
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,059
I just still find you uncomfortable.

338
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,000
Mr. Park.

339
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,299
Dr. Jung and Dr. Seo
are looking for you.

340
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,670
Here's the portable oxygen.

341
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,410
What?

342
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,009
Can I borrow a pen?

343
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,750
Pardon? Oh, sure.

344
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,849
You must be new here.

345
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,819
Yes. I'm Joo Young Mi.

346
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,259
I'm general surgeon Do In Beom.

347
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,130
Call this number
when you get the CT result.

348
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,029
Sure. I'll do that.

349
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,529
Thank you, Ms. Joo.

350
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,279
What are you doing, Dr. Do?

351
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,390
Do you know me?

352
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,289
Stop it.

353
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,349
What?

354
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,319
You said we should act
like strangers. It was your idea.

355
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,430
That's not what I'm talking about.

356
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,299
Why are you being nasty to people?

357
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,730
Especially to Dr. Seo.

358
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,299
And why Mr. Park?

359
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,329
This is what I'm like
at work. So what?

360
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,309
Please, stop acting like
you're so cool and great,

361
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,309
and try to get along.

362
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,910
What about you?
How's your studying coming on?

363
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,509
Your exam is coming up.

364
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,049
I'm managing.

365
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,650
If you don't pass in one go,
I'll tease you forever.

366
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,890
You bonehead.

367
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,859
How could you?

368
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,160
My gosh.

369
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,269
You two are that close? How so?

370
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,109
You have different surnames,
so you're not siblings.

371
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,039
A neighborhood friend?

372
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,079
A church friend?

373
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,450
Or... Just a guy you know?

374
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,589
They're cutting
even more budgets this month.

375
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,859
It can't be helped.

376
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:23,789
We must try to explain
why the funds are needed.

377
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,630
My gosh. It feels as if...

378
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,369
we're having a never-ending fight.

379
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,440
Let's think that we're all
just working hard at our jobs.

380
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,710
They're doing their best to
manage and maintain services,

381
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,480
and we're doing our best
to get our point across.

382
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,779
This thing called balance.

383
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,720
We might fight fiercely
for what we believe in...

384
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,660
if it's to be maintained.

385
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,160
I understand.

386
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,029
I'll fiercely prepare
the documents.

387
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,799
Dr. Bae.

388
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,500
Woo Jin's loan sharks backed down.

389
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,900
Was that your doing?

390
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,880
Well, I didn't do much.

391
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,150
I could no longer just watch
what he was going through.

392
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,380
Since when did you
worry about him so much?

393
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,220
You never cared for...

394
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,390
anything other than bones.

395
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,460
Didn't you come here...

396
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,230
because you wanted to
leave the worldliness behind?

397
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,460
I did. That's true.

398
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:38,069
Was it since you saw
the file on my desk on him?

399
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:42,809
(Seo Jin Ho, aged 47)

400
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,339
Tell me.

401
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,049
What connection
do you have with Woo Jin?

402
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,720
You really won't tell me?

403
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,890
There's nothing to tell, really.

404
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,319
Then why do you
speak to him so casually?

405
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,990
It's nothing.

406
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,900
You're not two-timing, are you?

407
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,640
Dr. Do and Mr. Park.

408
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,509
I'm not. You're talking nonsense.

409
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,410
What's this about two-timing?

410
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,240
Are you seeing two guys?

411
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,950
One must be Mr. Park.

412
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,549
Who's the other guy?

413
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,420
Excuse me.

414
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,250
Who is it? Who's the other guy?

415
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,549
What? Do...

416
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,829
Do...

417
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,660
Doldam Hospital rocks.

418
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,329
Doldam rocks.

419
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,609
I'm two-timing?

420
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,849
I've never dated anyone in my life.

421
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,660
("Family of Three
Attempts Suicide over Debt")

422
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,539
Yes, come in.

423
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,109
Hi.

424
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,450
Are you not busy?

425
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,650
Why? What's up?

426
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,589
Well... I have
something to tell you.

427
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,720
Okay, tell me.

428
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,720
- Just a moment.
- Sure.

429
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes, Manager Jang.

430
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
I see.

431
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,599
Okay, I'll come over.

432
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,839
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

433
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,269
President Park Min Guk.

434
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,380
It's about his table death
from yesterday.

435
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,410
Geodae Medical Center
sent a team to investigate.

436
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,920
Apparently, I'm needed
in the president's office.

437
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,519
Oh, then you should go upstairs.

438
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,690
No, I can spare a few minutes.

439
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,720
What's going on?

440
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,960
My issue isn't that urgent.

441
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
You go ahead.

442
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,900
Okay, then let's put out
the urgent fire first.

443
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,470
Then we can talk.

444
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,200
Sure.

445
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,839
Thank you, Dr. Jung.

446
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,839
Pardon?

447
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,539
Whenever I'm absent,

448
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,109
you know that you're in charge of
the hospital, don't you?

449
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:39,619
Yes.

450
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,450
Of course. I know that.

451
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,690
Keep it up then.

452
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,789
Okay.

453
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,329
This is just crazy.

454
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,839
(Operating Room 1)

455
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,980
- Good job.
- Good job.

456
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,180
Dr. Seo.

457
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,849
Can you come to the staff lounge?

458
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,289
A team from Geodae is here...

459
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,619
to investigate the table death
that occurred yesterday.

460
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,589
They'd like to question you
and Dr. Yang.

461
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,390
Right now?

462
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,529
You must be tired
after that surgery,

463
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,630
but we'd all appreciate
your cooperation.

464
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Sure. I'll just get changed first.

465
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,339
- Has it begun then?
- Yes.

466
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,440
I'd appreciate you two
returning to your stations too.

467
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,140
Sure thing. Ms. Oh, shall we?

468
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Sure.

469
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,509
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

470
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,440
Have a seat.

471
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,579
(Staff Lounge)

472
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,289
We will begin the inquiry.

473
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,289
Shall we begin then?

474
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,869
This first question goes to Dr. Seo.

475
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,170
You were the lead assistant
of Mr. Kang's surgery.

476
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,640
That's right.

477
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,079
How many times have you
assisted Dr. Park this way?

478
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,109
I've teamed up with him
three times before,

479
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,950
and two were as his lead assistant.

480
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,519
Normally, Dr. Yang
acts as Dr. Park's lead assistant.

481
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,849
Why was it different
in Mr. Kang's case?

482
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,190
My specialty lies with laparoscope.

483
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,230
However, we had to conduct
open surgery.

484
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,029
That's why.

485
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,130
Dr. Shim, we heard that
you were the first to doubt...

486
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,829
the WPW syndrome.

487
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,440
I had my doubts after
seeing the EKG results...

488
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,839
and I made myself clear
on the matter to Dr. Park.

489
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,049
Are you saying
you were against this surgery?

490
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,950
Then why did you
let the surgery take place?

491
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,220
Did the lead surgeon
pressure you in any way?

492
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,089
I refuse to comment.

493
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,789
How so?

494
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,559
They are my teammates.

495
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,529
I'd rather not refute
any comments by them.

496
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,069
Still, we'd appreciate an answer
for the sake of this investigation.

497
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,339
Of course.

498
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,140
It may be just a formality,

499
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,009
but an answer would be appreciated.

500
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,509
Did you push this surgery
or pressure your teammates...

501
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,349
even though your anesthesiologist
was against it?

502
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,250
I...

503
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,930
never forced my anesthesiologist...

504
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,759
to do anything.

505
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,029
How dare you let
a mere anesthesiologist...

506
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,000
get in the way of my plans?

507
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,269
The same goes for the internist.

508
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,240
Yes, Dr. Na. It's me.

509
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,740
When you're done consulting,
don't bother contacting Dr. Yang.

510
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:28,309
Send the report to me directly.
Right now.

511
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,519
I strongly made myself clear
on the dangers...

512
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,920
regarding the WPW syndrome.

513
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,490
All I received was a side-note.

514
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,859
I even suggested...

515
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,130
that we reschedule the surgery
after treating him at Geodae.

516
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:47,059
I consulted the internist,
and he said...

517
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,599
Mr. Kang could receive treatment
after the surgery.

518
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:52,769
Is this true?

519
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,609
Yes.

520
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,779
It's true.

521
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,619
You were part of another accident
that happened three years ago.

522
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,760
It was also a table death.

523
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,289
(Table death: patient
dying during surgery)

524
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,730
That's right.

525
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,900
You lost the second trial...

526
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,469
and ended up paying
a steep compensation.

527
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,769
Yes, that's right.

528
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,639
It even led to your divorce,
am I right?

529
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,579
You and your ex-husband
had a son together.

530
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,309
Who has primary custody of him?

531
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,019
What does that have to do
with this recent case?

532
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:45,190
Well, I didn't mean much.

533
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,059
The question was out
of pure curiosity.

534
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,099
Come on. Just think about it.

535
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,929
Dr. Park had everything
going for him.

536
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,670
What reason does he have
for risking such dangerous surgery?

537
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,469
Especially on a VIP patient.

538
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,179
He needed a score.

539
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
What?

540
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:11,349
What do you mean by that, Dr. Seo?

541
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,250
He failed to properly save
the Minister of National Defense.

542
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,150
And during his time here
as the president,

543
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,320
he couldn't add a notch
on his scoreboard.

544
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,659
Maybe it was eating away at him.

545
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,329
Hey, Woo Jin!

546
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,760
He was so desperate
that he even made the decision...

547
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,630
to change his lead assistant.

548
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,530
Am I wrong?

549
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,300
Just for one VIP patient,
he shut down...

550
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,869
Doldam's entire ER.

551
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,570
Even though a patient
cut a doctor's neck,

552
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:40,309
he didn't call the police
and swept the case under the rug.

553
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,409
He even used someone...

554
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,949
to poach the people
at this hospital.

555
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,519
- Hey!
- He's the president of Doldam,

556
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,190
he spent more of his time
with other shenanigans,

557
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,090
so of course,
he was getting anxious!

558
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,289
Do you have a death wish?

559
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,829
Dr. Yang, please calm down.

560
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,329
Let go of him.

561
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,659
Darn it!

562
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Just so you know,
this is his vengeance talking.

563
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,469
Dr. Park fired him
when he was at Geodae.

564
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,610
He ratted on a fellow doctor...

565
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,909
and violated the rules of misconduct
as a doctor.

566
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,340
That's why Dr. Park fired him...

567
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,510
and he's now trying
to get back for it.

568
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,019
This is slander!

569
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,690
Right, I hear you.

570
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,219
Look here, In Beom.

571
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,329
You know Dr. Park
just as well as I do.

572
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,929
You respect him too, don't you?

573
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,469
I do. He's a talented surgeon
and a man of class.

574
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:39,500
Right?

575
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,309
But this isn't a time to involve
personal feelings, Ho Jun.

576
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,739
A man died.

577
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,280
We heard what you had to say,

578
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,849
so we'll wrap up our questioning.

579
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,019
We could call you back
for follow-up questions,

580
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,929
so please stay within
hospital grounds today.

581
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:07,460
Good day then.

582
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,469
You jerk!

583
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,179
Darn you.

584
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,400
What was that, Dr. Seo?

585
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,300
What do you mean?

586
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,900
You only had to talk about
the table death.

587
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,070
And?

588
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:55,079
Did you have to mention
every one of Dr. Park's wrongdoings?

589
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,449
You said we should though.

590
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,550
Throwing him under the bus
is the only way to save Doldam.

591
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,150
That's why I set up a path for you.

592
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,489
Was I wrong to do so?

593
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,130
It seems like you misunderstood me,
Dr. Seo.

594
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,630
Do you know what
Master Kim hates the most?

595
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,900
It's playing office politics
within the hospital.

596
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,869
I never did such a thing.

597
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,869
Criticism, slander,
and making accusations.

598
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,139
If those get you what you want,
then it's office politics.

599
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,010
I only told the truth.

600
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,780
If you have any complaints,

601
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,079
you should take it up with him.

602
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,250
As if I'm a match for him.

603
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,090
He's the hospital president
while I'm a mere fellow.

604
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:39,019
He isn't someone I can mess with!

605
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,360
But you still...

606
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,789
chose to lay out
your emotions like that?

607
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,630
When emotions are added to facts,
it becomes an instigation.

608
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,869
The more you feel wronged,
the less you'll be heard.

609
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,300
When you're frustrated,

610
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,139
your word will carry less weight.

611
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,809
People will doubt you
because they won't know...

612
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,239
if you're telling the truth.

613
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,849
Even if you have enough hard facts,

614
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,820
mixing them with emotions
can ruin the entire picture.

615
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,389
Get it?

616
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,860
This place is off-limits.

617
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,099
No one will hurt Doldam Hospital
or Master Kim.

618
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,909
I won't allow it.

619
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,809
Did you do well at the inquiry?

620
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,380
No. Actually, I don't know.

621
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,119
About that patient Kang Ik Joon...

622
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:24,130
I hear he consented to the surgery
fully aware of the WPW syndrome.

623
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,230
Did you know that?

624
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,099
What are you talking about?

625
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,400
He knew.

626
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,739
- He knew?
- Yes.

627
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,940
Dr. Park Min Guk
explained everything to him.

628
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,179
But still...

629
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:46,449
(Consent for Surgery)

630
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,019
Let's not tell my parents.

631
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,320
Ik Joon.

632
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,690
This isn't something
you should hide.

633
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,389
The doctor said that
the surgery could go wrong.

634
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,599
I don't want to cause them
any more worries.

635
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,929
I haven't shown any symptoms yet,

636
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,130
and the doctor said
that my young age helps.

637
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,869
There's only a minimal chance
of the surgery going wrong.

638
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,340
Are you seriously
considering this surgery?

639
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,010
(Consent for Surgery)

640
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,050
(WPW syndrome)

641
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,780
(Kang Ik Joon)

642
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:20,579
Ik Joon,

643
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,219
what if something happens?

644
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,550
Then it'll be my time to die.

645
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,460
Either it's by the cancer...

646
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,590
or this WPW syndrome,

647
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,760
death will be the same.

648
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,500
(Kang Ik Joon)

649
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,769
So you're saying...

650
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:46,809
The patient was well aware
of his condition,

651
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:49,880
but still he consented
to the surgery.

652
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,250
If there weren't any
medical negligence...

653
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,280
There wasn't. I'm sure of it.

654
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,150
Then Dr. Park
can't be held accountable...

655
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,019
for this procedure.

656
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,219
A patient dying is never ideal,

657
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,929
but it wasn't malpractice.

658
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,159
Why hasn't the investigative team
been notified of this?

659
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,070
That's my question exactly.

660
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,070
Why are they blowing this case
out of proportion?

661
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:17,769
It seems like...

662
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,539
a follow-up investigation
must be conducted.

663
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,510
A follow-up investigation?
What are you talking about?

664
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,449
While investigating
the recent table death,

665
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,090
we came across
many systematic errors...

666
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,289
that have been taking place
at Doldam Hospital.

667
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,989
Some require
our immediate intention.

668
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,090
Which instances
are you talking about?

669
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,929
We'll know more
once we start investigating.

670
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,599
Are you sure you're not trying
to create such problems?

671
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,340
I also agree that Doldam
needs to be investigated.

672
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,909
On top of that,
a thorough evaluation...

673
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,980
of the medical staff
must be conducted.

674
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,949
I concur.

675
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,320
Me too.

676
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:07,960
Goodness. What a headache this is.

677
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:09,829
Oh, dear.

678
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,469
If that's what the team decided,
then that's what will be done.

679
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,340
They're the legal experts, right?

680
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,409
Don't you agree, President Park?

681
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,639
President Park?

682
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,809
Listen to me carefully.

683
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,780
I don't intend to...

684
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,219
find you at fault for this mistake.

685
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,119
However, it can't be wrapped up
as just a random mistake though.

686
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,630
An investigative team
will be headed to Doldam.

687
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,130
The table death will only
serve as a pretext.

688
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,269
The real objective...

689
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,599
will be a thorough investigation...

690
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,570
into Doldam's operations.

691
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,570
And what are you after?

692
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,880
There's only one thing...

693
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,480
I want.

694
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,820
Shutting down Doldam...

695
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,619
and building the foundation
of a new future.

696
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,920
In order to get what I want,

697
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:15,989
I need your utmost cooperation.

698
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:17,789
In some way,

699
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,300
this may be your only lifeline.

700
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,570
Manager Jang.

701
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:34,840
Yes, sir.

702
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,880
Let the investigative team...

703
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,320
look into all our files.

704
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,820
All of them?

705
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,429
Yes, get them anything they want.

706
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,170
Please cooperate.

707
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,809
Everything will go as they planned.

708
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,420
What they're after...

709
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,059
is a reason
to legally shut down Doldam.

710
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,630
They'll try to find
whatever reason they can.

711
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,130
So once they have a reason,

712
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,769
and Chairman Do
and President Park...

713
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,599
decide to shut down the hospital...

714
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,900
It can't be stopped.

715
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,940
An investigative team
in search of the truth?

716
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,010
Let's just call them
demolition experts...

717
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,409
because that's what they are.

718
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,610
It looks like...

719
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,179
they're even abandoning Dr. Shim.

720
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,289
Even after all this,

721
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,860
you wish to give Dr. Park a chance?

722
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,199
You still see hope in him?

723
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,590
Hi, Dr. Seo.

724
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,860
What are you doing?

725
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,460
I'm packing to save some time.

726
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,030
I'll probably soon be suspended.

727
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,030
Suspended?

728
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,699
Why?

729
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,769
That's how things
are shaping up to be.

730
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,570
They made a decision
from the moment the inquiry began.

731
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,670
The patient was fully aware
of the WPW syndrome...

732
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,409
and we had his consent.

733
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,309
You know,

734
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,679
instead of exhausting yourself
to avoid the responsibility,

735
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,150
it's sometimes better...

736
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,519
to just own up to it.

737
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,889
In the end, I was wrong
to consent to the surgery.

738
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,230
Whether I was pressured or not,

739
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,500
I must be held accountable
in some way.

740
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:11,630
I've been living my life
in his debt for the past few years.

741
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,440
It's nice to be unshackled from him.

742
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,769
Still, this is wrong.

743
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,010
If this isn't a case of malpractice,

744
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,079
the investigative team
should be long gone by now.

745
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,409
Look here, Dr. Seo.

746
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,889
The table death
is just an excuse for them.

747
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,190
Getting to the truth about it
isn't their real objective.

748
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,889
Don't you see it?

749
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,789
Then we shouldn't
let them find anything...

750
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:40,360
that they can use against us.

751
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,269
About Kang Ik Joon,
the patient who was in room 208...

752
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:22,940
Can you give me
his guardian's phone number?

753
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,239
Just a second.

754
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,420
Gosh, please pick up.

755
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,789
Please.

756
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,260
Please.

757
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,130
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

758
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,239
Are you looking for something?

759
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,539
The surgery consent form
signed by Kang Ik Joon.

760
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,610
Is it here?

761
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,679
Oh, that?
Dr. Yang took it this morning.

762
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,000
(Heart disease: WPW syndrome,
Diagnosis: Pancreatic cancer)

763
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,900
(Patient: Kang Ik Joon)

764
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,539
(Patient: Kang Ik Joon)

765
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:28,199
(Doctor: Park Min Guk)

766
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,280
If you're okay
with a photocopied version of it,

767
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,480
you should go ask Master Kim.

768
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,280
What? Master Kim?

769
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,050
Yes, he asked me to photocopy
the consent form.

770
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,760
He took it with him just now.

771
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,110
What are you doing?
Go ahead and take a look.

772
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,719
(Doctor: Park Min Guk,
Patient: Kang Ik Joon)

773
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,460
(Patient: Kang Ik Joon)

774
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,500
He not only had himself
sign the consent form.

775
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:30,699
He even signed a form saying
he was given an explanation...

776
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,570
regarding the WPW syndrome.

777
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,500
Won't this...

778
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:42,440
be enough to help you
avoid getting suspended?

779
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,239
Now,

780
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,179
it's time to tell those people
to stop going through everything...

781
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,179
and send them back.

782
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,449
Our job is to do our best
to save people in the OR.

783
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,590
We're destined to save our patients.

784
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,630
But there are times when we fail.

785
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,829
And that's what happened
to Kang Ik Joon yesterday.

786
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:41,500
As his doctor, you judged
that the aggressive cancer cells...

787
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,670
could be more of a threat to him
than the WPW syndrome.

788
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,409
And therefore, you pushed ahead
with the surgery.

789
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,550
I respect the choice you made.

790
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,250
It would've been better
if you had managed to save him.

791
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,349
And I'm sorry that you failed.

792
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:57,420
However,

793
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:01,789
you're playing politics
with the death of your patient.

794
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,429
And that's very wrong.

795
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,599
President Park.

796
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,800
I don't really know...

797
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,039
how big your ambition is.

798
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,840
But I still thought you had...

799
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,210
the least amount of pride
as a doctor.

800
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,610
Because you never once...

801
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:27,219
avoided treating a patient
or walked away from them.

802
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,349
I thought you were stubborn,

803
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,320
but I never thought
you were incompetent.

804
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,420
I also knew that you had a huge ego.

805
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,460
But because of that,
I also figured you'd never...

806
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:43,059
give up on your patient.

807
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:50,110
But I really didn't expect you
to suddenly show...

808
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,869
your true colors like this.

809
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,980
You hid those documents.

810
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,550
You abandoned your teammate.

811
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,949
And now,

812
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,420
you're even...

813
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,320
messing with Doldam Hospital.

814
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,590
What do you gain from doing this?

815
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,929
Please stop.

816
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,159
You're crossing the line.

817
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,630
Answer me.

818
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:22,099
What do you gain
from taking things this far?

819
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,340
Dr. Boo Yong Joo.

820
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,079
Your failure.

821
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,019
What?

822
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,030
Your hypocrisy and recklessness.

823
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,469
And the way you put on airs.

824
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,599
I wanted to reveal to everyone...

825
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:59,980
that you're wrong, full of lies,
and completely crazy.

826
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,280
I'm not the one who needs
to get off that bus!

827
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,920
It's you.

828
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,989
That's it?

829
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:17,389
You're threatening the hospital
and helping Do Yun Wan...

830
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:19,889
get what he wants
just because of me?

831
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,000
Just to see me fail?

832
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,199
Doldam Hospital is already a wreck.

833
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:25,969
You can do everything you can
to save it,

834
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,699
but you've already missed
the golden hour.

835
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,969
You can't just declare
someone's death like that...

836
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,239
just because you think
you can't save them.

837
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,539
You must think...

838
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,980
you're the only one
who's always right and ethical.

839
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,119
But don't you dare look down
on my pride,

840
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,920
my countless efforts,

841
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,630
and all the things I've achieved.

842
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,630
You don't have the right
to belittle me like that.

843
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,469
Do you understand?

844
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,840
Listen to me, President Park.

845
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,179
It turns out you're not a fool.
You're just a piece of trash.

846
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,619
Your obstinacy and bullheadedness...

847
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,619
have caused you to build
an arrogant belief... No.

848
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,960
You can’t call that a belief.

849
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,130
It’s just an obsession
that was made...

850
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,429
by your greed and delusion.

851
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,130
I once thought...

852
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,500
it’d be nice...

853
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,039
to have you work here
at this hospital.

854
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,280
You had a pretty nice reputation
as a doctor.

855
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,250
But now, I'm grateful.

856
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,050
Thank you...

857
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,190
for letting me know
that it was a useless thought.

858
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,429
Okay then.

859
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,829
While you're still the president
of the hospital,

860
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,230
(President, Park Min Guk)

861
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,969
I want you to deal with the mess...

862
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,039
that you've created.

863
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,440
I’m no longer going to wait...

864
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,119
or be patient.

865
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,539
(President's Office)

866
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,099
To be honest,
you guys are such an eyesore to us.

867
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,469
Do you know that?

868
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,179
Why?

869
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:22,179
Because you make us
feel uncomfortable.

870
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,250
We all thought
we were doing our best.

871
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,090
But when we're here with you guys,

872
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,559
it makes us feel embarrassed
to think that way.

873
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,300
But we're too proud
to acknowledge that.

874
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:46,940
We should all know...

875
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,039
what we're working so hard for.

876
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:02,449
He said his left chest hurt,
so I took a chest X-ray.

877
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,019
His left lung looks weird.

878
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:05,250
Don't you agree?

879
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,920
I'll run it through the AI program.

880
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,960
Incoming!

881
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,889
- Tell me the result.
- Okay.

882
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:21,639
What's the problem?

883
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,739
A stomachache.

884
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:24,639
I told him to watch what he eats.

885
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,510
He ate too much this morning
and is now in pain.

886
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,539
Sir, I'll have a look at
your stomach.

887
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,780
What kind of operation did he have?

888
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,849
A long time ago,
he got a hole in his intestine,

889
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,250
and they cut out a bit of it.

890
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,789
A long time ago? How long ago?

891
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:40,619
That was years ago,
when he was young.

892
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,789
Was that over 40 years ago now?

893
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:44,760
- Yes, about that long.
- 40 years ago?

894
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:45,960
What about this?

895
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,099
Five years or so ago,
he had his gallbladder taken out.

896
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,130
What are his vitals?

897
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,000
145 over 80, 70bpm, 36.8℃.

898
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,739
- Bed 9, please.
- Okay.

899
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,340
- Ms. Uhm. Get some X-rays.
- Okay.

900
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,639
We'll put him on fluids during
the operation laboratory test.

901
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:58,869
Give him some tramadol too.

902
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,969
Yes, doctor.

903
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,119
- I have a reading.
- Okay.

904
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,150
It's a pneumothorax.

905
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,349
What is it? Do you have something?

906
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:13,420
We have your X-ray results.

907
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,889
There's air in your chest.

908
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,460
- What?
- Air in my chest?

909
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:19,590
My gosh, doctor. Save me!

910
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,000
You're back.

911
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,860
You told me to come back if it hurt.

912
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,530
I told you to see a urologist
if it hurts again.

913
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,530
When?

914
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,170
When I prescribed the medicine.

915
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:30,269
I said the medication
might not be enough.

916
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:32,869
If so, you must see a urologist
to get lithotomy.

917
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,039
I clearly said so.

918
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,210
You never said anything of the sort!

919
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:38,079
- Lie down.
- I'm dying!

920
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,480
- Stop the pain!
- Dr. Jung!

921
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
I'm coming.

922
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,920
- Just a moment.
- It hurts.

923
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:48,789
I tripped up while
walking down a mountain.

924
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,190
I tore open my forehead.

925
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,659
- Oh, I see. Ms. Joo!
- Yes?

926
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:55,130
Take this patient
to the hybrid room.

927
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,860
- Come this way.
- Do something!

928
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,469
- Just a moment.
- Can you explain the rest?

929
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,469
Okay.

930
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,940
- Dr. Yun, call Dr. Seo!
- Okay!

931
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,139
- Doctor!
- What?

932
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:05,739
My child fell off a slide
and can't walk.

933
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:06,739
She can't walk?

934
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,110
I said I'm dying here! Do something!

935
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,510
Doctor, you didn't
finish explaining.

936
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,480
You're fine. Kid, hang in there.

937
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,719
Doctor!

938
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,519
- What are you doing?
- Help me out first.

939
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:19,250
Just a moment.
Okay, give me a moment.

940
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,559
Just wait!

941
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:21,690
I can't wait!

942
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,320
I can't breathe properly.

943
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,690
Doctor, do something!

944
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,389
This is insane.

945
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:30,969
Dr. Jung, what's going on?

946
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:32,269
Shall I help out?

947
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:33,469
Yes, Master Kim.

948
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:36,940
Can you treat the laceration
patient in the hybrid room?

949
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,940
- Okay, I got that.
- Thank you.

950
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,269
Oh, wait, I forgot.

951
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,780
What was it
you were going to tell me?

952
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:46,650
- Pardon? Well, that was...
- Doctor! Doctor!

953
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,280
- Doctor!
- Why isn't anyone helping me?

954
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:52,190
Is it important?

955
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,519
Then speak up now.

956
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,159
It's nothing.

957
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,889
I'll sort it out.

958
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:01,030
- Dr. Jung!
- I'm coming!

959
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,059
- Take the laceration case.
- Okay, go.

960
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,670
Dr. Yun, go to the kid!

961
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,929
My goodness.

962
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,340
Lie on your back, sir.

963
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,980
And so Dr. Jung...

964
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:18,380
ended up staying at Doldam Hospital.

965
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,750
Doctor!

966
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:22,820
Honey.

967
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,190
Yes. That's how it went.

968
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:28,519
The hospital they mentioned.

969
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,090
I checked and the place is a mess.

970
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,960
The raise was a lie,

971
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,800
and the other options are terrible.

972
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,760
Of course.

973
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:39,670
Doldam Hospital is much better.

974
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,739
Staying and working here quietly...

975
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:44,440
and waiting for...

976
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,539
an opening at Geodae
seems like a much better option.

977
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,610
Yes, of course.

978
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,679
Dr. Jung. You have a patient.

979
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:54,719
Honey, I have to go.

980
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:56,119
I'll call again soon.

981
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,150
I love you, lots and lots.

982
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,889
I'm coming, okay?

983
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:10,969
I'm glad it looks like
everyone overcame their hurdles.

984
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,210
You're...

985
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,820
fighting with us, aren't you?

986
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,289
(Park Min Guk)

987
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,730
What will you do?

988
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:48,699
About the investigative team.

989
01:02:58,949 --> 01:02:59,949
Give it to them.

990
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:02,849
But sir.

991
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:05,289
Don't you see?

992
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,329
We've lost this fight.

993
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,199
So what? You'll just back down?

994
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,340
What else can we do then?

995
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,170
They provided
a consent form that shows...

996
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,179
the patient agreed to everything.

997
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:31,650
Even the dead patient's
guardian's here...

998
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,880
saying there were no problems
with the consent form.

999
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,219
Yes. Ik Joon heard
the explanation himself...

1000
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:39,619
and signed the form.

1001
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:41,659
- What's going on?
- That's it then.

1002
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,460
You fool. Hang up!

1003
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,860
Come on now.

1004
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,530
The older you get,

1005
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,500
the classier one should become.

1006
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,739
Those fools.

1007
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,750
I told them what to do
and they still messed up.

1008
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,679
You idiots.

1009
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,889
- Chairman Do.
- What?

1010
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,289
You have a visitor.

1011
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:29,199
I'm a bit late, Chairman Do.

1012
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,719
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

1013
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,559
I should go. My work here is done.

1014
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,860
A bowel obstruction case came in.

1015
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,929
It has not yet developed
into necrotic.

1016
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,960
I'm thinking of a laparoscopic
adhesiolysis.

1017
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,469
(Separation with a laparoscope)

1018
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:58,969
Will you show me how it's done?

1019
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,139
It's a small bowel obstruction.

1020
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,809
I'll begin the adhesiolysis.

1021
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,440
I haven't been in
Dr. Do's OR in a while.

1022
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,849
You're the best with a laparoscope.

1023
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,079
Thank you.

1024
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,050
But today, Dr. Seo is in charge.

1025
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:17,719
Me?

1026
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:20,219
I'll assist you well. Give it a go.

1027
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,460
Can you do it?

1028
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:24,559
Let's swap places.

1029
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:37,570
I'll begin.

1030
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:38,840
Scalpel.

1031
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:44,210
Bovie.

1032
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:48,949
- Kelly forceps.
- Kelly forceps.

1033
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,420
Trocar.

1034
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,059
Gas on.

1035
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,400
The cavity isn't filling up well.

1036
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,300
It happens when there's an adhesion.

1037
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,340
Camera.

1038
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,179
Scalpel.

1039
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,650
Kelly forceps.

1040
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:26,320
Trocar.

1041
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,769
The adhesion looks bad.

1042
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:43,170
- Dissector.
- Grasper.

1043
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,639
Energy device.

1044
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,059
You gave him homework.

1045
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,469
Woo Jin said so?

1046
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:15,440
I saw our project file on his desk.

1047
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,170
In a year or two,

1048
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,039
both you and Dong Joo
will have to brace yourselves.

1049
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,179
That can't be.

1050
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:24,980
Do you have favorites now?

1051
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,289
When will you have surgery
for carpal tunnel syndrome?

1052
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:37,789
After Woo Jin finishes his homework.

1053
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,460
That's when I receive the surgery.

1054
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,139
The surgery...

1055
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,110
went great.

1056
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:58,079
I owe it to your guidance.

1057
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,809
I learned a lot.

1058
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:02,380
To a surgeon,
experience is everything.

1059
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,119
You get what I'm saying, right?

1060
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,320
Yes, I do.

1061
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:10,489
Until I come back,
look after Doldam for me.

1062
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,730
You'll come back?

1063
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:15,059
Didn't you know?

1064
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,329
This is my place of work.

1065
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,699
I'm only briefly lending
my services to Geodae.

1066
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,069
- I see.
- Also,

1067
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,939
make sure you come through
with Master Kim's homework.

1068
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:31,250
Your mentor asked you
to diagnose his condition.

1069
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:34,979
He wouldn't have asked just anybody.

1070
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:53,529
(Doldam Hospital)

1071
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,880
And so you left
without saying goodbye?

1072
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,750
Well, we had risky moments,

1073
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,149
but no one found out about us.
Right?

1074
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:12,220
All right, then. You take care too.

1075
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,289
Oh, and tell Auntie I said hi.

1076
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,260
Okay, got it.

1077
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,569
How long have you
been standing there?

1078
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,140
Before you came in.

1079
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,739
I see.

1080
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,279
Why didn't I see you though?

1081
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,479
Anyway,

1082
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:47,119
who were you talking to
on the phone?

1083
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,510
It's the ICU. President Yeo!

1084
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,289
Dr. Yun. Dr. Yun?

1085
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:52,920
Unbelievable.

1086
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,090
Dr. Yun, where are you?

1087
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:00,390
Where are you headed?

1088
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,960
The ICU to see President Yeo.

1089
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,289
(Oddball Project)

1090
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,329
(Oddball Project)

1091
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,279
(We thank Yang Se Jong
for his special appearance.)

1092
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,869
(Dr. Romantic 2)

1093
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:49,970
Eun Jae is being
sent back to Geodae.

1094
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,210
What do I do with her?

1095
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,869
Just tell her how you feel.

1096
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,380
Aren't you going to ask me to stay?

1097
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,279
Are we still good?

1098
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,180
Does Master Kim have
something other than CTS?

1099
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:04,380
I think I found
what you told me to look for.

1100
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,090
Mr. Park! I need your help.

1101
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,560
Is that enough to drive Master Kim
out of Doldam Hospital?

1102
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,159
And you still think you're in
a condition to conduct surgery?

1103
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:17,159
I am seriously considering
your dismissal.
