1
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,820
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,259
I, as a human,

3
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,600
and a doctor...

4
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,439
Dr. Park Min Guk of
Geosan University Medical Center.

5
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,739
Never have I...

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,709
been ashamed
or disappointed in myself.

7
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,920
The duodenum...

8
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,349
Rather than money or fame,

9
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,689
I believed that
patients' lives came first.

10
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,719
I have kept true to that principle.

11
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,390
But...

12
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,099
that accident...

13
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,700
shook up my whole world.

14
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,439
In the face of shock and terror,

15
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,269
my weakness overpowered
anyone's will to live.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,879
My strong but cowardly desire
to stay alive...

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,609
outweighed any principle I had.

18
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,909
- Get out of there.
- Hurry on out!

19
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,250
Thus,

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,049
I ran away to save myself.

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,549
But he...

22
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,420
stayed behind to save someone else.

23
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,459
Her heart stopped!

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,449
I'm here, Master Kim.

25
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,219
Master Kim?

26
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,889
Can you take this?

27
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,289
Master Kim, are you all right?

28
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,030
Let me take over.

29
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,840
How is the victim doing?

30
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,319
He's barely breathing
and it's hard to feel a pulse.

31
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,449
Master Kim, his vein
is excessively expanded.

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
The umbrella that impaled him...

33
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,590
must be putting pressure
on his heart.

34
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,300
Woo Jin, did you bring
the emergency kit?

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,659
Yes, I did.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,469
Open the kit.

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,469
There should be a chest tube inside.

38
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,840
Something is stuck
in his right chest.

39
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,909
I don't think we can intubate.

40
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,479
We need to lift the bus first.

41
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,409
Mr. Heo, is the crane here?

42
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,750
Yes, they're probably getting ready
to lift the bus.

43
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,919
Okay.

44
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,919
Help.

45
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,560
My legs...

46
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,199
How long has it been
since the accident?

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,540
About 30 to 40 minutes.

48
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,879
His legs have been stuck here
for 30 to 40 minutes.

49
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,709
It's possible that he could have
crush syndrome.

50
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,250
If you lift the bus all of a sudden,
he might have a cardiac arrest.

51
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,149
We need to give him IV fluids
and lift the bus very slowly.

52
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,920
It's minus 10 degrees right now.

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,160
If we take too long,
it could be more dangerous.

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,860
If we lift the bus right now,
he could have a cardiac arrest.

55
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,560
If we don't lift the bus,
this patient will expire.

56
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
(Expire: Die)

57
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,620
(Chapter 10: The effects of
an adequate amount of anxiety)

58
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,360
Please make sure
everything is in the right order.

59
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,430
Ms. Oh, did we get any calls
from the scene?

60
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,399
No, I think it's taking a while
to rescue everyone.

61
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,470
There are three doctors there,
so don't worry.

62
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,899
Shouldn't you get ready for surgery?

63
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,310
I'll go when I need to go.
Mind your own business.

64
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,379
Dr. Yun.

65
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,110
- Yes?
- Come here.

66
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,120
Okay.

67
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,759
Here's a blanket.

68
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,160
Give me a neck support.

69
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,290
Here's the neck support.

70
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,930
The patient is in cardiac arrest.

71
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,069
Take her to the ER
and perform CPR, okay?

72
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,100
Okay.

73
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,709
Let's move him.

74
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,540
1, 2, 3.

75
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,439
Be careful.

76
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,589
We've buckled the belts.
Let's move the patient now.

77
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,819
We're moving a patient!

78
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,920
Be careful.

79
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Slowly.

80
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,060
Doctor.

81
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,259
I can't feel my legs.

82
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,660
Do we have sodium bicarbonate?

83
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,139
I don't see any.

84
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,639
Let's set up an IV line
and give him fluids.

85
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,939
Are you going to give up
on this patient?

86
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,550
We know for a fact
that we can't save both.

87
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,750
So we need to choose.

88
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,620
On top of that,
he's still conscious.

89
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,889
Mr. Heo.

90
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,360
How long will it take
to lift this bus?

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,589
How long is it going to take
to lift the bus?

92
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:04,199
We're all ready.
Just give us the sign.

93
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,529
Let's wrap his legs
with elastic bandages.

94
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,529
Then let's have them lift the bus.

95
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,699
Give me some elastic bandages.

96
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,509
Have you gone nuts? Then he'll
definitely have crush syndrome.

97
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,480
It's a fifty-fifty chance.

98
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,310
You're going to risk it
when you're not even sure?

99
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,519
We can't let that uncertainty...

100
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,689
make us give up on a patient
that's still alive.

101
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,620
They both could die!

102
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,490
They're both alive right now.

103
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,959
And I'm going to save them both!

104
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,300
Do you understand?

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,670
Master Kim, the patient's
blood pressure is dropping.

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,939
Please help.

107
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,310
I thought he was either...

108
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,120
a lunatic or a malicious liar.

109
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,550
But he's...

110
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,620
Mr. Heo,
please have the crane ready.

111
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,930
When I give you a sign,

112
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,459
have them raise the bus
only 50cm high.

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,170
Is the crane ready?

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,930
Will this be okay?
There are people inside.

115
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,170
Yes, raise the bus 50cm high
once I give you the sign.

116
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,569
Okay.

117
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,470
- Eun Jae.
- Yes?

118
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,209
I want you to do
a thoracostomy on that patient.

119
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,709
Can you do it?

120
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,209
Yes, I can do it.

121
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,350
Okay.

122
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,389
If something happens to him,

123
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,950
his death will be on your hands.

124
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,370
Be careful.

125
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,700
I'm ready, sir.

126
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,139
Lift the bus!

127
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
Operate the crane!

128
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,779
Okay.

129
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,559
Mr. Heo, give me an IV line.

130
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:54,669
Okay.

131
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,350
Incoming!

132
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,549
Dr. Yun, I want you to keep an eye
on the patients.

133
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,620
- Call me if anything happens!
- Okay.

134
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,250
Please move this.

135
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,759
Mr. Park and Ms. Uhm,
I want you guys to help Dr. Yun.

136
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,820
- Got it.
- Okay.

137
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,059
Ms. Oh!

138
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,659
Let's move the patient. 1, 2, 3.

139
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,970
1, 2, 3.

140
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,110
How long has she been
in cardiac arrest?

141
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,070
She was like this during the rescue
and our way here.

142
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,269
So it's been about 15 minutes.

143
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,580
Keep compressing her chest.

144
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,409
We'll check her heart rate
once the monitor is connected.

145
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,509
Give her 1mm of epinephrine
through an IV line every 3 minutes.

146
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,509
Okay.

147
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,080
- Pass me a tube.
- Okay.

148
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,720
The monitor is connected.

149
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:48,990
Let's check her heart rate.

150
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,690
- Asystole.
- Ms. Oh.

151
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,090
Pull her womb to the left
as much as you can.

152
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,129
Okay.

153
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,470
It looks like she's been pregnant
for over 36 weeks, right?

154
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,539
Her fundal height is about 36cm.

155
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,200
The baby is big enough
to have viability.

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,970
Let's check if the fetus
is still alive.

157
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,080
Fix it to 20cm.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
Let me see the sonogram.

159
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,320
Cut her top.

160
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,700
The fetus is alive.

161
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,629
But the heart rate is too slow.

162
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,230
- We need to do a C-section.
- A C-section?

163
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,669
I think we need to conduct a PMCD.

164
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,700
Okay.

165
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,539
- We're going to do it here?
- I see signs of fetal distress.

166
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,970
Even if we keep
compressing her chest,

167
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,039
the blood won't reach the placenta.

168
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,879
If we don't take the baby out,
the mother and baby could both die.

169
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,980
Ms. Oh, we need a life support kit
for newborn infants and a NICU.

170
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,149
We have the life support kit ready.

171
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,519
And Jungil Hospital agreed
to let us use their NICU.

172
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,620
Ms. Joo will take the baby there.

173
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,220
Get ready to do
a neonatal resuscitation.

174
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,120
Start performing the resuscitation
as soon as the baby is out,

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,559
and run to the ambulance.

176
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
Okay.

177
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,730
Who's going to do the surgery?

178
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,960
I'll do it.

179
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,429
Then I'll assist.

180
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,769
Ms. Joo, please have
the surgery tools ready.

181
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,769
Okay.

182
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,000
Just stay still or go home.

183
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,809
- I need someone to take over.
- Got it.

184
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,350
All done, sir!

185
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Take the patient
to the hospital right now.

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,990
We need to move another patient!

187
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,789
His heart rate has dropped to 60bpm.

188
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,929
His blood vessels have contracted
due to the cold.

189
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
I need a 20 gauge needle.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay.

191
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,870
He's going to find
the external jugular vein?

192
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,909
His heart rate is getting slower.

193
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,980
He has hyperkalemia.

194
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,480
What are you going to do now?

195
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,659
Master Kim.

196
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,129
Okay. Let's hurry.

197
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,470
Okay.

198
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,070
- Execute a full drop.
- Okay.

199
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:27,179
Okay. This isn't warm saline.

200
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,309
So make sure he stays warm.
Now, take him to the hospital.

201
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,549
Okay.

202
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,580
We have another patient!

203
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,019
This way.

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,700
Oops.

205
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,269
He made it.

206
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,840
Let's move him.

207
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,309
- Ready.
- 1, 2, 3.

208
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,559
Don't stop CPR.

209
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,629
Scalpel.

210
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,570
CPR, 19 minutes and counting.

211
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,600
I'll cut the skin vertically...

212
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
and uterus transverse.

213
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
(Transverse: Horizontally)

214
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,870
- Cutting in.
- Gauze.

215
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,710
I'm into the abdominal cavity.
Hold tight.

216
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,480
1, 2, 3.

217
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,350
- I see the womb.
- Give me Richardson retractor.

218
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,419
I'll cut into the womb.

219
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,759
Remove the tools.

220
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,639
- Push down.
- Okay.

221
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,409
I see the baby's head.

222
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,879
It's coming out.

223
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,289
Baby out. Time is 19:25.

224
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,259
Kelly forceps.

225
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,730
Scissors.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,509
Keep checking.

227
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,610
Keep compressing.

228
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,350
The placenta's coming.

229
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,289
I'll finish up. Sutures.

230
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,059
Please, please, please.

231
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,870
Please, please.

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,240

Please, please, please.

234
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,340
Please, please. Please. Please.

235
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Cut.

236
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:27,860
Ms. Oh?

237
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,730
Sorry.

238
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,960
It's not working. Let's intubate.

239
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,849
What a relief.

240
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,130
The ambulance is outside.

241
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,829
Jungil Hospital is
20 minutes away, Ms. Joo.

242
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,440
Don't worry.
I'll get the baby there safely.

243
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,670
Wait.

244
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,680
ROSC.

245
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,720
She's back. The mom is back.

246
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,670
Get the central line.
Give her norepinephrine.

247
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,009
We'll move the mom
and baby together.

248
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,470
Okay.

249
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:25,880
The mom...

250
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,549
must've heard the baby's cry.

251
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,089
Patient coming through!

252
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,630
Make way.

253
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,430
Good job, Ms. Oh.

254
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,269
Dr. Yun.

255
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,980
Can you and Ms. Oh come over?

256
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,450
The EMT said...

257
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,920
she was found collapsed on the road
near the accident site.

258
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,059
She doesn't look like
one of the injured from the bus.

259
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,910
We should call the police first.

260
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,509
- It's that, isn't it?
- Yes.

261
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,279
I think she's a rape victim.

(Jungil Hospital)

263
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,700
Be careful.

264
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,700
- Can you manage on your own?
- Yes. Don't worry.

265
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,970
I'll come with you.

266
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
My youngest sibling was born
a month earlier...

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,079
than the due date.

268
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,710
My experience could be of some help.

269
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,579
Can I come along?

270
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,390
Thank you.

271
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,420
Go.

272
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,930
Close the door.

Oh, my gosh.

275

- Eun Jae.
- Yes?

276
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,759
Run a pre-op lab right away...

277
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,230
and rush him to the OR.

278
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,799
Take a chest portable on the way,

279
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,670
and his crushed right arm
must be amputated.

280
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,039
Take an x-ray first,
then call Dr. Bae...

281
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,369
and ask if he can operate on him.

282
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,609
- Okay?
- Yes, I got it.

283
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,710
Now hurry.

284
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,349
How is he?

285
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,279
Both legs were caught under the bus.

286
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,619
When the bus was lifted,
the decompression...

287
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,019
brought upon crush syndrome.

288
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,519
His heart rate is dropping.

289
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,359
I think he has hyperkalemia.

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,759
Almost a liter of fluids
are in already.

291
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,259
Order a BGA first.

292
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,289
Okay.

293
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,630
- Vitals?
- 100 over 70, 60bpm.

294
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,309
Doctor, are you okay?

295
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,240
Yes. I'm fine.

296
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,309
Can you go to Dr. Bae...

297
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,849
and ask him to come and see me?

298
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,619
Go inside first. It's cold.

299
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,619
Okay.

Dr. Seo knows as well.

304
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,000
Did you have to go and tell him?

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,799
I noticed first.

306
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,769
It's not serious.

307
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,740
Don't go spreading word.

308
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,279
You tell patients
not to hide their pain.

309
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,220
Why are you hiding yours?

310
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,349
Am I a patient?

311
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,420
A doctor in pain becomes a patient.

312
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,490
What?

313
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:08,259
Are you lecturing me now?

314
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm showing concern.

315
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,400
Well...

316
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,099
I have to work here for 10 months.

317
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:23,039
If you fall ill,
that won't do any good for me.

318
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,380
Nine months.

319
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,609
What?

320
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:31,109
You paid me a month's wages.
You have nine months to go.

321
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,490
Hang on.

322
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,490
What?

323
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,759
Oh, dear.

324
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,599
Am I hurt?

325
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,500
Yes, the cut isn't deep,
but the bleeding hasn't stopped.

326

Let's clean the wound
and stitch you up.

327

It's fine.

328
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,210
I'm sure it'll heal itself
with bandages.

329
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,710
You could have tetanus.

330
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,079
Then I'll get myself a shot
later on.

and Td shot.

00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,220
You'll take care of it first.

334
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,519
What? But Woo Jin...

335
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,460
Master Kim.

336
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,430
Yes, Ms. Oh.

337
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
Am I interrupting something?

338
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,640
No, of course not.

339
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,640
We were discussing surgical options
for our emergency patients.

340
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,579
What brings you by though?

341
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,650
We have a rape victim in our ER.

342
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,119
What?

343
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,420
We called the police,

344
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,319
but she's not in good shape.

345
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,990
There's bleeding
in the abdominal cavity.

346
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,259
Really?

347
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,289
Woo Jin,

348
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,799
hurry over to the ER,
assess the damage, and report back.

349
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,599
But Master Kim...

350
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,799
There's bleeding
in the abdominal cavity.

351
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
It could lead her to
go into shock.

352
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,599
Go.

353
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,210
Get going.

354
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,150
Yes, Master Kim.

355
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,059
Dr. Bae,
you should also hurry out...

356
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,829
and check the patient
that came in with crush syndrome.

357
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,000
Get going already.

358
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,099
Yes, Master Kim.

359
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,869
- Good luck out there.
- Sure.

360
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,849
Ms. Oh, can you hurry over to the OR
and help Dr. Cha?

361
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,750
There's a victim with
an umbrella in his chest.

362
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,220
I'll change clothes
and hurry up there myself.

363
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,660
- Yes, Master Kim.
- Good.

364
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,630
Master Kim.

365
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,960
Yes?

366
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,930
Are you sure you're all right?

367
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,670
Yes, of course.

368
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,309
I'm fine.

369
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,079
(Triamcinolone)

370
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,720
I'll take her to the hospital
within the Sunflower Center.

371
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,789
She's in no condition
to be transferred right now.

372
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,390
How bad is it?

373
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,529
Her abdomen is bruised all over
so we ran a sonography test.

374
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,059
Blood has pooled around her spleen.

375
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,160
A CT scan will tell us
just how much.

376
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,670
- How are her vitals?
- Her blood pressure is normal...

377
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,940
Then transfer her to the hospital
at the Sunflower Center.

378
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,400
You don't even have
an obstetrician here.

379
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,410
Our hospital has
an emergency rape kit on hand.

380
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,410
After the CT scan,

381
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,549
I will run
the tests needed myself...

382
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,579
and hand over any evidence
the police might need.

383
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,950
Evidence becomes less viable,
the longer we wait.

384
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,849
You won't catch
the culprit at this rate.

385
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,059
Would you rather it be a killer
than just a rapist?

386
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:33,720
Look here, Dr. Yun.

387
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,460
That was a bit harsh, don't you say?

388
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,789
I'm sorry if I came off like that.

389
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,200
Dr. Yun, the patient is awake.

390
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,609
Ma'am, can you hear me?
You're at the hospital.

391
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,180
It's all right. You're safe here.

392
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:55,349
I'm going to ask a few questions.

393
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,480
The police... A police officer...

394
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,349
Yes, a police officer
is right outside, so don't worry.

395
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,589
You have bleeding
in your abdomen right now,

396
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,059
so we need to take a CT scan first.

397
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,119
Please! Please...

398
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:09,789
call the police.

399
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,630
Ma'am?

400
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,400
Her vitals are dropping.

401
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
What's going on?

402
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,440
She lost consciousness
while talking.

403
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,809
And her vitals?

404
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,170
80 over 40, 110 beats.

405
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,509
Let me check the sonography again.

406
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,410
What's going on?

407
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,319
The rape victim has hemoperitoneum.

408
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,619
(Hemoperitoneum:
bleeding in the abdomen)

409
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,819
I can't see the origin point.

410
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,259
The location says spleen injury.

411
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,960
I know that!

412
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,690
Doctor, her vitals are dropping.

413
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,130
70 over 40, 130 beats.

414
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,960
She should head upstairs.
Get her ready.

415
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,630
Hey, I'm the lead surgeon
on this case.

416
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,539
You'll operate on her yourself?

417
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,470
What do you mean by that?

418
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,240
You let me handle these kinds
of trauma back at Geodae.

419
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,140
You never bothered especially
if things were remotely risky.

420
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,119
Get her some blood
and wheel her out.

421
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,920
Call Dr. Shim and prepare the OR.

422
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,089
I'll assist you then.

423
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,849
There's no one else anyway.

424
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,400
- Make the preparations.
- Sure.

425
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
Dr. Seo.

(Master Kim)

429
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,190
You'll lead surgery
even in the state you're in?

430
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,619
All right. May we begin?

431
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,660
Yes, we're ready.

432
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,130
Okay, scalpel.

433
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,660

Richardson retractor.

436
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,750
Pull slightly.

437
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,559
Bovie and gauze.

438
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:56,990
Retractor.

439
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,599
Keep the umbrella still.

440
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,970
Let's see.

441
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,200
It went through
his right middle lobe.

442
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,039
After removing the foreign body,

443
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,910
we'll perform
a right middle lobectomy.

444
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,509
Yes, Master Kim.

445

Bovie.

446
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,799
What are you doing out here?

447
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,470
I told you to prep the OR.

448
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,299
There's evidence on her body
that needs to be collected.

449
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,410
I'm done.

450
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,609
(For the Police,
Emergency Rape Kit)

451
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,660
Here you go.

452
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:01,289
This is the evidence
collected from Ms. Jung.

453
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,329
I hope this can lead to an arrest.

454
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,259
You did well.

455
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,400
Right, then...

456
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,329
Doctor, may I get a name?

457
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,500
It's Yun Ah Reum.

458
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,039
I see, Dr. Yun.

459
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,039
I'd like to ask you
about the victim.

460
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,440
Could you spare me some time?

461

Detective Go.

463
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,900
I'm sure things are hectic
due to the bus accident.

464
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,869
The storm already passed us...

465
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,640
and we're now taking a breather.

466
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,710
I received the call
about the rape victim,

467
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,680
but we were stuck in traffic...

468
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,180
because of the accident.

469
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Where's the victim?

470
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,549
She went into surgery
just a moment ago.

471
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,619
But the police officer
already came by earlier.

472
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,289
What? One of us came by already?

473
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,130
Were you informed of that?

474
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,630
No, I didn't receive any calls.

475
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,670
Which precinct
was this officer from?

476
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,440
I'm not sure.
It's not like we make note of that.

477
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,359
Okay, we've tied off
the blood vessels.

478
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,690
Shall we remove the umbrella then?

479

480
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,099

482
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Good. She's stable.

483
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,349
We'll now remove the foreign body.

484
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,549
Okay, we're ready too.

- Yes.

00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,710
It's all right.

494
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,780
Change of gloves.

495
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,289

496
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,800

00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,969
I need a visual on the spleen.

499
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,469
Okay, I see it.

500
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,139
Bovie.

501
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,079
Suction.

502
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,579
Right angle forceps.

503
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
Don't you need
to keep doing the dissection?

504
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,150
(Dissection: cutting apart
or separating tissue)

505
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,019
Are you the head surgeon?

506
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,059
The patient has
a long pancreas tail.

507
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,119
I'm only giving you
my opinion on the matter.

508
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,800
How dare you share your opinions
when a senior surgeon is operating?

509
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,000
Dr. Seo.

510
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,440
My apologies.

511
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:39,909
Right angle forceps.

512
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,679
Tie.

513
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,400
- Cut.
- Metzenbaum scissors.

514
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,159
Cut.

515
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,170
Bovie.

516
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,579
What's this?

517
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,550
- You didn't tie it off properly?
- Suction.

518
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,019
The accessory vessel
seems to be torn.

519
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,619
Accessory vessel, my foot.

520
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,219
You can barely manage a knot.

521
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,320
Vascular clamp.

522
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,489
What do you think you're doing?

523
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,760
The bleeding has stopped.

524
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,769
It wasn't the vessel I tied.

525
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,570
Don't just stand there.
Keep tying them off.

526
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,199
Tie.

527
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,550
- Cut.
- Cut.

528
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:53,849
What's this?

529
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,650
What's with the pancreas tail?

530
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,260
What on earth
did you do with the clamps?

531
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Vascular clamps can't cause
these kinds of injuries.

532
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,289
Are you saying it's my fault then?

533
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,190
It's why I suggested
you keep doing the dissection.

534
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,489
How dare you!

535
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,260
Stop it, you both.

536
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,769
What are you doing
when a patient's on the table?

537
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
- We'll call Master Kim.
- Forget it.

538
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,969
I'll finish this.

539
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,469
The pancreatic juice is leaking.

540
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,110
At this rate, her organs will melt.

541
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,480
I said I'll finish this.

542
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,010
Enough!

543
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,849
Call Master Kim in OR One.

544
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,550
Dr. Shim.

545
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,389
Will you be a stubborn jerk
and let her die then?

546
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,530
Call Master Kim
before things get worse.

547
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,730
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,869
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

549
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,139
OR Two is asking for you.

550
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,269
During a splenectomy,

551
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,969
the pancreas was torn.

552
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,809
Isn't Dr. Seo in OR Two?

553
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,809
Dr. Yang is leading the surgery.

554
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,719
Okay.

555
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,420
- Eun Jae.
- Yes?

556
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,519
I'm sure you can wrap up
the lobectomy procedure.

557
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,829
Of course, I can do it.

558
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,190
Leave this OR to me...

559
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,059
and save the poor creatures
in OR Two.

560
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,530
That's what I call improvement.

561
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,639
I can't believe
you told a joke in the OR.

562
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,409
I only have Master Kim's
prescription to thank.

563
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,780
Sorry.

564
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,019
I'm famished
whenever I step into the OR.

565
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,989
I guess that's way better
than vomiting, passing out,

566
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,659
or running away.

567
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,769
Ms. Oh.

568
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:53,099
You don't seem to be
in the best of condition today.

569
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,269
You're awfully quiet.

570
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,639
Do I?

571
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,880
Bovie, please.

572
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,840
Would you like some coffee?

573
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,480
Well, my stomach's
been acting up lately.

574
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,179
I see, then...

575
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,889
Since you're offering, I'll say yes.

576
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,360
What would you like?
Instant coffee or ground coffee?

577
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,389
We also have
a vending machine outside.

578
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
Take a guess.

579
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,630
Which do you think I'd prefer?

580
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,039
I'm not sure.

581
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,380
This.

582
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,920
Please call the police.

583
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,630
Right.

584
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,179
I see you figured it out.

585
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,760
What are you saying?

586
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,500
A police officer
answered to a rape case,

587
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,800
but he's not the actual police?

588
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,699
Who is this person then?

589
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,429
That's what we're checking.

590
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,739
None of the nearby precincts...

591
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,269
sent any officers here.

592
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,139
None of the district stations
did either.

593
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,239
What? Oh, no.

594
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,550
No wonder.
He got here awfully quick.

595
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Excuse me.

596
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,289
Do you have a patient
named Jung Ga Young?

597
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,619
That was incredibly fast.
We called you five minutes ago.

598
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,019
I was patrolling nearby...

599
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,690
when I received the call
on my radio.

600
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,730
Where is she?

601
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,630
Who is the doctor
that talked to the police?

602
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,429
Dr. Yun.

603
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,400
Where is she right now?

604
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,000
Mr. Park is looking for her.

605
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,840
She won't answer any of our calls,
and we can't find her anywhere.

606
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,969
What?

607
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,750
(Men's dressing room,
Women's dressing room)

608
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,679
Dr. Yun, are you in there?

609
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,090
Is no one inside?

610
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:07,800
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

611
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,670
Women are so easy to trick.

612
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,769
Once you wear a cop's uniform,
they just easily believe you...

613
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,639
and lower their guards.

614
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,179
You're not a cop?

615
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,110
This uniform?

616
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:27,550
No, I stole this, you fool.

617
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,889
By the way, will Jung Ga Young
be able to live...

618
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,659
once she gets surgery?

619
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,460
Of course.

620
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,969
Our best surgeons
are performing surgery on her.

621
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,469
Oh, I see.

622
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,139
That's not good.

623
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:57,610
Anyway, thanks for the gift.

624
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Thanks to you,
the evidence will be gone.

625
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,619
I know, right?

626
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,219
- Be careful.
- What?

627
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,260
Come here!

628
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,300
- Dr. Yun.
- Hey!

629
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,730
- Mr. Park.
- Hey!

630
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,900
Come over here! Come here!

631
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,510
Darn it.

632
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
Sir!

633
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:08,219
Are you okay?

634
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,900
I'll take over the surgery.

635
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,010
What happened to the pancreas tail?

636
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,780
This patient has a spleen injury.

637
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,519
She has a long pancreas tail,

638
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,179
but it got damaged while we were
trying to tie off the vessels.

639
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,889
And her pancreatic juice
is constantly leaking.

640
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,090
Okay.

641
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,489
I'm going to do
a distal pancreatectomy.

642
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:50,590
(Distal pancreatectomy:
Removing the tail of the pancreas)

643
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,659
Sponge stick.

644
00:44:58,869 --> 00:44:59,869
I'm sorry.

645
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,280
Carpal tunnel syndrome.

646
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,219
Wrist pains, numbness in your hands
and hypoesthesia.

647
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,360
And weakness in your thumb muscle.

648
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,260
What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

649
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,559
No.

650
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:28,900
I got a cramp on my hand.

651
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,199
But that's not what I saw that day.

652
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,809
Maybe I was really mistaken...

653
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,409
about his elbow.

654
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,190
Aren't you going to do the surgery?

655
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,690
Master Kim.

656
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,469
Okay, I'm ready.

657
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,099
I'm okay now.

658
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,170
Let's begin.

659
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,380
Bovie.

660
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,389
It looked a lot more serious
than expected.

661
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,489
He couldn't move his hand
for quite a long time.

662
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,130
I think he'll have to receive
wrist surgery as soon as possible.

663
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,369
So what happened to the surgery?

664
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,469
Pardon?

665
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:42,769
Well, I think it's going well.

666
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,539
Including the others
who had a penetrating wound...

667
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:46,280
and crush syndrome?

668
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,340
Yes.

669
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,280
They all seem to be
doing okay as well.

670
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,219
But why do you ask?

671
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,860
So he ended up saving them both?

672
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,489
Pardon?

673
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,210
What was I expecting?

674
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,679
Did I expect him to be wrong?

675
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,909
Was I hoping
that someone would die?

676
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,960
(Doldam Hospital)

677
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,199
Thank you, everyone.

678
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,639
We didn't do much.

679
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,579
Dr. Yun and Mr. Park
did most of the job.

680
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,679
Mr. Koo helped us wrap things up.

681
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:00,550
I was just passing by.

682
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,619
- Here.
- Oh, okay.

683
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,949
We did a few tests on the victim.

684
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,519
Please use this to make sure
that punk rots in jail.

685
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,690
I hope he gets sentenced
for a really long time.

686
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:15,099
We'd love to do that,
but the judge is in charge...

687
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,400
of sentencing him.

688
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,800
Anyway, thank you, everyone.

689
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,539
- Thank you too.
- Bye.

690
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,840
Make some space. Move.

691
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:26,610
You little...

692
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,690
(Doldam Hospital)

693
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,119
Tonight...

694
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,619
was a very long night like always.
Don't you agree?

695
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,989
It's cold. We should go inside.

696
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:49,030
Yes, I guess we should.

697
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,070
We should go too.

698
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,940
I like that you're brave,
but please don't be reckless.

699
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:06,150
You were more reckless than I was.

700
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,190
I thought you had wings.

701
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:12,349
How could you fly so high?

702
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:17,760
I learned taekwondo
when I was little.

703
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,199
You see,

704
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,199
I'm really glad
I came to Doldam Hospital.

705
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,769
Someone told me
that if I come here,

706
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,880
I'll be able to feel alive
every single day.

707
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,449
There really is a variety
of incidents and patients here.

708
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,820
And there are lots of good people.

709
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,989
Who told you that?

710
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,590
Just someone who's really cranky.

711
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:54,929
It's cold.

712
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,469
Someone cranky?

713
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,070
Who could that be?

714
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,989
(Yun Ah Reum)

715
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,610
The chairman's office
is really one of a kind.

716
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:41,539
Every single corner of this room
is so fancy, President Do.

717
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:46,920
I can't believe myself.

718
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,150
I'm still a little drunk,
Chairman Do.

719
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,329
This must be Mirae Hospital,
the project you mentioned earlier.

720
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,929
My goodness.

721
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,969
The project is a lot bigger
than I imagined.

722
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,539
I'm the chairman now,
so I should keep things big.

723
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,409
So...

724
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,739
do you plan to appoint Dr. Park...

725
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,710
as the president of Mirae Hospital?

726
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,719
I'm still thinking about it.

727
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:24,289
I can't seem to get a grasp
of what he's thinking.

728
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,889
That's just how he is.

729
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,090
This is such a huge project.

730
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,530
I'm not sure if someone
like Dr. Park can handle it.

731
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,630
Don't get the wrong idea.

732
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,570
You keep your position
as the center head safe.

733
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,900
You bet I will.

734
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,440
When did I start getting ideas?

735
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,550
But still,

736
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:54,949
I do feel a bit upset.

737
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,119
To think you considered...

738
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,320
Dr. Park for that
flashy position before me.

739
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,789
That's because Dr. Park is
a very popular surgeon.

740
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,960
He has great skills.

741
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,829
You must admit that.

742
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,269
I do.

743
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,570
I do admit that.

744
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,659
Is it fun?

745
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,230
Showing off as you belittle others.

746
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,440
Do you enjoy it?

747
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,739
Do you treat people
for fun, Dr. Park?

748
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,809
Do you wear...

749
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:55,380
your doctor gown to show off?

750
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,309
I wanted to be a better person.

751
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,949
That's why I became a doctor,

752
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,650
and while I'm wearing my gown...

753
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:05,690
Yes.

754
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,619
I thought I deserve to
show off a bit.

755
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,960
Then keep living the life you did.

756
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,230
Why are you picking on me?

757
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:17,199
That accident 11 years ago.

758
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,639
Ever since that accident,

759
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,570
I spent every night...

760
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,139
trying to run away from that bus.

761
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,210
Then the moment
I saw you again, I realized...

762
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,880
what I was running away from...

763
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,079
wasn't the accident.

764
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,690
It was you.

765
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,090
What are you talking about now?

766
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,690
Why are you feigning ignorance?

767
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,860
In that bus that night!

768
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,969
You stayed behind...

769
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,170
and I ran away.

770
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,039
That's why you continue to mock me.

771
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,510
When?

772
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,380
The tension pneumothorax!

773
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,780
(Pneumothorax: Air trapped
in the pleural cavity.)

774
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,550
From the moment
you sent that note until now.

775
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,059
I bet that even now
you're mocking me inwardly.

776
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,030
That's why you brag
even more in front of me.

777
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,000
"Can you save him?"

778
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:25,829
That's what you should ask.

779
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,539
You criticize me!

780
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:29,940
You don't want to
get yourself dirty.

781
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,769
That's why you shy away.

782
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,039
You belittle me!

783
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,539
Oops. He made it.

784
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,210
You push me until...

785
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,250
I feel ashamed and embarrassed.

786
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,050
You think I'm a fake.

787
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:47,559
A coward who ran off
to save himself...

788
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,489
calls himself a doctor.

789
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,690
Isn't that it?

790
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,969
Now I finally get the picture.

791
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,869
Why someone so haughty...

792
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:03,239
also seemed
so inferior and defeated.

793
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,739
Too bad.

794
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,139
I don't remember you.

795
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:17,719
I found out that you were
also on that bus 11 years ago...

796
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,219
through a news article

797
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,260
But that's it.

798
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,889
Whether you were...

799
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,860
hurt that night...

800
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,929
or whether you ran away or not.

801
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,599
I have no idea.

802
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,639
Are you determined to
make me a punk?

803
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,010
If you're willing to
do that to yourself,

804
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,579
then I won't stop you,

805
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,849
but let me tell you one thing.

806
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,449
That accident wasn't your fault...

807
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,190
or your responsibility.

808
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:52,690
It was dismal and terrifying,

809
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,090
and the bus could've
caught fire at any time.

810
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:01,730
In that madness,
you ran away to save yourself.

811
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,800
Who could criticize you for that?

812
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,800
No one can.

813
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,800
And shouldn't.

814
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,210
So...

815
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
it's time that you...

816
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,260
get off that bus.

817
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,150
I'll follow up on
the ABGA in 10 minutes.

818
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,409
Okay, doctor.

819
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,389
Check the hemovac drain often.

820
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:39,530
Yes, doctor.

821
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,409
The nausea. Is it completely gone?

822
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,210
Thanks to Master Kim,
I rule the OR now.

823
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,550
I'm slaying it.

824
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,750
To be honest, when
I was forced to come here,

825
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,789
I thought my life was over.

826
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:12,460
For me as well,

827
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:15,260
this is the place I ended up at...

828
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,570
when I was cornered.

829
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,070
But now...

830
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,440
it's fun.

831
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,679
I want to be a doctor here
for longer.

832
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,949
They don't have that problem here.

833
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,250
You don't have to appease anyone...

834
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,789
and don't have to wonder
who to side with to succeed.

835
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,889
Even if Ho Jun glares at me
and wants me gone,

836
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:42,159
I can fight back.

837
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:43,389
Yes.

838
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:46,289
That's impossible back at Geodae.

839
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,659
There, everyone takes sides,

840
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,670
and you need connections.

841
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,539
But here, there's no time to
even think about that.

842
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,909
Patients just keep coming in.

843
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,280
It's easier to focus on them.

844
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:04,309
That's how it should be like.

845
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,710
These days, it's hard to...

846
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,019
keep things how they should be.

847
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,949
It's all thanks to Master Kim.

848
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:13,550
Isn't it?

849
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,860
To be honest, at first,

850
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,360
I thought he was
a close-minded cranky old man.

851
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,659
He's actually
an open-minded old man.

852
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,530
A legendary open-minded old man.

853
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,969
He's my type.

854
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,940
Earlier on, he took my side...

855
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,639
against Dr. Park.

856
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,639
He didn't take your side.
He took the patient's.

857
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,050
Either way, it felt great.
So thrilling.

858
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,250
Thanks to him, I survived,

859
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,550
and so did he.

860
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,989
After my first surgery here,

861
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:52,789
he said something.

862
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,400
What?

863
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,300
"Save them."

864
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,900
"Save them, whatever it takes."

865
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,739
That's cool.

866
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:05,570
What now?

867
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,940
What if I lose my mind...

868
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,840
and want to stay here forever?

869
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,110
I'll become a fossil here...

870
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,309
and work with him forever.

871
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,349
Shall we...

872
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,320
really do that?

873
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,460
You want to stay here too?

874
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,489
What? You don't like it?

875
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,960
Well, that's totally up to you.

876
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,099
Why care if I like it or not?

877
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,699
Stay if you want to. Don't mind me.

878
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,670
Don't worry. I won't cross the line.

879
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,940
What? I didn't say anything.

880
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,480
I'm starving.

881
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,380
Shall we have cup noodles?

882
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,320
No.

883
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,820
I don't eat carbs after 6pm.

884
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,769
That's odd.

885
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:05,769
I don't usually get this hungry.

886
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:34,960
(Milk)

887
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:53,710
(Doctor's Office)

888
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,699
Darn.

889
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:18,739
Master Kim, are you in here?

890
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,539
Sir?

891
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,090
Sir?

892
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,690
Master Kim.

893
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,389
Sir.

894
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,260
Sir!

895
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,659
Master Kim.

896
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,030
Master Kim!

897
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,300
Sir?

898
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,809
I need sutures, antibiotics,

899
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:55,179
- and some elastic bandage.
- Yes, doctor.

900
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:57,750
Do we have another patient?

901
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:01,820
No, not exactly.

902
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,320
What you just ordered
is for a laceration.

903
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:07,320
Who's the patient?

904
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,059
Well, you see...

905
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,389
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

906
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,400
Let me come with you.

907
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:17,099
You'll need assistance anyway.

908
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,670
I'm sure I can manage on my own.

909
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:22,269
Where is...

910
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,539
the patient right now?

911
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:27,309
- Ms. Oh...
- I asked you...

912
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,039
where the patient is.

913
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:35,519
The phone's ringing, Ms. Oh.

914
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,449
This is the ER.

915
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,099
Here!

916
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,320
Master Kim? Sir!

917
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:14,889
Dr. Seo.

918
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,460
- Be careful.
- Okay, 1, 2, 3.

919
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,559
Master Kim?

920
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,199
Master Kim!

921
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:26,869
Please wake up.

922
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:28,800
Master Kim?

923
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,440
Master Kim, please wake up.

924
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,650
Master Kim? Master Kim!

925
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,280
(Dr. Romantic 2)

926
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,519
So this is where you've been hiding.

927
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,659
Hey, Woo Jin.

928
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:21,989
Look at you.

929
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:23,719
You haven't changed a bit.

930
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,630
What? Who collapsed?

931
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,130
Master Kim, are you all right?

932
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,059
What if we're the reason
why Master Kim collapsed?

933
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,699
A letter of dismissal?

934
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:36,639
What's Boo Yong Joo's condition?

935
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,510
What is it?
Is something wrong, Dr. Seo?

936
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:41,610
No one should make
the same mistake twice.

937
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,780
Without Master Kim,
Doldam Hospital will not exist.
