00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,649
Hi, there, Woo Jin.

3
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,719
Here you are.

4
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,090
Do you know what hoops
we went through to find you?

5
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,060
We were wondering
where you ran off to.

6
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,460
Who knew it was to
somewhere this remote?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Is this place really a hospital?

8
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,700
We should take this outside.

9
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,969
So that you can run?

10
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,379
Let's take this outside.

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,659
(Hope, Love, Service)

12
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,060
- Ma'am, how much is all this?
- Hold on.

13
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,230
This time,

14
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,060
you were rash, sir.

15
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,799
It didn't occur to me
that your team...

16
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,599
would make such a mistake.

17
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,039
Although, it's nothing to
beat yourself up over.

18
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,509
Just consider it
as a practice round.

19
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,539
I don't follow, sir.

20
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,650
This is the hospital...

21
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,919
that'll be constructed next year.

22
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,819
It looks like a high-end resort.

23
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,960
Exactly.

24
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,789
There's going to be a nine hole
golf course beside the lake.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,729
A golf course in a hospital?

26
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,300
A stem cell research center
that focuses on bionomics,

27
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,870
a spa, and health care.

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,870
I also plan to build
some additional facilities...

29
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,409
where people can shop
and enjoy their free time.

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,539
And 30 minutes away
from the hospital,

31
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,710
there will be a casino.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,310
A place that not only
takes care of your health...

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,250
but also allows you to enjoy
your hobbies and relax.

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,550
That will be the main strength
of our hospital.

35
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,990
I don't...

36
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,120
really understand.

37
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,259
People who are sick and injured...

38
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,490
can no longer bring us profit.

39
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,400
People who can spend money on
maintaining their health and youth.

40
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,500
And a hospital that provides
the best quality service...

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,800
for those kinds of customers.

42
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,139
That will be the core business
of Geodae Foundation in the future.

43
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,639
(A world of cost-effectiveness)

44
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,750
A world of cost-effectiveness.

45
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,849
This is 10,000 dollars.

46
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,689
Woo Jin, are you kidding me?

47
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,930
How are you going to pay back
70,000 dollars at this rate?

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
Why is it suddenly 70,000 dollars?

49
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,500
I already paid back 10,000,
so I owe you 40,000 dollars.

50
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,699
What about the interest?

51
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,340
The money...

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,270
I gave you guys in total...

53
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,310
already exceeds the principal.

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,580
Exactly.

55
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,710
So don't try to work your way
out of this debt.

56
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,180
Just be a man...

57
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,419
and do as we say.

58
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,419
Then you'll finally be free of debt.

59
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,289
What he's offering you
is a lot more cost-effective.

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,330
A world where all relationships...

61
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,000
are judged based on
efficiency and profit.

62
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,970
It's time for things to change.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
The medical fees are
unbelievably low.

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,110
There's too much competition
among the hospitals.

65
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,139
And even if you save a dying person
with CPR,

66
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,610
they sue you
for fracturing their ribs.

67
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,709
Responsibility and obligation...

68
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,910
have turned into
an unreasonable sacrifice.

69
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:39,579
People these days curse doctors
and grab us by our collars.

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,990
Why do people force responsibility
and self-sacrifice to only doctors?

71
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,889
Don't you think that's unfair?

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,089
And these days, people even weigh...

73
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,029
the benefits and losses
of public interest and goodwill.

74
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,230
So...

75
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,300
what's your point?

76
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,240
The world has no respect for us.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,769
So we must find a way to survive.

78
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,509
We must do so
with dignity and class.

79
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,379
What do you say?

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,949
What do you say?

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,519
Are you willing to call it even?

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you willing to join me?

83

Hey, Dr. Yun.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,339
Good morning.

93
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,470
Sir.

94
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,339
- Good morning, sir.
- Yes.

95
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,180
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning.

96
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,420
Good morning to you too, sir.

He likes someone.

98
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,939
What? Who?

99
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,779
Mr. Park.

100
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,579
Mr. Park?

101
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:49,149
There was a doctor named
Woo Yeon Hwa who used to work here.

102
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,519
And apparently, he liked her.

103
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,379
It's been a year since she left,
but he still isn't over her.

104
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,920
I see.

105
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,360
But why are you telling me this?

106
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,420
I just thought you should know.

107
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,959
What was that?

108
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,439
What? What are you talking about?

109
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,470
You sent him a letter of dismissal?

110
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,939
(Letter of Dismissal
Name: Yeo Woon Young)

111
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,810
(You have been dismissed
for the reasons mentioned above.)

(Chairman Do Yun Wan)

113
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,420
What? A letter of dismissal?

114
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,490
People will hear you.

115
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,500
Let's go to Master Kim's office.

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,550
What do you mean?

117
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,620
President Yeo got dismissed?
Who told you that?

118
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,449
I just got a call
from the foundation.

119
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,790
It looks like the board already
made their decision last week.

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,759
I can't believe Yun Wan...

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,800
is even messing
with President Yeo now.

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,160
This is absurd.

123
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,230
But there's something
even more absurd.

124
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,399
There's more?

125
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,509
I heard rumors saying
Dr. Park Min Guk is going to be...

126
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,310
the succeeding president
of our hospital.

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,310
What?

128
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,629
What? Dr. Park Min Guk is going
to be this hospital's president?

129
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,899
Yes, apparently.

130
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,070
Who told you that?

131
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,399
Did Dr. Park tell you that himself?

132
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,700
Manager Jang.

133
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,940
According to him, it's already been
decided by the board.

134
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,480
But what's that supposed to mean?

135
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,509
Is it a promotion or demotion?

136
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,009
That's what I'm not sure about.

137
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,179
It looks like he's taking the blame
for what happened with the minister.

138
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,820
But then again, he's becoming
the hospital president,

139
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,990
so that might not be the case.

140
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,990
Then what about us?
Do we need to stay here?

141
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
No.

142
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,730
I can't abide by
something so ridiculous.

143
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,139
The board of directors
has full authority...

144
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,509
over whom to appoint
as the hospital president.

145
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,139
That's exactly why Yun Wan
had to step down three years ago.

146
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,980
But President Yeo is different.

147
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,210
Yun Wan was the president
of the main hospital,

148
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,820
and he did things
for his own benefit.

149
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,120
But when President Yeo got here,

150
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,259
this was just an unknown hospital
in the countryside.

151
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,029
He barely managed to come this far.

152
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,129
This place was practically run-down,

153
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,570
but it's finally starting to look
like a proper hospital.

154
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,269
And now, they suddenly
choose to appoint...

155
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,600
a new president to their own liking?

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,710
Dr. Park Min Guk of all people?

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,980
Have they gone crazy?
How could they do this?

158
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,409
Calm down.

159
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,980
Nothing is for sure yet.
It's just a rumor.

160
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,250
I don't care.

161
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,750
I can't accept this decision.

162
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,159
We should gather a group
and go on a strike...

163
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,960
to show them what we think.

164
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,159
If we do that,
it will make Chairman Do...

165
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,929
extremely happy.

166
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,870
And in the end,
President Yeo will have to deal...

167
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,740
with the consequences.

168
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,340
You know that, Ms. Oh.

169
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,049
I'll talk to President Yeo myself.

170
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,419
You're going to protect him, right?

171
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,320
President Yeo.

172
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,419
You're going to protect him, right?

173
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,679
How much is his urine output?

174
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,279
About 40cc every hour.

175
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,019
That's good.

176
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,250
If he feels pain,
give him an IV injection...

177
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,889
- and call me.
- Okay.

178
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,600
What are you doing this weekend?

179
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,100
- Why?
- Just wondering.

180
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,840
Why do you want to know?

181
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,769
It's our first weekend
after we came here.

182
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,580
We don't know anyone here.

183
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,149
And I was wondering if there's
anything interesting to do nearby.

184
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,080
You won't have time to go anywhere.

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,990
Why? Did something happen
at the hospital?

186
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,320
Today is Friday.

187
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,200
- What are you doing?
- I'm stretching.

188
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,669
Why are you suddenly stretching?

189
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,809
Because today is Friday.

190
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,779
- It has begun.
- What?

191
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,720
It has begun.

192
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,039
Relax! Relax!

193
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,210
Relax. Calm down. Relax.

194
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,610
They're Russians
who perform at the casino.

195
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,750
Their minibus...

196
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,049
rolled over when the driver
swerved to avoid a deer.

197
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,879
Five have simple lacerations.

198
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,049
One with glass in her face,

199
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,519
and one with a fractured hip
are in the hybrid room.

200
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,860
Isn't this a countryside hospital?

201
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,730
1 freeway and 4 national
highways pass through,

202
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,629
and there's a casino
30 minutes away.

203
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,370
50,000 people visit each weekend.

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,370
- Dr. Bae!
- I'm coming.

205
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,799
- Dr. Seo.
- Okay.

206
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:25,809
No way.

207
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,509
I'm a cardiac surgeon.

208
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,250
I'm... I'm CS. You know?

209
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,720
CS, okay, very good.

210
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,289
- What's the problem?
- You must find...

211
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,659
Heart, lung, and rib.

212
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,720
Ensemble.

213
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,929
Dancer. They dance. Dance.

214
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,799
What's he saying?

215
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,970
Doctor! Doctor!

216
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,370
Is there a doctor? Doctor.

217
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,269
- Help us. My kid's sick.
- Come this way.

218
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,440
My gosh.

219
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,490
Don't move.

220
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,330
You can't move.

221
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,870
Oh. No, no, no. No, no, no.

222
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,279
You can't smoke in a hospital, okay?

223
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,080
No smoking. Okay?

224
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,720
Let me see.
Hang in there just a bit.

225
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,220
Oh, you're doing so well.

226
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,350
One more.

227
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,690
Will you lie down?

228
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,029
I'm okay.

229
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,159
I am fine. I'm okay.

230
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,730
Not okay. Will you keep still?

231
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,129
What's the matter?

232
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,399
He's a traffic accident patient.

233
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,799
I think he fractured
his right knee and hip,

234
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,840
but he's refusing treatment.

235
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,080
A hip fracture must hurt like crazy.

236
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,950
He doesn't seem to be in any pain.

237
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,980
Have a look.

238
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,259
Don't. Don't touch me.

239
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,159
Just go away!

240
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,090
Come here.

241
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,000
It's that, don't you think?

242
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,330
I think so.

243
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,700
An injection mark, dilated pupils,

244
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,769
no pain.

245
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,200
Aren't our hands tied
if he refuses treatment?

246
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,970
If he did drugs
and is hallucinating,

247
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,809
it's the same as mentally unstable.

248
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,470
He can't make rational decisions.

249
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:55,929
Here you go.

250
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,669
Don't mind the board of
directors' decision.

251
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,370
Your decision is
more important to us.

252
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,870
And if needed,

253
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,139
I'll see Do Yun Wan myself.

254
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,750
Don't cause an unnecessary fuss,
Master Kim.

255
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,220
I have to leave soon anyway.

256
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,690
That's why I came back.

257
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,639
They're taking a while.

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,409
It's not an easy topic to discuss.

259
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,019
You should get to work.

260
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,990
I'll call you when
Master Kim returns.

261
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,629
- Don't bite. Don't bite.
- Let go.

262
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:04,859
Mister?

263
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,410
What happened here?

264
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,980
Hip fracture due to
a traffic accident.

265
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,579
I think he's on something.

266
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,619
Dr. Seo, don't just lie there.
Get him!

267
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,849
Leave it.

268
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,319
Mr. Koo!

269
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,589
Mr. Koo!

270
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,859
Yes, Ms. Oh.

271
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,359
- Get him in a bed.
- Of course.

272
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,269
Be careful. He fractured his hip.

273
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,240
Don't touch me, you!

274
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,839
Ms. Uhm!

275
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,420
Don't touch me! Get off!

276
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,049
Get me some Ativan.

277
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,049
Send in an OP lab,

278
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,460
and give him a liter of
normal saline.

279
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,859
When sending in the OP lab,
screen for drugs too.

280
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,990
Yes, doctor.

281
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,059
Patient coming in!

282
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,599
Suspected drug poisoning.

283
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,230
We got a call that
kids were unconscious.

284
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,269
When we arrived,
one was already dead.

285
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,740
This one responds to pain.

286
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
BP 70 over 40,
the heart rate is at 30.

287
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,210
To the hybrid room.

288
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,609
Dr. Jung. Suspected drug poisoning.

289
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,980
This way.

290
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,279
I'm almost done here.

291
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,880
- Go and help them.
- Okay.

292
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,380
- Let's move him.
- Okay.

293
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,079
- 1, 2, 3.
- 3.

294
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,420
- Hold this.
- How is she?

295
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,160
Her mother found her.

296
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,660
She couldn't reach their dad,

297
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,859
and the door was locked,
so the police broke in.

298
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,190
The kids were unconscious,

299
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,559
and a lot of pill bottles
were in the trash.

300
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,599
The dad was found outside,
fallen down.

301
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,730
(Fall down: Fallen from a height.)

302
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,200
Was it a group suicide attempt?

303
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,710
We think so.

304
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,269
This is what we found at the scene.

305
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,410
The boy who seemed younger
already showed lividity,

306
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,880
so we let the police take over
without CPR.

307
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,819
Let's intubate first.

308
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,640
70 over 40, the heart rate is
between 30 and 35.

309
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Woo Jin. Woo Jin!

310
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,450
Woo Jin.

311
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,960
Woo Jin. No! Woo Jin!

312
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,329
What happened?

313
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,759
Woo Jin.

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,460
Wake up.

315
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,599
Don't die.

316
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,470
Do something. Woo Jin!

317
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,940
Ma'am, wait outside.

318
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,670
Save my son!

319
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,109
- Ma'am.
- Woo Jin!

320
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,309
Dr. Seo!

321
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,349
Dr. Seo!

322
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,549
Doctor. Is my Soo Jin okay?

323
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,759
Wait outside.

324
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,759
Ma'am.

325
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,829
Soo Jin, wake up. Mom's here!

326
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,460
Soo Jin!

327
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,700
- Mom's here! Soo Jin!
- Ma'am.

328
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,470
Soo Jin!

329
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,170
If you got the peripheral IV ready,
insert it to the side.

330
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,569
I'll give her dopamine.

331
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,609
Mix 500 with 5DW and give it
at 10cc per hour.

332
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,710
Just a moment.

333
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,390
Doctor, please save my daughter.

334
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,569
The dad who had fallen
will arrive soon.

335
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,009
Mr. Park.

336
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,180
- Check the prescription for this.
- Okay.

337
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,690
A deer jumped right in front of us.

338
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,190
What? A deer?

339
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,960
Yes. You know
what that road is like.

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,930
It curves around like this.

341
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,099
Okay.

342
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,700
I was driving...

343
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,809
(Emergency Medical Center)

344
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,349
I heard an amusing rumor.

345
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,559
That you plan to come here.

346
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,559
Word travels fast.

347
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,230
I got the offer
but haven't decided yet.

348
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,730
If you'd come to this rundown place,
we'd be grateful.

349
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,539
I'm just not sure if you'll like it.

350
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,509
It looks like this,

351
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,140
but this is a hospital
for trauma patients.

352
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,950
80 to 90 percent of those
we operate on...

353
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,150
are hurt at work
or in traffic accidents.

354
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,349
Workers at the apartment complex
that's under construction,

355
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,890
and foreign labor workers
at factories.

356
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,390
Don't forget
the intoxicated thugs...

357
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,930
who were beaten up in a brawl.
The list goes on.

358
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:45,099
So, will you be able to handle it?

359
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,710
Are you trying to scare me away?

360
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,640
Did it work?

361
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,349
Well, it looks like
things are quite busy.

362
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,900
You see,
today is Friday of all days.

363
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,299
We lack in personnel and resources,

364
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,869
but patients just keep flooding in.

365
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,940
Every Friday,

366
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,009
things are absolutely chaotic here.

367
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,480
This hospital is only for those who
are resilient and mentally strong.

368
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:35,849
So,

369
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,119
are you sure
you'll be able to handle it?

370
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,569
Who do we have?

371
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,170
A 15-year-old female
with drug poisoning.

372
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,970
It looks like the father tried to
kill himself and his whole family.

373
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,470
Did we identify the drug?

374
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,710
The result just came back. It's CCB.

375
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,180
He was prescribed a month's dosage
of nifedipine two weeks ago.

376
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,509
Vitals are at 80 over 40
and the heart rate is at 40.

377
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,950
Dr. Jung, insert an L-tube...

378
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,390
and attach a charcoal filter.

379
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,990
- Sure.
- Hand me your stethoscope.

380
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,230
- What's her BST?
- 140.

381
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,299
I want 50 units of RI on the side.

382
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,829
That much?

383
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,440
Yes, mix the 50 units
with normal saline.

384
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,769
Let it drip 10cc for an hour...

385
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,410
and drop the level to 5cc.

386
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,609
Is it safe to give her
that much insulin?

387
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,279
It's a high dose insulin therapy
used to treat CCB overdose.

388
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,849
Set her with the IV drip and
follow up on her every 20 minutes.

389
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,789
- Got it?
- Yes, Master Kim.

390
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,619
Did you talk to President Yeo?

391
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,329
We'll talk later.

392
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,529
Incoming!

393
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,339
You scum!

394
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,839
You piece of trash.

395
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,880
How can a human be this cruel?

396
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,710
I don't care how hard life is.
You don't kill your own kids.

397
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,509
- Ma'am, not here.
- Please calm down.

398
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,920
You monster.

399
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,779
What did our kids ever do wrong?

400
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,319
What have you done
to our Seung Chan?

401
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,619
- Please take her.
- Yes, Master Kim.

402
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,190
What happened?

403
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,660
He fell down from five stories.
He was caught on a branch...

404
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,559
and is now experiencing
severe abdominal pain.

405
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,859
Let's take him to the hybrid room.

406
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,869
Sure.

407
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,970
Just let him die.

408
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,839
He jumped to kill himself,

409
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,109
- so just let him die.
- Ma'am...

410
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,809
- Save my daughter first!
- Mr. Park.

411
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:37,839
Mr. Park!

412
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,009
- Save my daughter first.
- Ma'am, please.

413
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,380
Seung Chan!

414
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,250
Soo Jin, your mom's right here!

415
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,950
I'm right here, Soo Jin.

416
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,190
He's been that way for a while now.

417
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,730
Master Kim,

418
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,769
I have a five-year-old boy...

419
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,299
who seems to have taken
an entire bottle of Ibuprofen.

420
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,509
He's unresponsive
and his vitals are unstable.

421
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,710
Woo Jin.

422
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,779
Seo Woo Jin!

423
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,789
Check on the father.

424
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,289
I'll be right there.

425
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Dr. Seo.

426
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,069
He must've had a high fever
and nausea due to his cold.

427
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,170
Every time the boy
cried out in pain,

428
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,609
he was given
uncontrolled amounts of Ibuprofen.

429
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,480
Do an ABGA,

430
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,049
run an admission panel
including electrolyte levels.

431
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,250
Yes, Master Kim.

432
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,720
(A blood test to screen organs such
as one's liver, kidney, and others)

433
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,319
- Doctor.
- Yes?

434
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,450
What'll happen to our boy?

435
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,519
Anti-inflammatory drugs
such as Ibuprofen...

436
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,460
must be administered
at a controlled dosage.

437
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,960
If not, it could be lethal
for a young child.

438
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,930
- What?
- Due to the fever,

439
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,730
his organs weren't
already properly functioning.

440
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,940
The drug in his system...

441
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,900
may hinder his liver and kidneys
from properly functioning.

442
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,710
There's also a chance...

443
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,009
of internal bleeding in the stomach.

444
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,210
So what you're saying is that...

445
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,509
this stupid cow killed my boy?

446
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,480
Sir, your son is still alive.

447
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,819
You stupid cow!

448
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,619
- Sir, don't do this.
- You...

449
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,390
You can't even properly
look after a boy at home?

450
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,230
This is the best you can do?

451
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,599
- Sir...
- How dare you!

452
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,029
You idiot.

453
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,599
Sir, that's enough!

454
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:45,799
I could kill you...

455
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,970
Mr. Koo!

456
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,480
You...

457
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,450
Unbelievable.

458
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,650
Remove him from the emergency room.

459
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,720
You idiot!

460
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,519
Until I say otherwise,
he is not to enter.

461
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,160
Unbelievable.

462
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,130
Eun Jae, are you all right?

463
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,690
Yes, I'm fine, Master Kim.

464
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:13,630
Good.

465
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,700
Are you all right, ma'am?

466
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,240
Ma'am. Ma'am?

467
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,210
Gosh.

468
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,619
Master Kim, you're needed.

469
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,829
What are you doing?
Shouldn't you examine him?

470
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,400
Dr. Seo?

471
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,609
Does it hurt?

472
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,049
And here?

473
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,349
It hurts. Please be gentle.

474
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,289
How can you complain about the pain
when you tried to commit suicide?

475
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,230
- Dr. Seo!
- You will see...

476
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,500
what you have done.

477
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,140
Hold on.

478
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,720
Dr. Seo, what's wrong with you?

479
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,650
Why aren't you treating him?

480
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,849
He tried to kill himself.

481
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,359
I don't understand
why I should bother.

482
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,059
Are you kidding me?

483
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,430
Mr. Park.
Give him four liters of oxygen,

484
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,460
Make sure to set up IV lines,
and saline, please.

485
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,200
- You need warm saline?
- Yes, please.

486
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,029
Pick up the chest tube.

487
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,799
- No.
- Dr. Seo, what's gotten into you?

488
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,710
I'm sorry, but I can't treat him.

489
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,240
Hey!

490
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,150
Why can't you treat him?

491
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,279
Should he die then?

492
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,380
He already made up his mind to die.

493
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,289
What?

494
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,559
What did you just say?

495
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,799
Sir? Sir!

496
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,640
The patient isn't responding.

497
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,109
It's PEA!

498
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,910
Give him 1mg of epinephrine
every 3 minutes.

499
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,750
Defibrillator!

500
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,799
I can't breathe.

501
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,329
Please help.

502
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,160
Hey. Dr. Seo?

503
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,559
Where are you going?

504
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,599
I'll check for a rhythm.

505
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,569
We have a pulse.

506
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,380
His vitals are 80 over 40,
his heart-rate is at 100.

507
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,210
All right.

508
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,819
Time of death, November 4, 1:14am.

509
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,930
What are you doing here?

510
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,589
I told you that
this place is off limits.

511
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:13,460
I won't as long as you
give me an answer.

512
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,299
Stop dragging your feet
and make a decision.

513
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,099
We're not asking you
to kill a person,

514
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,299
so what's there to think about?

515
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,069
What if doing as you say...

516
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,170
costs me my medical license?

517
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,039
I doubt you'll care.

518
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,509
It's why the price
is 70,000 dollars.

519
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,950
How can it be fair...

520
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,450
if you're not willing to take
that much of a risk?

521
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,819
We'll do it tonight.

522
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,420
Meet us at 10pm.

523
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,619
Got it?

524
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,920
Dr. Seo.

525
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,640
- Who's that man?
- It's none of your business.

526
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,210
How do you know him?

527
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,549
Why do you want to know anyway?

528
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,380
He doesn't seem like a mobster.

529
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,880
Somewhere between
a thug and a gangster...

530
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,590
would be my guess.

531
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,650
Can you just...

532
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,920
Just let me be, all right?

533
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,460
I don't want any company right now.

534
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,829
Okay, fine. I won't care
since it's your business.

535
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,099
Still,

536
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,269
you can't leave
everyone hanging like this...

537
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,210
especially when
there's madness in the ER.

538
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,739
I'm not on the EM board.
There's no reason to be on standby.

539
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,340
Am I treating patients
because I'm on the EM board?

540
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,550
- Then don't.
- How can I do nothing...

541
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,420
when patients
are pouring into this tiny ER?

542
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,550
Since when has Doldam
become your biggest concern?

543
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,320
It's not the hospital
I'm worried about.

544
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,489
Then is this your way
of compensating for...

545
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,019
your inability to perform surgeries?

546
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,960
Right.

547
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,469
I should do this much
since I can't step into ORs.

548
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,769
It's how I can earn my keep, right?

549
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,539
Still, it's different.

550
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,039
I may not be able to,
but you're choosing not to.

551
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,719
I wonder which goes against
being a doctor more.

552
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,730
That petty jerk.

553
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,039
It's just impossible
to like the guy.

554
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,239
Where is he from anyway?

555
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,610
He's from another galaxy
far away from ours, right?

556
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,210
I could just kill you.

557
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,119
Both patients
are extremely unstable.

558
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,590
Who will you treat first?

559
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,690
One has bowel perforation
and hemoperitoneum.

560
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,500
His BP dropped and brought on a PEA.

561
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,630
He must be operated on immediately.

562
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,769
The patient
with the fractured hip...

563
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,900
doesn't have blood flowing
to the dorsalis pedis artery.

564
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,639
I ran
an extremity angiography,

565
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,539
and it revealed
a popliteal artery occlusion.

566
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,880
Without surgery,
we might have to amputate.

567
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:20,150
A femur neck fracture...

568
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,449
A femur neck fracture
when he is still young?

569
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,690
This is bad.

570
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,489
What should we do?
They both need immediate surgery.

571
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,429
We go with the higher-risk patient.

572
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:32,360
A femur neck fracture
will end up just losing a leg.

573
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,099
The patient's life isn't at risk.

574
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,780
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

575
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,519
Follow up on the female patient.

576
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,190
- You, Fourth Year.
- Yes?

577
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,460
Keep a good eye
on the Ibuprofen patient.

578
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
Yes, Master Kim.

579
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,119
How should I sort the ORs?

580
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,429
The bowel perforation
in Operation Room One...

581
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,699
and the femur neck fracture
in Operation Room Two.

582
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,460
You'll do both surgeries?

583
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,300
Dr. Bae, you'll take over
once I'm done with...

584
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,800
- the right popliteal artery bypass.
- Yes, Master Kim.

585
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,369
Mr. Park, have Dr. Seo meet me
outside OR One.

586
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,440
Yes, Master Kim.

587
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,309
Let's transfer the patients.

588
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,010
Sure. Dr. Jung.

589
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,679
Please call Dr. Yang
at Jungil Hospital.

590
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,949
Yes, Ms. Oh.

591
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,590
He's prepping both operation rooms.

592
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,869
The jumper and the patient
with the fractured hip...

593
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,469
will be operated on simultaneously.

594
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,710
Yes, come in.

595
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,699
Please drink this
let yourself ease up.

596
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,239
Hold on.

597
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,750
Did the boy's father do this to you?

598
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:43,789
You have some nerve
sitting there right now.

599
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,659
Look what you did to my boy.

600
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,230
Have you no shame? Gosh!

601
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,500
That's enough, sir.

602
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you want to be kicked out?

603
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,650
Wait, excuse me.

604
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,119
Can you keep an eye on them?

605
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,280
I'm afraid it looks like
a case of domestic abuse.

606
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,690
Sure.

607
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,190
Hey.

608
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,929
If anything happens to my boy,

609
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,530
I'll kill you.

610
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:22,900
Got it?

611
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,510
Dr. Seo, you're requested at OR One.

612
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,449
It's the man who jumped.

613
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,179
He has bowel perforation
and hemoperitoneum.

614
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:42,949
I said I wouldn't treat him.

615
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:44,320
He suffered a cardiac arrest.

616
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,420
His surgery can't
be delayed any longer.

617
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,289
I didn't become a doctor
to save people like him.

618
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,260
That shouldn't be your call to make.

619
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,030
Patients may choose their doctors,

620
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,699
but I learned that doctors can't.

621
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,340
No matter who they are,

622
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,010
what lives they lived,
and what crimes they committed,

623
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,510
those in the medical field
must not discriminate...

624
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,510
when it comes to patients.

625
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,519
- Are you lecturing me?
- No.

626
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:19,050
I want you to be ashamed
of yourself.

627
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:21,889
That's why I'm telling you this.

628
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,579
- You asked for me?
- Yes.

629
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,579
Have you ever done
an angiorrhaphy before?

630
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,119
No, I've only assisted
the procedure.

631
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,320
Come here.

632
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:55,019
He has a right femur neck fracture
and a knee joint ligament injury.

633
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:57,530
Before his orthopedic operation,

634
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,329
he needs to receive
a right popliteal artery bypass.

635
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,699
And I want you to assist.

636
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,670
But you told me not to enter the OR.

637
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,579
What's that?

638
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,019
This medicine will
calm your nausea in the OR.

639
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,250
I prepared this myself,

640
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,159
so it won't have any side effects,
and you won't get drowsy.

641
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,659
I'd love to give you more time,

642
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,260
but this is an emergency.

643
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,369
Come to OR Two
once you're done getting ready.

644
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:39,369
Okay?

645
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,659
He should've just died.

646
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,059
That would've been better for him.

647
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,530
He's just a kid.

648
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:16,170
How is he going to get by alone?

649
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,440
He should've just died as well.

650
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,349
He's off-duty?

651
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,650
Dr. Yang at Jungil Hospital
is off-duty both today and tomorrow.

652
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,820
I couldn't reach him either.

653
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,789
That leaves us with no choice.

654
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,590
We'll have to postpone surgery.
I'll tell Master Kim about this.

655
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,699
Wait.

656
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,070
What did you just say?

657
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,610
I asked you to prepare for surgery.

658
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:25,210
Do you know me?

659
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,239
Aren't you the anesthesiologist
from the main hospital?

660
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,710
My gosh, I don't think
you get what I mean.

661
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,380
I'm asking why you're asking me
to prepare for the surgery.

662
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:39,860
We have two patients that need
to receive emergency surgery.

663
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,289
The anesthesiologist who usually
helps us is off-duty today.

664
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:47,159
I know it's sudden, but we're
in an emergency. Please help.

665
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,730
No.

666
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,400
If they don't receive surgery,
their lives will be in danger.

667
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,969
Exactly.

668
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,869
I don't want to be responsible
for such dangerous surgery.

669
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,239
On top of that,
I don't even work here.

670
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
Are you serious?

671
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,420
You're really not going to help?

672
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,489
I'm sorry,
but I'm not a philanthropist.

673
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm not here to help anyone.

674
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,800
And you really shouldn't
ask strangers for help.

675
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,860
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

676
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,639
Dr. Shim.

677
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,150
Hey, Dr. Yang. What's up?

678
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,710
Dr. Park is looking for you.

679
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,090
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,820
I don't think we'll be able to do
both surgeries at the same time.

681
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,159
We'll have to choose
whom we're going to treat first.

682
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:03,210
Where's Woo Jin?

683
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:04,840
He isn't here yet.

684
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
What about Eun Jae?

685
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,150
She hasn't arrived yet either.

686
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,619
We can't lose any more time.

687
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,420
First, let's treat
the bowel perforation, Master Kim.

688
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,449
Okay.

689
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,860
Let's do that, Dr. Nam.

690
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,159
I'll get ready.

691
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,630
Master Kim.

692
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,530
Dr. Shim told me...

693
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,670
that you need an anesthesiologist.

694
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,510
Dr. Shim.

695
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,550
Let me see the patient first.

696
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,820
Come this way.

697
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,360
I thought you didn't believe
in showing goodwill...

698
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,000
without expecting
anything in return.

699
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,829
It's not exactly goodwill.

700
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,739
Now, it's more like an obligation.

701
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,179
This place isn't
as easy as it seems, Dr. Park.

702
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,150
There are so many different patients
with symptoms...

703
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,150
that are a lot more complex
than you can ever imagine.

704
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:01,219
When you're facing
a life and death situation,

705
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,460
your ego and sense of superiority
won't help at all.

706
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,860
Are you giving me advice?

707
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,670
I'm just telling you that you won't
be able to handle it...

708
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,599
if you have no sincerity
in working here.

709
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,539
I don't care about any of that.

710
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,940
I'm not even interested
in Doldam Hospital anyway.

711
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,750
I'm interested in Master Kim.

712
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,449
I finally found someone
I'd like to compete against.

713
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,489
So tell me.

714
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,690
Do you think you'll be able
to handle Master Kim?

715
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,630
Are you sure
you'll be able to handle it?

716
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,570
Boo Yong Joo...

717
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:49,300
might be harder to handle
than Doldam Hospital.

718
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,179
So, will you be able to handle it?

719
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,510
I'm willing...

720
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,179
to take my chances.

721
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,860
Don't be so stubborn
because of your pride.

722
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,659
You guys should just leave.

723
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,760
I don't know what kind of offer
you got from Yun Wan.

724
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,869
But everything he says
is pretty much nonsense.

725
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,670
So don't even bother looking
forward to it.

726
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:28,440
Chairman Do.

727
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,510
It's me, Park Min Guk.

728
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,849
Yesterday, you offered to appoint me
as the president of Doldam Hospital.

729
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:41,860
I'd like to accept that offer.

730
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,070
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

731
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,639
Master Kim.

732
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,539
What's going to happen
to President Yeo?

733
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,949
Is he really going to get dismissed?

734
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,219
Where are Woo Jin and Eun Jae?

735
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,420
I'll call Dr. Seo again.

736
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,949
I'll call Eun Jae as well.

737
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:45,019
No, don't.

738
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,920
We shouldn't push them too much.

739
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,030
Dr. Bae, you and I will have to
perform the surgery by ourselves...

740
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,400
I'm here!

741
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,599
I'm here, sir.

742
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,639
The patient is under anesthesia.

743
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,679
The patient is being put to sleep.

744
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,050
You both should get ready
for the femur neck fracture surgery.

745
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:14,820
- Okay, sir.
- Okay.

746
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,590
Master Kim.

747
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,690
Ms. Oh.

748
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,860
Let's focus on
what we must do right now.

749
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,429
The perforated bowel patient
and the popliteal artery patient.

750
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,000
Let's think only about those two.

751
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,699
Okay.

752
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,900
Dr. Seo is not answering.

753
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,449
I'm not here because
I want to save the patient.

754
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,820
To me,

755
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,190
he's still someone
I don't want to treat.

756
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,059
Then what?

757
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:02,630
Someone said that...

758
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,329
not doing something you can...

759
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,599
goes against being a doctor.

760
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,039
That I should be ashamed of myself.

761
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,340
If I'm to pay you back what I owe,

762
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,150
I must make myself worthwhile.

763
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,750
So I showed up.

764
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,449
Make yourself worthwhile.

765
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,250
Stop the bleeding for now.

766
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:26,690
I'll come over once I'm done with...

767
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,159
the popliteal artery patient.

768
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,989
Don't let the patient die.

769
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,090
Are you okay?

770
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,789
Are you speaking to me casually?

771
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,659
I remembered who you are.

772
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,699
The smart smurf
with delicate fingers.

773
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,800
Cha Eun Jae who enrolled in 2007.

774
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:15,469
You remembered at last.

775
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,570
Will you be okay operating today?

776
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,010
I should hope so.

777
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,050
I took the medicine
Master Kim gave me.

778
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,880
That medicine will be okay.

779
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,920
I've taken it before.

780
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,050
You too?

781
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,400
Relax.

782
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:46,539
It'll be fine.

783
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,909
Okay.

784
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,280
Can we begin?

785
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,849
His heart stopped once,

786
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,820
so his vitals are slightly unstable.

787
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,349
I'll hold him as long as I can,
so begin.

788
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,059
Scalpel.

789
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,230
A right femur neck fracture...

790
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,670
and knee joint ligament injury.

791
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,710
Today we'll do
a right popliteal artery bypass.

792
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,039
I marked the great saphenous vein.

793
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,050
The patient's vitals are not bad.

794
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,550
Thank you, Dr. Shim.

795
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,019
Runner.

796
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,949
Your vitals.

797
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:38,690
The heart rate is slightly elevated,

798
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:41,019
but it's still within
normal boundaries.

799
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,730
Okay then.

800
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,030
Let's get a graft first.

801
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,030
Scalpel.

802
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,239
Suction.

803
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,309
Gauze.

804
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,420
Suction.

805
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,869
Eun Jae!

806
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,409
Shall I do this?

807
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:34,909
I'll do it.

808
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,989
- Suction.
- Suction.

809
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:51,530
Right angle forceps.

810
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:58,400
(President Yeo Woon Young)

811
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:15,809
(Hope, Love, Service)

812
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,699
Hello.

813
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:43,269
Hello.

814
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:45,670
(President Yeo Woon Young)

815
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,269
By the way, Ms. Joo.

816
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,869
Yes?

817
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:19,239
What you told me earlier
about Mr. Park.

818
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,309
Why did you say that?

819
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,110
Well, because...

820
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,710
You make it look so obvious.

821
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,250
That you like him.

822
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,320
What?

823
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:31,619
When?

824
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:32,920
When did I say...

825
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,989
I saw you two whisper in private.

826
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,329
You got the wrong idea
because of that?

827
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,670
No way. That was because...

828
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,199
we had something to talk
about President Yeo.

829
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,469
- President Yeo?
- Yes.

830
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,900
The truth is,

831
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,010
when I listened to his lungs...

832
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,070
What of his lungs?

833
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,780
Did President Yeo's lungs
make a sound?

834
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,380
No, I didn't hear anything.

835
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,389
My tongue slipped.

836
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,360
Forget all I just said.

837
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:11,889
Goodbye.

838
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:14,360
What was that?

839
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,400
(Doldam Hospital)

840
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:23,840
Right now...

841
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,409
Take it, quick.

842
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:31,179
Time for anastomosis.

843
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:32,179
Scalpel.

844
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:37,590
Scissors.

845
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,590
Suture.

846
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,960
Master Kim, the ER called.

847
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,829
A gunshot victim is coming in.

848
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,940
A gunshot?

849
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,139
- Cut.
- Cut.

850
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,449
Yes. Thugs got into a fight
at the casino,

851
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:06,849
and a gun went off as the police
tried to apprehend them.

852
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,579
If it's a gunshot wound, we need GS.

853
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,590
What now?

854
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,090
What should we do?

855
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,989
Master Kim and Dr. Seo
have both just started.

856
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,789
Vitals.

857
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,360
He's okay at the moment.

858
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,769
In everything,

859
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:33,409
if there's a beginning,
there's an end.

860
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,389
Leaving like this...

861
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,960
isn't all bad.

862
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,570
I have no family,

863
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,440
so to me, the last 10 years
at Doldam Hospital...

864
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,750
were very special times
that I'm grateful for.

865
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,719
I'll release the clamp.

866
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,119
I don't see any leakage.

867
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,630
Dr. Bae, let's wrap this up.

868
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:32,300
A gunshot patient is coming in,
so we'll need the OR.

869
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:33,530
Yes, Master Kim.

870
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,239
We'll wrap this up here,

871
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,539
move her to the ICU,
and reschedule his surgery.

872
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,710
Okay.

873
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,039
Good job, everyone.

874
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,079
Runner.

875
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,380
You did well.

876
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,219
Let's close her up.

877
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,230
Sure, Dr. Bae. Let's close her up.

878
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,559
Irrigation.

879
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:06,599
After drifting along a long river
that has been my life,

880
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,039
I have realized that although
you can take a break,

881
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:12,969
you can never stop all together.

882
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,050
So let's not be
too upset about this.

883
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:20,820
Mom, it's me.

884
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:24,989
You called when I was in surgery.

885
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:28,090
What?

886
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,690
I'm happy, that's all.

887
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,530
The surgery went really well.

888
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,929
That's why I'm so happy.

889
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:42,340
Yes, I actually did it.

890
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,480
I was showered with compliments.

891
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:51,710
It wasn't an easy one.

892
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:59,550
Vacated spots will
soon be filled once again.

893
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:03,690
It's how nature runs its course.

894
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:11,400
Gauze, please.

895
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:15,570
Hemostat.

896
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:17,769
Towel clip, please.

897
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,650
I wanted to say goodbye...

898
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:27,550
to each and every one of you,

899
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,920
but I knew that'll make me
not want to leave.

900
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,219
That's why I'm leaving this way.

901
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,559
I don't think there's
any other bleeding.

902
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:38,059
I'll locate the perforation
and perform a resection.

903
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:41,230
Okay.

904
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,559
Are you leaving?

905
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:18,429
Well, I should.

906
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340
That reminds me.

907
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:26,239
You know it's Friday, right?

- Hurry.

Guys, this way.

- Boss?
- Boss!

915
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:31,440
Where are you?

916
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,989
- Dr. Yun!
- Coming!

917
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,440
Everyone, take care.

918
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,070
Be yourselves.
Be the people of Doldam.

921
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,780
Do what?

922
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,579
- You can do it, right?
- Yes, I can.

923
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,920
I hear you're the liver, gall,
and pancreas specialist.

924
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,659
Show us what you're made of.

925
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,489
- You're not bad.
- Right.

926
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,059
You promised.

927
01:05:58,059 --> 01:06:00,159
What are you talking about?
Mr. Park?

928
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,429
I found a way
to get rid of Boo Yong Joo.

929
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:07,030
He can be even worse to deal with
than Do Yun Wan.

930
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:09,670
In order to do so, I should start...

931
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,239
by controlling your deranged ways.
