Hang in there.

We're almost at Doldam.

00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,510
Hang in there, okay?

12

- Jeong Bae. Wake up.
- Gunshot victim!

23
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,359
Mom, I have to go.

80 over 40, the heart rate was 130.

28

- Bed three.
- Okay.

29
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,139
Separate them by
degree of severity...

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,680
- and mark with cards.
- Okay.

31
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,250
We have a chest stab wound!

- In the chest?
- Yes.

BP is 90 over 40,
the heart rate is 130.

Did you take out the knife
at the scene?

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,360
It was out when we found him.

To the hybrid room.

Warm saline until the blood is here.

and do an end-to end-anastomosis.

- Okay?
- I got it.

Are the vitals holding?

78
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,550
They stabilized after
you stopped the bleeding.

79
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,319
You take care of the rest from here.

into his chest.

You're disrupting the treatment.
Please move away.

94
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,160
This way, boss.

95
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,459
- That way?
- Yes.

As you see, they're working hard
on the patients.

Not those kids!

101

Master Kim! Where's Master Kim?

102
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,449
He's in surgery, detective.

103
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,680
Our rookie...

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,850
He was shot and
his life hangs by a thread.

105
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,620
Get Master Kim here right now!

106
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,420
You can't do that.

107

Our boss' life
is hanging in the balance.

108

You can't steal Master Kim away.

109
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,470
There is an order to things.

110
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:11,839
Step aside, jerks.

111
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,439
There's a time to move
and not to move.

112
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,970
I don't see the reason right now.

113
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,439
Oh, dear.

114
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,180
I don't see the reason
right now myself.

115
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,579
Do you have a death wish?

116
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,079
- No, don't.
- Let go!

117
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,180
Calm down.

118
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,589
Guys. Did you hear that?

119
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's just all fight to the death...

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,959
and die with our boss!

121
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,389
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!

122
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,060
How dare you?

123
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Come at me.

124
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,129
How dare you?

125
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,370
Look down.

126
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,699
You can't do this here. Calm down!

127
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,399
Kill me then!

128
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,110
What are you all doing?

129
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,250
Master Kim.

130
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,290
Why is it so noisy here?

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,189
This is a hospital!

132
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,089
Our Jeong Bae...

133
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,660
He was shot, Master Kim.

134
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,129
The gunshot victim
was Detective Shin?

135
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,000
What about our boss?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,269
He was... He got
stabbed in the chest.

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,209
Su Cheol, again?

138
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,779
If you must fight,

139
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,850
fight fairly with your fists!

140
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,490
Do you have to be stupid
and use such dangerous things?

141
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm busy as it is!

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,919
That's my point, Master Kim.

143
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,860
We're busiest on Fridays.

144
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,460
It's their fault.

145
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,700
They got into a drunken fight.

146
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,259
It wasn't like that!

147
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,000
The Starfish Gang picked on us!

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,169
What?

149
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,340
Be quiet!

150
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,070
I'll tear your mouths,
the lot of you.

151
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,879
- Manager Jang!
- Yes?

152
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,750
Clear out this room!

153
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,850
My gosh, I'm sick of the lot of you.

154
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,919
Move.

155
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,590
You heard Master Kim.

156
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,289
Calm down, if you please.

157
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,529
Those in organized crime,

158
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,659
step out to the lobby.

159
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,730
If the detectives can take
the ER waiting area,

160
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,039
I'd be very grateful.

161
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,769
Master Kim?

162
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,919
The fools.

163
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,789
How's the gunshot victim?

164
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,990
We just placed the MAC
and are pouring in warm saline.

165
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,289
I think the wound is to the liver.

166
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,799
Where's the exit wound?

167
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,830
What? There isn't one?

168
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,129
No. I checked his back,

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,639
and there isn't one.

170
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,740
His pulse is slowing.

171
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,039
It's PEA. PEA!

172
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,309
Epinephrine.

173
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,279
Get me an intubation kit!

174
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,480
Master Kim, I think my patient
has a penetrating injury.

175
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,179
- Cardiac?
- Yes.

176
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,789
I'm draining him for the fifth time
and blood is still pooling.

177
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:16,789
Vitals?

178
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,259
The initial systolic blood pressure
was 80.

179
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,419
It was 100 after identifying
the cardiac tamponade...

180
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,559
and doing a pericardiocentesis.

181
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,159
It's 90 now. Should we go to the OR?

182
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,399
Fix at 22cm. Pull out the wire.

183
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,730
Ms. Uhm. Call OR One...

184
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,500
and ask how much longer it'll take.

185
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,669
Okay.

186
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,149
What's the matter?

187
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,710
Is it emergency surgery?

188
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,049
Follow me.

189
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:58,929
Ji Hye.

190
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,269
What about my husband?

191
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,600
Master Kim went inside just now.

192
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,100
He will be all right.

193
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,710
Oh, my.

194
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,850
I'll go get the defibrillator.

195
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,919
I feel his pulse. ROSC.

196
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,750
(ROSC:
Return of spontaneous circulation)

197
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,289
What about the blood?

198
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,490
It's here.

199
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,190
Set up a RIS
and start the blood transfusion.

200
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,360
- Have the OR ready.
- Yes, doctor.

201
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,570
Transfer this patient quickly
to OR Two.

202
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,169
Wait. Everyone, stop.

203
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,580
Is he the patient
with the gunshot wound?

204
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,610
Yes, he just had a cardiac arrest.

205
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,450
We need to operate on him quickly.

206
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,480
Is that really necessary?

207
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,789
Necessary?

208
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,620
What are you talking about?

209
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,789
He was shot
and had a cardiac arrest already.

210
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,629
It means he has serious damage
in his major organs.

211
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,059
And?

212
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,299
It's not the right thing
to do for doctors...

213
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,169
to waste time on hopeless patients.

214
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,039
You should rather take care of those
whom you can save.

215
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,610
This patient here needs
a cardiac surgeon.

216
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,950
Mommy.

217
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,049
Daddy.

218
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,789
Mommy.

219
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,100
Dr. Seo is finishing up now.

220
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,700
He can vacate the room
in 15 minutes.

221
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,730
Okay.

222
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,070
All right. Move this patient
to the OR Two.

223
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,070
Yes, doctor.

224
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,870
Master Kim.

225
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,370
What should we do with this patient?

226
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,179
Open him up,

227
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,250
and stop the bleeding
with staples first.

228
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,049
Me? Here?

229
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,590
Are you out of your mind?

230
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,190
She can't even operate properly
because of her nausea.

231
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,389
What did you just tell her
to do here?

232
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:10,159
They're almost done with the bowel
perforation in the OR One.

233
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,600
Hold the bleeding...

234
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,659
until we transfer him
to the OR, okay?

235
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,870
Dr. Boo Yong Joo.

236
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,100
You could not save
both the patients.

237
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,470
How noisy.

238
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,870
Someone said,

239
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,139
"The moment you give up,
you start to look for excuses".

240
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,610
"The moment you think you can do it,
you find a way".

241
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,679
If you're that worried,

242
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,279
why don't you operate
on this patient yourself?

243
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,950
I hear you're the liver, gall,
and pancreas specialist.

244
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,590
Show us what you're made of...

245
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,190
instead of looking for excuses
to run off.

246
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,830
- Hey, Runner.
- Yes, doctor.

247
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,000
Can you do it?

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,139
Yes, I can.

249
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay.

250
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,350
Let's go.

251
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,029
Hey.

252
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,860
Think wisely.

253
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,899
If something happens to the patient,

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,970
you'll take all the blame.

255
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Okay?

256
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,539
Are you really going to do it?

257
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,440
Please keep him under sedation.

258
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,610
I'll be right back.

259
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,450
My goodness.

260
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,019
- Cut.
- Cut.

261
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,200
Done.

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,570
Move the patient to the ICU.

263
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,230
Good work, Dr. Seo.

264
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,169
Then I'll join the operation
on the gunshot patient.

265
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,740
Wait.

266
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,750
You shouldn't make this mistake
after pulling off the surgery.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,590
Mr. Park, please take the patient
to the ICU.

268
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,789
Let's go, Dr. Seo.

269
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,190
Good work.

270
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,850
Dr. Cha Eun Jae.

271
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,690
Are you...

272
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,659
the doctor...

273
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,129
who stabbed our boss in his chest
with a stick earlier?

274
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,000
How can I help you?

275
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
What is this about?

276
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,539
If something happens to our boss,

277
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,840
then...

278
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,309
you and I will die together.

279
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,720
Pull yourself together...

280
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,220
and do your job properly.

281
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,350
Do you understand, doctor?

282
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,430
Move.

283
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,930
The patient could be in danger
if the treatment gets delayed.

284
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,869
Aren't you going to move?

285
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,920
Put down all the blinds.

286
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,000
Give up if you don't think
you can do it.

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,160
You don't have to overdo yourself.

288
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,869
Master Kim wants me to do it.

289
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,130
He told me to do it,

290
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,769
and that means he trusts me.

291
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,210
Aren't you afraid of Dr. Park?

292
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,269
I am.

293
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,779
But Master Kim is my superior
in Doldam Hospital.

294
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,410
His orders are my priority.

295
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,450
That's my way to survive.

296
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,650
He's a gang leader.

297
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,490
If things go wrong,

298
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,089
your life could be faced with
the bridge over troubled water.

299
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,430
This is driving me crazy.

300
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,849
I thought it'd only be Seo Jung...

301
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,549
who cut a patient open in here.

302
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,890
What I did I do wrong
in my past life?

303
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,789
Not just once, but twice...

304
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,359
Antiseptic, please.

305
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,099
Drape.

306
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,740
Scalpel.

307
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,559
Bovie.

308
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,799
Sternal saw.

309
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,799
(Sternal saw: A bone cutter
used to open a patient's chest)

310
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,269
Give it to me.

311
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Sir...

312
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,740
Sternal retractor, please.

313
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,859
It's going to bleed a lot this time.

314
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,470
Prepare enough tap gauze.

315
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,369
Have the suction
and staples ready right away.

316
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Scissors.

317
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,119
- Gosh.
- Gauze.

318
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,119
Please, please...

319
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,059
Please.

320
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,329
Have you found it?

321
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,529
Have you?

322
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,410
I found it. Staples!

323
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,950
Stay calm, Eun Jae.

324
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,859
Okay.

325
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,490
Are we good?

326
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,230
How are his vitals?

327
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,000
90 over 40,
and the heart rate is 100.

328
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,500
Yes, I think we're good.

329
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,009
Dr. Cha, it's the OR.

330
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,380
Yes?

331
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,650
How did it go?

332
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,950
There was a 1cm opening
in the right ventricle.

333
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,049
I just clamped it with staples.

334
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,519
Suction.

335
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,890
Then transport the patient
to OR One.

336
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,420
Yes, Master Kim.

337
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,630
Master Kim, shouldn't you
join her in the OR?

338
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,759
Dr. Cha can't handle
an opening in the RV alone.

339
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,630
Let's focus on
finding this bullet first.

340
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,039
My vision is impaired
due to all the blood.

341
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,609
Pringle intestinal forceps.

342
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,009
Hold onto this.

343
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,150
- Boss?
- Please make way.

344
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,289
- But...
- Move out of the way.

345
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,660
- Hold on.
- Boss!

346
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Coming through!

347
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,930
- Hurry.
- Come on.

348
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,960
Unbelievable.

349
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,690
Please have a seat.

350
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,359
That was a lot.

351
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,130
You did an amazing job.
That was incredible.

352
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,700
Before the exhaustion takes my life,

353
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,240
I'll die from a shriveled heart.

354
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,039
You should rest.

355
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,880
I'll take care of things
for a while.

356
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,609
Incoming!

357
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,519
Oh my goodness.

358
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,390
Talk about a colossal mess.

359
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,660
No basic rules, no principles,
and no protocol.

360
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,230
It's a total mess.

361
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,200
Anyway, where did Dr. Park go?

362
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,819
I hear you're the liver, gall,
and pancreas specialist.

363
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,319
Show us what you're made of...

364
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,859
instead of looking for excuses
to run off.

365
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,599
Help!

366
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,869
Long forceps.

367
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,559
There's more damage
to the liver than we anticipated.

368
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,319
The patient has arrived in OR One.

369
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,529
She wants to know if she should
give an anesthetic to him.

370
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,579
Yes, this is Park Min Guk.

371
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,920
Are you going to stand there
and admire the view all night?

372
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,990
The bullet has been removed,

373
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,690
and a segmentectomy
was performed on segment seven.

374
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,960
It's been clamped for seven minutes
by the pringle intestinal forceps.

375
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,230
and another patient is waiting
in OR One.

376
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,029
- Are you asking me for a favor?
- No.

377
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm telling you to do your duty.

378
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,910
He just left. What now?

379
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,089
Tell OR One to give an anesthetics
to the patient.

380
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,220
Yes, Master Kim.

381
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,059
What about this patient then?

382
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,359
I'll do it.

383
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,230
Operating on a liver is too risky
for a second-year fellow.

384
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,569
I'm not doubting your skills,

385
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,769
but the surgery should be performed
by someone with experience.

386
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,369
It's why I called over
an experienced surgeon.

387
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,369
But he just left.

388
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,579
I'll do it. Let me do it instead.

389
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,640
I can do it, you know.

390
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,450
There will be a change of hands.

391
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,960
The lead surgeon for this patient
is now Dr. Park.

392
00:25:58,829 --> 00:25:59,859
Make sure you save him.

393
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,779
How long has it been clamped?

394
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,579
- 13 minutes.
- Gauze.

395
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,789
Bovie.

396
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,619
Pringle intestinal forceps out.

397
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,799
Suction.

398
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,230
CUSA.

399
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,809
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

400
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,140
Wait, he's in surgery? Dr. Park?

401
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,910
I called just in case
and it was confirmed.

402
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,309
That would never happen though.

403
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,880
He went into surgery
without calling me first?

404
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,549
Apparently,
Dr. Seo is assisting him.

405
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,460
- Seo Woo Jin?
- Yes.

406
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,589
We'll now move on to...

407
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:03,029
finding the Glisson's capsule
in segment seven.

408
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,430
It will contain the bleeding
and give us a better view.

409
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,559
Bulldogs.

410
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,839
Segment seven of the liver
is changing color.

411
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,970
Then we did it right.

412
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,680
Bovie.

413
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,279
CUSA.

414
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,619
I located the Glisson's capsule to
segment seven and will now repair.

415
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,990
(Glisson's capsule: a layer of
tissue surrounding the liver)

416
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,289
I can see the vein now.

417
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,220
Vascular stapler, please.

418
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,829
You have decent hands.

419
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:47,900
I guess.

420
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,569
Good. Let's check the rest
and close him back up.

421
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,940
Bovie.

422
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,680
It's not pierced through, though.

423
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,180
It's just lodged in his scapula.

424
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,380
Should we do the procedure here?

425
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,250
It's still an open fracture
which needs to be operated in an OR.

426
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,319
Also, we must check his thigh...

427
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,829
for any severe damage as well.

428
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,029
But all the ORs
are occupied, Dr. Bae.

429
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,059
Really?

430
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,700
His vitals are stable,

431
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
so we'll move him
once an OR is free.

432
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,240
Forget it. Just take it out.

433
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,039
I've been stabbed
by my fair share of hatchets.

434
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,140
I'm sorry,

435
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,680
but we need you to wait
despite the discomfort.

436
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm saying...

437
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,109
that I don't have time
to wait around in here.

438
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,779
Take it out right now...

439
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,619
or have me transferred
to another hospital.

440
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,819
No, wait.

441
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,319
I guess we can't stop you...

442
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,920
from going to another hospital.

443
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,289
Please note...

444
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,329
that you're risking
massive hemorrhage...

445
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,259
by being transported though.

446
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,930
You should be aware
that it could be fatal.

447
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,039
Will you still like
to be transported?

448
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,150
Sir, I know it's not comfortable,
but please lie down for a while.

449
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,279
We'll move you to an OR
as soon as one is vacant.

450
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,549
Careful.

451
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,390
Watch the hatchet!

452
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,690
Please be careful.

453
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,130
Gently...

454
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,500
Right, good job.

455
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,730
That was great.

456
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,710
I'm sorry...

457
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,049
for not being able
to protect Jeong Bae.

458
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,420
Mommy...

459
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,859
Daddy.

460
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:25,660
Mommy...

461
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,700
- Mommy.
- Darn it.

462
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,099
Staple remover, please.

463
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,349
There's no bleeding.

464
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,250
No contamination.

465
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,990
Su Cheol, consider yourself lucky.

466
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,589
The runner here...

467
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,190
treated you well.

468
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,130
Whatever I put my mind to,
I do well.

469
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,599
What about your nausea?

470
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,369
They're not present.

471
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,099
No hyperpnea?

472
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,109
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

473
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:12,140
Suture.

474
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Sorry?

475
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,210
Suture scissors!

476
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,119
Suture scissors, please.

477
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,390
Darn it.

478
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,529
(Hope, Love, Service)

479
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,029
Where did the worthless cow go?

480
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,559
Soo Jin...

481
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,640
(ICU)

482
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,910
Manager Jang.

483
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,579
What's this?

484
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,549
I found it in the waiting area.

485
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,849
The hat looks like President Yeo's.

486
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,289
Why was it there?

487
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,619
This too.

488
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,910
- Good job.
- Good job, everyone.

489
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,180
- Thank you.
- Good work.

490
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,009
- Good job.
- Good job today.

491
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,920
Cut. How are his vitals?

492
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,559
Master Kim is
overexerting himself again.

493
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,960
Well,

494
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,960
we should be glad that
Dr. Park took over our patient.

495
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,769
He seemed like
a skilled surgeon too.

496
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,140
Having a surgeon in Doldam
with his skills...

497
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:22,069
would definitely lift the burden
off Master Kim's shoulders.

498
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,710
He shouldn't be
the president though.

499
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,539
President Yeo
is still fit to lead us,

500
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,150
and even if he were to retire,

501
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,750
I believe that only Master Kim
can take his place.

502
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,590
How did it go?
Was it a successful surgery?

503
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,590
The patient is currently in the ICU.

504
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,789
Good.

505
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,800
What would you have done
if I hadn't stepped in?

506
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,570
Isn't it obvious?

507
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,500
I would've gone from
one OR to the other...

508
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,300
and made it happen.

509
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,070
Have you been
running this hospital...

510
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,409
by continuously making
those risky and reckless decisions?

511
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,079
It's how it is at Doldam.

512
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,480
Unexpected patients...

513
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,719
come flooding in
at inconvenient moments.

514
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,780
I've been making decisions...

515
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,619
that are appropriate
considering the circumstances.

516
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,320
At times, taking risks
are inevitable.

517
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,230
And how many patients
have you lost because of it?

518
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,030
Still,

519
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,369
the number of patients I saved
outnumber them.

520
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,539
You are...

521
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,909
more reckless
than I even imagined, Dr. Boo.

522
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,579
I told you that
this isn't a place...

523
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,380
where you can conduct
elegant surgery...

524
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,719
while listening to classical music.

525
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,489
Don't bite off
more than you can chew...

526
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,519
and take your crew
back to where you belong.

527
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,530
I think otherwise.

528
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,199
What happened today...

529
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,500
illustrated what this hospital
is in most need of.

530
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,269
What needs to be set up first...

531
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:36,469
is the system and protocol
that this hospital doesn't have.

532
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,739
In order to do so, I should start...

533
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:45,849
by controlling your deranged ways,
Dr. Boo.

534
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,119
Master Kim.

535
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,760
At this hospital,

536
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,730
that's how people address me.

537
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Dr. Park.

538
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,840
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

539
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,550
My colleague Dr. Park Min Guk...

540
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,420
took very good care of your husband.

541
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,219
That's him over there.

542
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,820
Doctor, thank you so much.

543
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,190
- Goodness.
- Thank you so much.

544
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

545
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,860
We were deeply worried.

546
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,159
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

547
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,500
Thank you so much.

548
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,449
What are you doing here?

549
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:53,920
Mun Jung.

550
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,050
Do you have
another surgery lined up?

551
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,119
Yes.

552
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,789
The man with a hatchet
in his back...

553
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,530
Unbelievable, right?

554
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,429
This place is utter chaos.

555
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:06,429
Who knew that...

556
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:07,960
a hospital in the countryside
would get this busy?

557
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,699
Actually, that's what I thought
when I applied for a position here.

558
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,900
I reckoned I'd have more time
to enjoy a personal life.

559
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,710
It's more chaotic
than any other trauma center.

560
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,739
You're right.

561
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,539
Being crazily busy
has its perks though.

562
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,079
Your life becomes simpler...

563
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,880
and your head is less filled
with meaningless thoughts.

564
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,389
I had no idea I'd be able
to fix my OR-phobia here.

565
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,190
Have there been any side effects?

566
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,059
No.

567
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,760
Although I suddenly get hungry.

568
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,630
Then we should
grab a bite to drink sometime.

569
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,369
Hello, Mun Jung.

570
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:54,780
I'm the Bone Club's
newest addition...

571
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,949
Cha Eun Jae,
also known as Delicate Bones.

572
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,320
And?

573
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,849
I've got a few questions...

574
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,789
about the bones I've been studying.

575
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,820
Would we be able
to grab a bite to drink sometime?

576
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,960
Eating or drinking, which is it?

577
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,400
Sorry?

578
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,829
Let me know once you decide.

579
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,469
Let me know once you decide.

580
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,139
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

581
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,050
Seriously?

582
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:41,820
Check his Hemovac drain often.

583
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,960
Yes, doctor.

584
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,920
My goodness.

585
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,000
The patient hasn't yet
recovered from the anesthesia.

586
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,730
- He must rest until...
- Guys.

587
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,829
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!

588
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,739
To Dr. Cha Eun Jae.

589
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,510
Bow.

590
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,380
- Dr. Cha Eun Jae! Thank you!
- Dr. Cha Eun Jae! Thank you!

591
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,989
Master Kim told me everything.

592
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,320
That you, Dr. Cha.

593
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,659
You saved our boss...

594
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,599
You saved our boss' life.

595
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,170
Well, I didn't exactly...

596
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,369
save his life.

597
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,570
I just did an emergency procedure
to stop the bleeding.

598
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,809
From now on, we will serve you...

599
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,710
and forever be in your debt.

600
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,480
What?

601
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,179
From now on, to us, Dr. Cha,

602
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,420
you are the second most important,

603
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,460
after Master Kim.

604
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,829
If you ever have a problem...

605
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,699
or difficulties while you're here,

606
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,570
you can give me a call
without hesitation.

607
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,940
We'll let you...

608
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,380
get some rest, Dr. Cha.

609
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,510
- Get some rest, Dr. Cha!
- Get some rest, Dr. Cha!

610
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,019
- You can pass.
- No, thanks.

611
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,619
Go on then.

612
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,340
The surgery went well.

613
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,480
We'll observe for a few days,

614
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,380
then move you to the ward.

615
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,780
Why did you save me?

616
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,320
You should've...

617
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,289
just left me to die.

618
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,130
Why?

619
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,699
So you'd suffer.

620
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,030
If you just die,
you'll never know...

621
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,469
what you did.

622
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,139
A family murder-suicide?

623
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,880
What a joke.

624
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,619
The powerless children...

625
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,420
were victims to...

626
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,219
your violence.

627
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,559
Don't blame it
on finances or depression.

628
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,630
You are...

629
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,269
just a weak and cruel human.

630
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,869
Do you get that?

631
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,449
Blame yourself and suffer forever.

632
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,309
Live in pain.

633
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,449
And pay for what you did.

634
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,289
Only then...

635
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,130
it is fair for the dead child.

636
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,340
Aren't you hungry?

637
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,380
The others gathered for some food.

638
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,579
Will you join us?

639
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,280
No, I'm not hungry.

640
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,260
(ICU)

641
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:57,539
It's okay.

642
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,809
You'll get better.

643
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,659
(Doldam Hospital)

644
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,869
Seo Woo Jin refuses to
leave the building.

645
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,429
What should we do, boss?

646
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,900
Shall I go in and drag him out?

647
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,409
Let him be.

648
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,239
What wouldn't he do
if he's willing to die?

649
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:38,079
(Doldam Hospital)

650
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,119
I don't know what's going on.

651
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,320
I called him, but he won't answer.

652
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,019
What is he thinking?

653
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,530
Did President Yeo
say anything to you?

654
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,460
Who else knows about this letter?

655
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,070
Right now, it's just you and me.

656
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,440
And Mr. Lee who found the letter.

657
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,570
Don't tell anyone about this today.

658
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,039
Everyone's exhausted.

659
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:11,579
We'll talk tomorrow.

660
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,650
What about Ms. Oh?

661
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,050
No. Keep it from her as well.

662
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm so worried.

663
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:24,389
She'll suffer more than anyone
when she finds out.

664
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,369
I refused to touch it.

665
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,380
You should get a refund.

666
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,820
Come on.

667
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,250
Hey!

668
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,889
Get Master Kim!

669
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
What are you doing out here?

670
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:59,389
I'm enjoying the laughter.

671
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:04,300
It's good to be young.

672
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,599
I thought they'd pass out
with exhaustion.

673
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,909
Shall we have just one drink?

674
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,469
I'd like that.

675
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,440
I'll get ready to leave.

676
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,280
I'll be nice.

677
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,730
Oh, dear.

678
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,760
Do I have to go into town?

679
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:11,429
It's freezing.

680
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,820
I'm sorry. My gosh.
I didn't see it coming.

681
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,289
What's wrong with you?

682
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,059
Cha Eun Jae?

683
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,099
Seo Woo Jin?

684
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,679
Good morning.

685
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,480
Good morning, Ms. Oh.

686
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,679
Where's President Yeo?

687
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,920
He's not here yet.

688
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,250
He's slightly later than usual.

689
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,489
He should have days like this too.

690
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,389
He's way too hard-working.

691
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,130
What's that?

692
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,699
Vitamins.

693
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,469
I thought he'd look better
after a holiday,

694
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,670
but he still looks a bit pale.

695
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,300
I got him some vitamins.

696
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,769
- Go on upstairs.
- Okay.

697
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,050
- Ms. Uhm. Did you hear about that?
- About what?

698
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,550
I heard we might have
a new president.

699
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,690
What?

700
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,190
Who told you that?

701
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,989
What's that nonsense?

702
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,960
Mr. Lee from the Administration.

703
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,590
I heard it from him.

704
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,019
(They may rot
if you water them too much.)

705
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,960
Mr. Jang.

706
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:22,659
Mr. Jang!

707
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,070
Did something happen
to President Yeo?

708
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,969
What do you mean?

709
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,510
I don't understand.

710
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,940
I went to the President's Office
and found this.

711
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:39,480
Where is Master Kim?
Is he at work?

712
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,550
He slept in his office last night.

713
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,860
I just went
to the President's Office...

714
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,099
and found this stuck on the pot.

715
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,269
(They may rot
if you water them too much.)

716
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:01,769
(Spray water on the leaves
once every 2 weeks.)

717
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,110
His desk and everywhere
were cleared up.

718
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,880
It was clean...

719
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,409
as if he was going
somewhere far away.

720
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,019
Master Kim.

721
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,820
Master Kim. Don't you know anything?

722
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:58,989
He must've felt more at ease...

723
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,929
to leave like that.

724
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,429
Everyone, take care.

725
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,400
Be the people of Doldam.

726
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,570
Be yourselves.

727
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,280
He won't answer his phone.
I've tried a few times too.

728
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,219
Please leave a message
after the beep.

729
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,019
Ms. Oh.

730
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,260
The person you have called
cannot be reached.

731
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,590
Ms. Oh.

732
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,460
Still, this is not right!

733
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,059
Master Kim.

734
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,670
We...

735
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,730
We must not...

736
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,340
let him go like this.

737
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:45,739
Right, Master Kim?

738
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,579
How... How could he do this to us?

739
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,480
Without any words
and saying goodbye,

740
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,949
he just left a single letter.

741
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,750
Master Kim, what is this about?

742
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,489
What happened to President Yeo?

743
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,940
- We need to talk.
- I have nothing to talk to you.

744
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:23,250
The man in the car earlier.

745
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,179
He's the same man who came to
see you at the hospital yesterday,

746
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,179
right?

747
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,489
Are you being threatened?

748
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,590
What do you mean?

749
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,730
Actually, I saw you that night.

750
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,699
You were with those men.

751
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:56,039
This is 10,000 dollars.

752
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,880
Woo Jin, are you kidding me?

753
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,920
How are you going to pay back
70,000 dollars at this rate?

754
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,550
Why is it suddenly 70,000 dollars?

755
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,449
I already paid back 10,000,
so I owe you 40,000 dollars.

756
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,960
What about the interest?

757
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:14,300
Aren't they loan sharks?

758
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,159
I told you,
it's none of your business.

759
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,170
Just report them to the police.

760
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,730
They come to you late at night.

761
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,170
They even come to your workplace
and harass you.

762
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,269
That's all illegal.

763
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,670
Report them all...

764
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,809
so that they can't
harass you ever again.

765
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:31,579
Should I do it for you?

766
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,719
Threatening is the same as violence.

767
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:39,920
It's an act of crime...

768
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,659
which must not be tolerated
in any situation.

769
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,829
What? Why?

770
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:54,639
Do you have a crush on me?

771
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,039
What? You lunatic.
What are you saying?

772
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,280
If not, don't meddle with it.

773
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,820
I'll take care of my business
on my own, so stay out of it.

774
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,300
Am I the only one who's mad?

775
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,570
It must not have been easy
for President Yeo.

776
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,539
It's not easy for me
to accept it either.

777
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,710
I am trying to understand him,
but this is still not right.

778
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,019
He decided to do this
nevertheless...

779
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,920
probably because he had
a reason to do so.

780
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,590
Both President Yeo and Master Kim.

781
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,159
Master Kim...

782
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,289
was aware of his decision?

783
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:27,860
If he hadn't known,
he wouldn't be so calm like that.

784
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,929
He would rather go grab
Do Yun Wan by the collar...

785
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:32,269
or beat him up.

786
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:38,369
Master Kim and President Yeo...

787
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,579
have never made decisions...

788
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,679
that could disappoint us.

789
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,079
Neither have they made decisions
which we couldn't follow.

790
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,150
When the time comes,

791
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:55,289
they will tell us why
they had to make this decision.

792
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,489
Let's wait for a little until then.

793
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,869
So,

794
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:15,809
did you find a way
to bring Boo Yong Joo down?

795
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:18,449
Perhaps.

796
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,349
That's ambiguous.

797
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,550
There's hardly a way
to beat that man at Doldam Hospital.

798
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,650
Instead,

799
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:29,690
it's possible to devalue...

800
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,230
what he believes is right.

801
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,199
How?

802
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,300
- Now?
- Yes, now.

803
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,440
They're taking the stuff out
from the president's office.

804
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,909
Darn.

805
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:58,550
(Emergency Medical Center)

806
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,190
What do we do, Ms. Uhm?

807
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,030
I guess Mr. Lee was right.

808
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:06,800
This is driving me crazy.

809
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:19,670
Mr. Park, did you know...

810
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,309
that President Yeo was resigning?

811
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,280
No, I didn't.

812
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,110
Must we keep it a secret...

813
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,320
even in this situation?

814
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,920
You promised me.

815
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,989
Ms. Uhm said that...

816
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:35,860
President Yeo resigned
with a single letter left behind.

817
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,889
Ms. Oh is upset because of it.

818
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,360
Things have turned out this way,

819
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,659
and I think there's no point in
hiding the secret.

820
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:47,440
Maybe it's right
we tell them the truth.

821
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,639
Tell us what?

822
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,780
What is this about?

823
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,150
Mr. Park.

824
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,510
Who is there?

825
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:34,780
Is someone in there?

826
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,349
Are you in pain?

827
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,119
Ma'am?

828
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,329
Where is he right now?

829
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,039
No. You can't.

830
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:58,769
That jerk.

831
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,949
You.

832
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:12,719
Wake up.

833
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:16,219
- What is this?
- Did you beat up your wife?

834
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,769
Unbelievable.

835
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:27,500
Mind your own business
and get back to your job.

836
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:29,769
Look here.

837
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:31,969
Violence is unacceptable.

838
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,480
Especially beating up those
who are weaker than you...

839
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,679
is the worst. That's the lowest
one can stoop down to.

840
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,750
Get it?

841
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,119
Are you kidding me?
Get out of my face.

842
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,289
Did you just push me?

843
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:48,190
Yes, I did. So what?

844
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:50,730
What now?

845
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,190
What can you do about it?

846
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:54,130
We have a disturbance
in the waiting room.

847
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,300
Please come quickly.

848
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,130
You think being a doctor
gives you the right?

849
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,800
Sir, please.

850
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,230
Let go of me!

851
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,239
Unbelievable.

852
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,710
Who are you to stick your nose
in other people's business?

853
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,940
You beat up your wife.

854
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
Tell me I'm wrong!

855
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,510
What I do to my wife
is none of your concern.

856
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,920
Who do you think you are?
How dare you.

857
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,219
What makes you think
you can patronize me?

858
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,349
Sir, please.

859
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,519
- Sir, calm down.
- What gives you the right?

860
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,659
What now?

861
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:32,199
Ma'am, no.

862
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,969
Eun Jae.

863
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,630
Eun Jae? Eun Jae!

864
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,190
Eun Jae. Eun Jae!

865
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,929
- I need gauze and a lot of it.
- Yes, Doctor.

866
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,329
Eun Jae, stay with me.

867
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,000
Eun Jae!

868
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,170
Gosh. Unbelievable.

869
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,739
Have you caught anything?

870
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,579
You know how winter fishing is.

871
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,219
It's time you quit this habit.

872
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:36,690
It's bad for your health.

873
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,659
As if worrying about that...

874
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,329
will have any point.

875
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:52,710
Make sure you take these...

876
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,679
according to schedule.

877
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,619
How's the new president?

878
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:05,820
Well, he and our staff...

879
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,159
finally got acquainted yesterday.

880
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:46,130
I am Park Min Guk,
the new president of Doldam...

881
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,260
as of today.

882
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:56,639
During the past week,
I was fully made aware...

883
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:58,170
of how Doldam lacks...

884
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:00,440
in infrastructure
and working environment.

885
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,349
That's why I was greatly moved...

886
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,650
by the work you did here...

887
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,679
to save people's lives
despite your circumstances.

888
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:12,420
While I'm here,

889
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,159
this I promise you.

890
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:18,329
Improvement of labor conditions.

891
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:22,099
First and foremost,
you will all receive...

892
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,699
a raise of five percent.

893
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,800
Overtime pay will also
be increased...

894
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,139
by five percent.

895
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,139
Five percent?

896
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,510
For all the employees of Doldam?

897
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,849
Yes, that's right.

898
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,719
When I was offered
the position as president,

899
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,860
my first condition of acceptance...

900
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,059
was the pay raise for employees.

901
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,559
The board
has already signed it off...

902
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,630
and you'll receive the raise
starting this month.

903
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,409
As the man in charge,

904
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,480
I will do my best to provide...

905
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,980
better labor conditions
for you all...

906
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:17,349
and to save Doldam
from being in the red.

907
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,460
I hope we get along well.

908
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,420
- Thank you so much.
- Nice!

909
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,630
- Bravo!
- I can't believe it.

910
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,639
- Park Min Guk!
- Park Min Guk!

911
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,769
- Park Min Guk.
- Park Min Guk.

912
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:38,969
- Park Min Guk!
- Park Min Guk!

913
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,340
He's a smart man.

914
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,309
So it seems.

915
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,219
He's also cautious
and a man of principle.

916
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:53,320
(President Park Min Guk)

917
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,400
He could be
a more formidable opponent...

918
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,900
than Do Yun Wan ever was.

919
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,309
Would you be able to handle him?

920
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,909
That's for me to find out, I guess.

921
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,079
Of course.

922
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,989
Only you would willingly take on...

923
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,949
an uphill battle.

924
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:01,989
(Dr. Romantic 2)

925
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,530
How about you replace
the fellows first?

926
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,730
Seo Woo Jin, was it?

927
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,159
Do you want your bosses at Geodae...

928
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:08,599
to know about your dealings
with a loan shark?

929
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:09,829
Leave!

930
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:10,869
No!

931
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,230
I could get fired for this.

932
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,800
I'm fully prepared for that.

933
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,300
What if I won't?

934
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:17,969
Then Dr. Cha will suffer
the consequences.

935
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:21,179
That lady doctor provoked me first.

936
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:23,409
Do you agree
with what your husband said?

937
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,750
Eun Jae, stay with me. Eun Jae!

938
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,980
Eun Jae was only trying to help,
but you...

939
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,750
Ms. Oh.

940
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,690
Avoiding the risks
that could possibly occur...

941
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,889
is my principle as a doctor.

942
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,929
Your principle? What a joke.
