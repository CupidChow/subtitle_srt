1
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,679
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,460
You asked if I need a job.

3
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,189
The thing is,

4
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,289
I need money.

5
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,270
How much can you give me?

6
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,469
You need money,

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,040
so you'll go into the OR for that?

8
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,709
That's how it sounds like.
Am I right?

9
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,650
Yes.

10
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,750
If I offer a good price,

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,489
you'll sell yourself for anything?

12
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,420
If need be.

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,760
How much will you pay?

14
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,659
(Hope, Love, Service)

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,109
Help.

16
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,409
Please help.

17
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,980
Hello. That wasn't clear.
What did you say?

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,489
It's my mom and dad.

19
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,219
They're not moving.

20
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,189
Can you tell me more
about your situation?

21
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,900
I can't breathe.

22
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,270
Please help.

23
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,240
Can you confirm
your location as Buam-dong?

24
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,270
What's your address?

25
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,639
Hello? Sir?

26
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,780
Hello?

27
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm curious.

28
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,530
Why didn't you repair
the diaphragmatic tear yourself?

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,699
(Diaphragm: muscle across
the bottom of the ribcage)

30
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,569
I'm talking about the operation
at Geodae Medical Center.

31
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,479
There was no need
to call in another doctor.

32
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,550
I figured that a CS surgeon
was better skilled to handle it.

33
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,979
Is that all?

34
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,819
What other reason do you need?

35
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,120
I'm just curious, that's all.

36
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,229
Maybe you didn't know
how to do it yourself.

37
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,770
It's hot.

38
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,080
They were just baked
in our office stove heater.

39
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,979
Would you like one?

40
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,879
Sorry. I don't eat carbs after 6pm.

41
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,250
Oh, I see.

42
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,020
You're truly disciplined
when it comes to your health.

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,689
That's something
I always have trouble with.

44
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,930
I can do it but I chose not to.

45
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,800
Why take on
unnecessary responsibility?

46
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,099
No one's impressed
by a pay doctor...

47
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,409
who plays hero anyway.

48
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,439
It's not like I'll be paid more.

49
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,180
Is this how you usually
solve problems?

50
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,120
I was taught to do so to survive.

51
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,849
Then why did you expose your senior?

52
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,759
It doesn't make sense.

53
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,860
You don't want to be responsible,

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,290
and don't want to be noticed.

55
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,699
You just want to avoid the hassle,

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,829
and you blew the whistle?

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,569
I'm not here for counseling.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,310
You asked me to name your price.

59
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,009
I must know the basics.

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,620
I was just naive.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,660
A momentary lapse of judgment...

62
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,189
cut short my career as a doctor.

63
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,089
I regret it with
all my heart right now.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,529
Is that enough?

65
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,870
At the end of this corridor
is the staff room.

66
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,310
There are no buses out now.

67
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,720
You won't have
a place to stay, so tonight...

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,750
You haven't said...

69
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,019
how much you'll pay me yet.

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,259
Sleep in the staff room tonight
and return to Seoul tomorrow.

71
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,529
- You want me gone?
- Yes.

72
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,360
I think I got you wrong.

73
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,730
What are you doing?

74
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,439
You brought me here for this.
Is this a joke?

75
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,639
Do you think I'm that sweet?

76
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,009
You said you need help!

77
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,980
What I need is a doctor!

78
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,860
I'll pay you for your troubles
coming all this way.

79
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,629
Now get lost.

80
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,209
What am I doing here?

81
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,509
What?

82
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,269
Were you talking to me?

83
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,379
Are you going somewhere?

84
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,889
No. It's fine.

85
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,629
No. I'll help you.

86
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,800
I don't like others
touching my belongings.

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,399
I see.

88
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,069
- Good job.
- Same to you.

89
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,540
Thanks. Bye.

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,740
Manager Jang, you're still here.

91
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,279
I was interviewing the new doctors.

92
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,720
Oh, I see.

93
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,689
Oh, right. You left this earlier.

94
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,660
My extra fingers. Thank you.

95
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,189
- You're welcome.
- Bye.

96
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,139
It's been a month.

97
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,279
What? What do you mean?

98
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,779
Dr. Bae Mun Jung.

99
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,579
He came to Doldam Hospital
a month ago.

100
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,620
I got the feeling you were curious.

101
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,149
Me? I'm not.

102
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,329
Did he bring his family?

103
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,529
No. He came alone.

104
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,699
I heard he's newly single.

105
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,730
Newly single?

106
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,740
Mun Jung got divorced?

107
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,110
Do you want me to find out more?

108
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,420
No, well, you don't have to.

109
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,949
I see.

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,180
Yes. Okay.

111
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,929
Hello, Elizabeth.

112
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm back. Were you bored, all alone?

113
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,769
I can't breathe.

114
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,230
Save me.

115
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,690
One week.

116
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,129
Give me one week.

117
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,070
I'm great in the OR
if not anything else.

118
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,000
During that week,

119
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,240
I'll change your mind
with my skills.

120
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,080
In my whole life, I never
judged anyone with a price.

121
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,409
And I won't in the future.

122
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,350
I need 10,000 dollars.

123
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,519
Whether I'm paid
in advance or loaned,

124
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,919
I don't care.

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Make me 10,000 dollars for now.

126
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,159
Can you do that?

127
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,330
Why Seo Woo Jin?

128
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,870
His reputation within
the hospital is just terrible.

129
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,070
He doesn't get along with others,

130
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,669
and he has character flaws.

131
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,940
Not long ago,

132
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,679
there was a rumor that
he worked at a bar...

133
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,779
as a gigolo to pay his student loan.

134
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,480
Why don't you find someone else?

135
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,120
Can you do that?

136
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,389
Prove yourself then.

137
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,190
Within the week,
show me why I must...

138
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,759
change my mind.

139
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,200
Then will you get me 10,000 dollars?

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
It'll be much harder than you think.

141
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,409
Will you really
give me 10,000 dollars?

142
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,929
(Chapter 2: Mechanism of Accidents)

143
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,370
This is the chopper.
Route Green, Route Green.

144
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,440
All clear until Route A.

145
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,470
This is Window One.
Route Green, Route Green.

146
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,570
All clear until Route A.

147
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,779
Window Two, clear.

148
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,580
This is Window One.

149
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,279
Namhansanseong,
passing Route E. ETA 10.

150
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,919
This is Namhansanseong.
All clear. ETA 10.

151
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,590
This is the chopper. All clear. R2B.

152
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,929
We'll arrive in 10 minutes.

153
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,830
Okay.

154
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:10,100
How long will
the joint training go on for?

155
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,299
About two-and-a-half hours.

156
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,870
You'll watch for an hour,

157
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,740
then you have a 30-minute
strategy briefing.

158
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,240
Then we'll move to the next event.

159
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,610
Stop the car!

160
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,620
Mr. Park. Mr. Park, look up.

161
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,860
Head Peddler, report back.
Head Peddler, report back.

162
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,700
This is Head Peddler.
Code One. Code One!

163
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,500
Mr. Park, wake up. Mr. Park!

164
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,460
Hello. Good morning.

165
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,220
Hello. Good...

166
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,429
Who are you?

167
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,000
Hello.

168
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,139
I'm fourth-year EM resident
Yun Ah Reum.

169
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,840
I was transferred to Doldam's ER.

170
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,269
I hope we all get along.

171
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,340
Welcome. I'm Oh Myung Sim.

172
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,250
She's the head nurse
and the real big shot here.

173
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,750
And I am...

174
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,519
your high and lofty
direct senior Jung In Soo.

175
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,120
I manned this ER all on my own,

176
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,990
feeling so lonesome.

177
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,789
That long time...

178
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:41,360
Dr. Yoon left only two months ago.

179
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,429
Exactly.

180
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,330
Those two months felt so long.

181
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,500
Anyway, I'm so pleased
to have a comrade.

182
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm full of cheer now.

183
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,899
I'm Uhm Hyun Jung.

184
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,570
I'm the Doldam's ER expert.

185
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,639
You can ask me anything
you don't know.

186
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm Joo Young Mi.

187
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm also a newcomer who joined
this hospital two months ago.

188
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,450
- And this is...
- I'm Park Eun Tak.

189
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,419
I'm mostly at the ER when I don't
have any operations to go into.

190
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,019
You're handsome.

191
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,789
Excuse me?

192
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,460
You do have a good eye.

193
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,659
He's the handsome guy
in our hospital.

194
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,360
From grandmas to grade school kids,
everyone loves him.

195
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,740
Now that we introduced each other,
let's get to work.

196
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,899
- Ms. Joo.
- Okay.

197
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,110
Perhaps because it's in the morning,
we don't have many patients.

198
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
What...

199
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,480
What's wrong?

200
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,490
Did I say something wrong?

201
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,620
Well, Dr. Yun.

202
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,960
There's something
you must not say in this hospital.

203
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,129
What is it?

204
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,500
It's what you just said.

205
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,970
That there aren't many patients?

206
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,000
Dr. Yun!

207
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,610
I'll politely ask you once again.

208
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,950
Do not ever say that here...

209
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,679
in our hospital.

210
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,220
Regardless of reasons or facts,

211
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,990
don't do it. Never.

212
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,690
Do you understand?

213
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,159
Okay.

214
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,769
Why? Why can we not say that?

215
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,600
That's our jinx.

216
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,769
What jinx.

217
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,240
The moment someone says that,

218
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,840
we suddenly become busy
with emergency patients.

219
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,279
That's the frightening jinx
of our hospital.

220
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,350
What?

221
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,210
Gosh, I thought it was
something serious.

222
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,419
There's nothing like that
in the world.

223
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,019
(Doldam Hospital)

224
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,200
I can't believe this.

225
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,870
I can't believe this.

226
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,769
Is it just me?

227
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,440
No, I bet it's the same for you.

228
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,769
Let me hear your reason first.

229
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,470
Why on earth did you come here?

230
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,779
Didn't you hear the rumor?

231
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:13,940
No, I didn't.

232
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,509
I got fired from the main hospital.

233
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,649
Why, this time?

234
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,350
What made you get fired again?

235
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,850
Ask Ho Jun.
I'm curious about that too.

236
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,220
And why did you come here?

237
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
Didn't you hear the rumor?

238
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,830
No, I didn't.

239
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,730
Some GS surgeon insisted...

240
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,429
he wouldn't deal
with diaphragm tear.

241
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,330
I was forced to operate two times
in a row and passed out.

242
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,500
I was literally knocked down.

243
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Hey, that's not true.

244
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,440
You fell asleep.

245
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,710
No, I fainted.

246
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,210
I overworked way too much
from two days ago.

247
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,679
And I was struck with a cold too.

248
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,009
How will you explain your snoring?

249
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,750
- Do you have proof?
- Everyone in the OR heard it.

250
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,120
Should I send them a group text?

251
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,789
Do you even have their numbers?

252
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,389
It's not a big deal
to get their numbers.

253
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,720
I know no one is close enough
to tell you that.

254
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,830
It won't have any problem
checking the fact.

255
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,799
Goodness,
you're unbelievably annoying.

256
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,670
What are you doing?

257
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,109
What? What are you trying to pull?

258
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,380
Go away.

259
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,099
Sleep.

260
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,329
What?

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,069
You have sleep in your eye.

262
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,140
Darn.

263
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,920
Who...

264
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,720
Hello, sir.

265
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,420
I'm Cha Eun Jae, the second-year
CS fellow.

266
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,690
I see. You're the new doctors
who came yesterday.

267
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,730
Who are you?

268
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,359
What's wrong?

269
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,430
He's our senior from college.

270
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,529
He's a general surgeon.

271
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,269
His name is Seo Woo Jin.
We're from the same class.

272
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,740
So you guys are my juniors.

273
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,009
I'm orthopedic surgeon Bae Mun Jung.

274
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,539
- It's good to see you, juniors.
- Me too.

275
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,819
I guess you came to work now.

276
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,349
Right, I'm a little late.

277
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:37,390
Gosh, sir.
Please drop the honorifics.

278
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,190
We're years behind you.

279
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,140
We have an emergency patient.
Aren't you coming with me?

280
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,380
Coming!

281
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,490
(Emergency Medical Center)

282
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,730
Hello, this is Master Kim
of Doldam Hospital.

283
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,539
Gosh, hello. What's the occasion?

284
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,670
What?

285
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,410
We need you to vacate
the ER completely.

286
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,880
The whole ER?

287
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,319
We can't do that.

288
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,150
This is an inevitable situation.
We need your cooperation.

289
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,920
I see. I understand.

290
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,660
You're working for someone big.
Of course...

291
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,759
No.

292
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,259
I understand your situation,

293
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,960
but we can't let you
take control over the ER.

294
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,400
It's the Minister
we're talking about.

295
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,930
I get that,

296
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,240
but we can't send
other emergency patients away.

297
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,769
It's the principle of our hospital.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,509
Who on earth is here?

299
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,369
It's the Minister
of National Defense.

300
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,339
What? The Minister
of National Defense?

301
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,109
Wait, who are you?

302
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,349
They are new doctors here.

303
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,119
Oh, it's good to see you.

304
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,250
- I'm the EM doctor, Jung...
- Ms. Oh.

305
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,819
The ambulance will arrive
with the Minister in two minutes.

306
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,789
Now please leave.

307
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,700
We have to get ready
to treat the patients.

308
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,859
This is for the smooth treatment
for the Minister.

309
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,529
Step aside.

310
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,799
It's better you do that for now.

311
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,970
Let's go for the sake
of the Minister.

312
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,710
There, let's go.

313
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,509
Eun Tak, call Master Kim.

314
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Have enough of warm saline ready...

315
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,910
along with a central line.

316
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,079
- Okay.
- Okay.

317
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,119
Ms. Oh, they are the new doctors.

318
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,390
Hello, I'm Cha Eun Jae,
a second-year cardiac surgeon.

319
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,759
I'm general surgeon Seo Woo Jin.

320
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,420
I'm Oh Myung Sim, the head nurse.

321
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,829
- And I...
- We're expecting patients...

322
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,829
who got injured in a car accident
on a highway nearby.

323
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,599
The driver died on the spot.

324
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,799
The one in the passenger seat
and the Minster in the back seat...

325
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,170
are in major trauma.

326
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,869
Especially, the Minister didn't have
his seatbelt fastened,

327
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,240
so he's has a blunt abdominal
trauma with abnormal vital signs.

328
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
Get things ready.

329
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,309
Dr. Yun, have MAC catheter
and sonography ready.

330
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,940
Oh, a chest tube too.

331
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,240
Yes, doctor.

332
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,559
Hello, this is Do Yun Wan.

333
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,859
It's been a long time.

334
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,799
Please don't say that.

335
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:39,140
I've returned safely
thanks to your concern.

336
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:41,869
Yes.

337
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,910
This morning?

338
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,680
Oh, dear. And?

339
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,279
To Doldam Hospital?

340
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,450
The Minister is here.

341
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,490
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

342
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,460
What are his vital signs?

343
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,230
His blood pressure
was 100 over 80 at first,

344
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,829
but it dropped to 80 over 40
on the way.

345
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:08,869
What about the saturation?

346
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,670
We've kept it full from 88 percent.

347
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,769
Insert an IV line on both
of his arms for warm saline.

348
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,000
Bring me a reservoir mask.

349
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,039
Yes, doctor.

350
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,609
Those new doctors
are quick to respond.

351
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,680
Don't you think so, Dr. Jung?

352
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,009
- What are you doing, Ah Reum?
- Yes, doctor.

353
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,849
Have a FAST ready too.

354
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:25,950
The patient is here!

355
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,819
What are his vital signs?

356
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:30,190
BP, 110 over 70.
HR, 115. It's comparably stable.

357
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,420
But he's suffering from the pains
in his right shoulder and leg.

358
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
Dr. Bae.

359
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,660
Yes, I'm coming.

360
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,660
Slowly.

361
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,470
We'll run an OP laboratory test as
soon as the IV lines are inserted.

362
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,640
Yes, doctor.

363
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,210
We'll cut your shirt open, sir.

364
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,210
It's way worse than I thought.

365
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,420
- What's his blood pressure now?
- It's 80 over 40.

366
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,180
Do you hear me, sir?

367
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,690
It might not be so easy.

368
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,930
If there's anything I need to know,

369
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,170
do explain it to me.

370
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,599
Is he taking any medication?

371
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,039
- Stand by at the gate.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,720
The sonograph is here.

373
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,400
It's a massive hemoperitoneum.

374
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,829
Both his liver and spleen
are damaged.

375
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,970
Let's check his chest too.

376
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,180
Checking BLUE protocol.
Seems normal.

377
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,910
And the PLAPS point...

378
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,519
(PLAPS: Posterolateral alveolar
or pleural syndrome)

379
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,579
There's bleeding.

380
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,450
A blunt injury, hemothorax,
hemoperitoneum,

381
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,920
unstable vitals,

382
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,759
and the patient
is the Minister of National Defense.

383
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,630
What a first day.

384
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,660
His saturation is dropping.

385
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,559
Minister. Minister?

386
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,170
I'll intubate.
Eun Jae, get a line ready.

387
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,839
You do it and I'll intubate.

388
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,970
There's no time to argue.

389
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,259
Seriously?
What's taking you so long?

390
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:04,569
I'm in.

391
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,109
Are you having issues?
Need me to step in?

392
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,079
You can take it out now.

393
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,420
Secure it at 21cm.

394
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,250
Have two packed RBC sent up
in case of an emergency...

395
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,559
and then prepare 10 more
as well as 10 packs of FFP.

396
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,319
- Yes, Doctor.
- Do you have a RIS?

397
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,390
- Yes, we do.
- Good.

398
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,829
We'll get a CT scan first then.

399
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,569
Forget the CT scan
and send him to the OR.

400
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,869
His BP and saturation dropped,
so Dr. Seo intubated.

401
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,009
The sonograph revealed
a hemothorax and hemoperitoneum.

402
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,019
We must open him up
and stop the bleeding first.

403
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,720
Without a CT scan?

404
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,250
No way.

405
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,759
Where's Dr. Nam?

406
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,660
He said he'll wait in the OR.

407
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,460
Ms. Oh, you should head there
right now...

408
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,160
and have the OR prepped.

409
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,259
Yes, Doctor.

410
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,799
I brought the blood.

411
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,140
You'll operate without
taking a CT scan first?

412
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,210
There's a higher chance
of him going into cardiac arrest...

413
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,170
while prepping him for a CT scan.

414
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,680
We can buy enough time...

415
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,279
by pumping him fresh blood.

416
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,220
Have you had to do
damage control before?

417
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,519
- No.
- Every second is vital here.

418
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,420
Dragging it out
by sticking to ever protocol...

419
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,720
will only end up killing him.

420
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,829
Mr. Park, transfer this patient
to the OR.

421
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,890
Woo Jin, you'll be backing me up.

422
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,900
You have five minutes to get ready
and meet me at the OR.

423
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,599
Go.

424
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,900
Yes, Doctor.

425
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,269
Dr. Yun?

426
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,009
And who are you?

427
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm second-year CS fellow
Cha Eun Jae...

428
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,750
who was transferred here yesterday.

429
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,609
I doubt you remember me, sir.

430
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,319
Have you treated
a hemothorax before?

431
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,049
Yes, of course.

432
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,289
I'm a second-year attending.

433
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,589
I have zero tolerance for those
who faint or doze off in an OR.

434
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,390
If I ever catch you in that state...

435
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,799
Speak up now if you can't do this.

436
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,400
No, I'm fine, sir. I can do it.

437
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,970
Then meet me at the OR
in five minutes too.

438
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,109
You are not to enter
unless I call you.

439
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,339
Yes, Doctor!

440
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,450
How did he know
that I collapsed in the OR?

441
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,619
It's fine that he knows,
but did he have to say it...

442
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,190
in front of everyone?

443
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,099
Darn it. Unbelievable.

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,170
Darn.

445
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,970
(Men's Room)

446
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,599
Are you joining the surgery too?

447
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,140
You think it'd only be you?

448
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,180
This time,

449
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:55,579
I won't carry you out.

450
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,589
This is driving me crazy.

451
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,700
It's your first surgery
at this hospital.

452
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,670
I hope we get along.

453
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,950
Nice to meet you, Dr. Seo.
I'm Nam Do Il.

454
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,420
Hi, I look forward
to working with you too.

455
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,720
I guess you're lucky
when it comes to work.

456
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,450
Can you believe that
your first operation here...

457
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,559
would be on the Minister?

458
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,319
Don't be too nervous though.

459
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,259
We're all veterans here.

460
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,279
(Operation Room, Elevator)

461
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,819
Where's the Minister?

462
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,779
He's in critical condition...

463
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,920
and is now in the OR.

464
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,549
You bring him to this dump
when he's in critical condition?

465
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,190
Stop the operation
and call a helicopter.

466
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,460
We will transfer him to Seoul.

467
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,730
Then he'll die en route.

468
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,569
I'm Master Kim of Doldam Hospital.

469
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,509
I just got off the phone
with Doctor Hong...

470
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,309
of the Seoul Military Hospital.

471
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,950
He also agreed on
the Minister's emergency surgery.

472
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:45,259
Yes, I ordered the men
to take the Minister there.

473
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,160
There's massive bleeding
in his abdomen.

474
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,559
Waiting any longer
will danger his life.

475
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,329
If you wish for him to live,

476
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,059
you'll let Master Kim
conduct the surgery.

477
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:57,769
That's your one and only option.

478
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,740
Shouldn't you head over
to Doldam Hospital?

479
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,549
Sir?

480
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,480
It's fine. Maybe I will later on.

481
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,750
But it's the Minister.

482
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,789
I also heard
he's in critical condition.

483
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,059
He won't be left to die though.

484
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,630
Boo Yong Joo...

485
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,230
would never pass up
on an opportunity like this.

486
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,940
Although, the surgery
seems like a tough one.

487
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,539
The Minister has angina.

488
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,779
He's been taking aspirin
for the past two years.

489
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:44,579
He'll be bleeding intensively
and hemostasis will be tricky.

490
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,220
Considering his age
and the risks of this surgery,

491
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,460
I'm not sure if I can...

492
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,490
ask you to do this.

493
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,309
Master Kim, it's the first operation
in the new OR.

494
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,180
Also, the first patient
is the Minister.

495
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,140
If this isn't a good sign for
the hospital, I don't know what is.

496
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,549
Don't get ahead of yourself.

497
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,150
Our first surgery
could be our very last.

498
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,519
What? I mean...

499
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,970
I'm curious.

500
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,900
Who will this surgery...

501
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,569
serve as an opportunity for?

502
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,289
(Alprazolam)

503
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,579
Due to massive trauma
to the abdomen,

504
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,849
he is suffering from
both a liver and spleen injury.

505
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,980
His BP is low
and his oxygen saturation level...

506
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,150
is unstable
because of the left hemothorax.

507
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,119
He could go into cardiac arrest
the moment we open him up.

508
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,019
Are you sure about this?

509
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,359
Today, we'll focus
on damage control first...

510
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,029
and then his bleeding.

511
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,630
After a splenectomy,

512
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,000
we'll do a perihepatic packing.

513
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,140
Then after we monitor him,
we'll conduct a second surgery...

514
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,369
within 48 hours.

515
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,769
You may begin.

516
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,410
He has massive bleeding
in the abdomen.

517
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,410
There will be blood everywhere.

518
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,150
Ms. Oh, prepare enough large tape...

519
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,420
and several abdominal suction tubes.

520
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,019
Scalpel.

521
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,960
Suction.

522
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,859
Bovie.

523
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
His BP is dropping.

524
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,609
Large tape.

525
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,549
Keep the suction going.

526
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,960
We finally have a visual.

527
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,690
We will wrap up
the splenectomy in five minutes.

528
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,599
- Fine minutes?
- Splenic artery.

529
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:47,930
Forceps.

530
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,000
Right angle.

531
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,869
Give me another.

532
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,069
Metz.

533
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:00,839
I didn't expect this level of speed.

534
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,410
Are you just going
to stand there and gawk?

535
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,049
Crile.

536
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,369
I'm sorry. Can I have another one?

537
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:35,239
I thought surgery
was your comfort zone.

538
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,380
Don't tell me that
this is all you've got.

539
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:41,619
Cut.

540
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,489
Clip.

541
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,159
Bovie.

542
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay.

543
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,010
Next, we'll move on to the liver.

544
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,349
Bovie.

545
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:18,650
My gosh. He has fast hands.

546
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,690
Why else would he be known
for having the hands of a deity?

547
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,599
Dr. Cha, you're requested in the OR.

548
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,940
There's too much bleeding.

549
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,610
His liver must nearly be severed.

550
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Bipolar forceps.

551
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,119
- Tie.
- I'll do it.

552
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,030
Cut.

553
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,400
Bipolar forceps.

554
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,809
Bovie.

555
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,750
Suture.

556
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,489
He's bleeding wherever we touch.

557
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:24,090
It's due to the aspirin he's taking.

558
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,719
Aspirin?

559
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:27,889
Cut.

560
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,860
A patient taking aspirin is now
suffering from a massive hemorrhage?

561
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,699
How am I supposed
to stop the bleeding?

562
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,099
Clip.

563
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,269
Smaller vessels won't be manageable
with clips though.

564
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,869
Spray topical hemostatic agents,

565
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,039
pack him up,

566
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,739
and then we'll stitch him up
during the second OR.

567
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,739
This is unheard of.

568
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:47,010
Am I just supposed
to follow his lead?

569
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,550
Gauze.

570
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,050
CS. Is the cardiac surgeon here?

571
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,250
Yes, I'm here.

572
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,250
Insert the tube.

573
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,019
Yes, Doctor.
Hand me the tube, please.

574
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:03,690
Scalpel.

575
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,429
You can do this, Eun Jae.
You've got this.

576
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,300
Kelly.

577
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,519
The amount?

578
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,860
600cc, Doctor.

579
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,929
600cc?

580
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,530
There must be another bleeder.

581
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,000
What should we do, Master Kim?

582
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,170
800cc.

583
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,480
(Elapsed time: 1 hour 30 minutes)

584
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,650
(Time under anesthesia:
1 hour 40 minutes)

585
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,880
What is he going to do? No way...

586
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:36,889
Master Kim.

587
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,519
Master Kim?

588
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,929
Is this surgery doomed?

589
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,170
The intercostal vessel.

590
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,739
(Intercostal vessels
are between the ribs.)

591
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,969
We'll open his chest.

592
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,969
Let's see from there.

593
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,469
But there are no indications...

594
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,639
It's the aspirin.

595
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,440
The blood won't clot.

596
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,980
We must save every drop we can.

597
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,880
Dr. Nam, vitals?

598
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,449
The transfusion's keeping up.

599
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,050
He's stable at about 80.

600
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,659
We'll position the patient
right semi-decubitus.

601
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:13,690
Okay.

602
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,889
(Right semi-decubitus: Positioning
the right side higher)

603
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,329
What? Everyone's going along
with this crazy operation?

604
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,590
Dr. Cha, are you all right?

605
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,429
I'm sorry. I'm...

606
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,230
Seo Woo Jin. Move.

607
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,780
Scalpel.

608
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,750
Retractor.

609
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,340
Suction.

610
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,110
Suction!

611
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,780
I found it.

612
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,920
No way.

613
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,619
It was intercostal vessel bleeding.

614
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,760
(Intercostal vessels
are between the ribs.)

615
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,889
This guy.

616
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,159
He's really insane.

617
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,159
Clip.

618
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,840
Dr. Cha.

619
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,239
Are you sick?

620
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,780
- Dr. Cha.
- I'm fine.

621
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,420
I'm okay.

622
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,440
Yes, he was transferred
to the ICU just a while ago.

623
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,170
Yes, it won't be easy.

624
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,079
Yes.

625
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,750
His vital signs aren't dropping
any more.

626
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,289
Watch him closely.

627
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,559
If his vital signs become unstable
even for a bit...

628
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,260
or he shows any unusual symptoms,
call me right away.

629
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,800
Call me right away.

630
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,199
Yes, doctor.

631
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,340
I'll keep checking on him too.

632
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,940
Okay. Please do that.

633
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,139
Okay.

634
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,949
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

635
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,789
How did it go
with the other patient?

636
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:35,420
Did you say
he's the Minister's aide?

637
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,730
Yes, according to the CT scan,

638
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,260
his spleen is slightly damaged,

639
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,130
but it doesn't seem
its capsule has ruptured.

640
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,260
The bleeding isn't
too serious either,

641
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,969
so we've decided to observe him
in the ICU for now.

642
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,570
The amount of bleeding could hike
all of a sudden.

643
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,469
Then we'll have to operate on him
right away, so watch him tightly.

644
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,969
- Yes, doctor.
- Thanks.

645
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,039
No problem.

646
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,789
I'm Jang Gi Tae.
Would you like some beverages?

647
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,260
It's for free.

648
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:09,929
Would you like some beverages?

649
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,289
No?

650
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,199
I'm Manager Jang Gi Tae.

651
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,159
Here.
The Minister will be all right.

652
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,699
Manager Jang! Can I have
a moment with you?

653
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,170
- What is the matter?
- Well...

654
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,199
You need to see this.

655
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,750
(GS Park Min Guk)

656
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,510
Hello, this is Park Min Guk
of Geodae Medical Center.

657
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,179
This is Do Yun Wan.

00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,750
Oh, hello.

659
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:38,550
How may I help you?

660
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,860
("Minister Ryu Woong Il of National
Defense Got into a Car Accident")

661
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,760
Yes, I'm reading it now.

662
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,130
It's not included in the article,

663
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,300
but the Minister is currently
at Doldam Hospital.

664
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,800
He was in critical condition,

665
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,309
so Boo Yong Joo operated on him.

666
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:03,550
But the Minister's aides...

667
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,219
are deeply worried.

668
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,289
What is it...

669
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,329
that you want to say?

670
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:19,400
I'd like...

671
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,730
to recommend you
as his doctor in charge...

672
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,639
since you're the most competent one
in Geodae Medical Center.

673
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:32,440
What do you think?

674
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,719
What are you doing here?

675
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,889
I told you to watch the patient
in the ICU closely.

676
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,159
What is it?

677
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,039
About your intercostal vessel
operation earlier...

678
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,309
How certain were you?

679
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:05,610
What are you saying?

680
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,409
It's the Minister, not some nobody.

681
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,780
You should've chosen a safer way.

682
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,449
I don't care whoever he is,

683
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:18,150
whatever he does,
or whatever position he's in.

684
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,460
He's just a patient to me the
moment he was brought into the OR.

685
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,760
I don't think about anything else.

686
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,690
I just have this one thing in mind.

687
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,030
"I will save him. I will save him
no matter what."

688
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,139
Does that mean you can do anything
as long as you can save him?

689
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:36,110
He left his life up to me
to survive.

690
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,809
So I should save him.

691
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,849
Is that why you conducted
that reckless operation?

692
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:44,380
What?

693
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,949
You found out that it was
intercostal vessel bleeding...

694
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:48,750
without even getting a CT scan.

695
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,349
It was all thanks
to your gut feeling and luck.

696
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:54,190
What if your gut feeling was wrong,
and you were unlucky?

697
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,130
What could've happened
to the Minister then?

698
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,460
What's with you?

699
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,429
Why are you suddenly
acting like you're a doctor?

700
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,940
I thought you only needed
to take 10,000 dollars.

701
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:08,599
I know.

702
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:11,909
I came all the way here
because of money,

703
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:14,710
but now that I watched
your operation,

704
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,679
I'm getting a little scared...

705
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,519
I might be holding
onto a rotten lifeline again.

706
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,650
Who says I'm your lifeline?

707
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,590
I haven't decided on anything yet.

708
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,329
Even a day hasn't passed...

709
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,260
of the week you promised.

710
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,130
And you haven't been able
to change my mind even for a bit.

711
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,170
You know that?

712
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:40,039
Thanks to my gut feeling and luck?

713
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,170
If that's all you saw,

714
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,539
it means you aren't
any better either.

715
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,150
What does that mean?

716
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,519
Find the answer yourself.

717
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,530
(Staff Only)

718
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,500
Good work.

719
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,570
You've gone through big trouble.

720
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,300
Oh, no.

721
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,269
I barely managed
to stop the bleeding.

722
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,869
You don't have to behave humble
even to me.

723
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,480
I know more than anyone else
just how skilled you are.

724
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,119
Oh, right. Did you meet the one
we talked about before?

725
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,849
Yes, he was in the OR with me today.

726
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,760
He's one talented guy.

727
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,889
I don't know. That could be
everything of that punk.

728
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,730
And it's our job...

729
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,599
to turn such a punk into a doctor.

730
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,670
I'll call you again.

731

("A Bankrupt 40-year-old Man
Commits Suicide with His Family")

son was taken to the hospital.)

Such a Drastic Decision?")

735
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,670
Please...

736
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,019
Dr. Cha.

737
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:16,059
What are you doing here?

738
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,889
Well, I came to see Master Kim.

739
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,000
- He's not in his office?
- Goodness, wait.

740
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,829
He's in his office,

741
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,030
but he seems a little busy
right now.

742
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,050
Why are you standing there?

743
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,989
You said you have something
to tell me.

744
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,659
Go ahead and tell me.

745
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,300
Well...

746
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,070
Actually,

747
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,000
I had an upset stomach...

748
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,300
because of the bread I had
in the morning.

749
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,409
I should've taken better care of me
before the surgery.

750
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,809
I apologize for my poor job
at the first operation.

751
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,880
I'm really sorry.

752
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,150
Well, you seem busy.

753
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,920
I'll get going now.

754
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,460
Why did you come here?

755
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,090
Pardon?

756
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,969
What kind of mistake did you make
that you got kicked out to here?

757
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,170
I didn't get kicked out.

758
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,639
There are two options
in which I can punish you.

759
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,239
Either be suspended...

760
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:39,369
or work off your suspension
at our branch hospital.

761
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,980
Our branch hospital?

762
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,250
Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.

763
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:46,250
I chose to come here.

764
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,780
Is that a habit of yours?

765
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,150
Why do you keep beating
around the bush...

766
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,860
instead of answering my question?

767
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,860
I've never done that.

768
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,840
Is it that hard
to admit to it honestly?

769
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:08,769
Why?

770
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,170
Would it hurt your pride
if you get caught?

771
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,039
Or are you worried
people might look down on you?

772
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,480
I don't understand what you mean.

773
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,349
Right, you don't.

774
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,949
And that explains your life.

775
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,559
From this moment on,
you're banned from my OR.

776
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,699
I can't operate with a doctor
who leaves her patient...

777
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,070
and runs out.

778
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,539
I already explained
that I had an upset stomach.

779
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,039
Don't even think
about making excuses.

780
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,610
Doctors should not bring
their personal issues into the OR.

781
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,449
I don't care if you were sick
or you vomited...

782
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,510
because of your anxiety issues.

783
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:54,880
You leaving your patient...

784
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,349
already disqualifies you
as a doctor.

785
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,519
A CS surgeon with issues like that?

786
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,090
You really think you're qualified
to cut open someone's heart?

787
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:06,900
Who are you trying to kill?

788
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,969
If you can't get over it,
just quit being a doctor.

789
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,500
Did you have to be so harsh?

790
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,900
You could've said it in a nicer way.

791
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,809
They're both menaces, that's why.

792
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,250
One only steps into an OR
to make money...

793
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,309
and the other...

794
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,320
runs out of the OR
leaving her patient on the table.

795
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:39,320
Young doctors these days...

796
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,659
won't learn if you push them hard.

797
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,989
They'll only call you old-fashioned.

798
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,500
So I should
sugarcoat my opinions...

799
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,400
just to receive a good review?

800
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:52,900
I won't do that.
I don't have the time for it either.

801
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,909
What if both doctors
pack up and leave?

802
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,510
Then I guess...

803
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,079
they weren't Doldam materials.

804
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,820
But it wasn't easy
bringing them here.

805
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:09,449
Am I wrong?

806
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,010
It's water.

807
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,380
Thanks, Dr. Yun.

808
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,050
This isn't who I am, you know.

809
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,260
You see,

810
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,690
I worked really hard to get here.

811
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,530
Ever since
I enrolled in medical school,

812
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,860
I haven't slept
for more than four hours a day.

813
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,199
When others ate
and then took a dump,

814
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,769
I kept on studying at the library
while suffering...

815
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,570
from constipation.

816
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,510
I've shed about a liter of blood
from my nose.

817
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,210
I worked my butt off
to graduate second in my class...

818
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,050
and finished third place
at the CS department.

819
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:15,679
But now,

820
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,360
after being kicked to
this dump of a small hospital,

821
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,219
I was told to quit being a doctor.

822
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,659
I doubt he truly meant it.

823
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,530
It's unfair.

824
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,570
I'm sorry for the time I wasted...

825
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,900
so that I could wear
a doctor's gown one day...

826
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:38,610
and I feel like all my hard work
has been for nothing.

827
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,039
You should say that.

828
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,079
Don't you know that
you're our role model?

829
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,050
Who is?

830
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,250
Me?

831
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,360
You know how Dr. Oh at CS
is an obnoxious sexist.

832
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,760
So watching you hold
your head up high beneath him...

833
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,130
taught us
to be half the doctor you are.

834
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:05,730
You have no idea how many
female doctors look up to you.

835
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,199
Also,

836
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,000
you were scouted by a genius.

837
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,710
Scouted?

838
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,079
By whom?

839
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,050
You don't know, do you?

840
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,420
You have no idea
who requested you here.

841
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:25,150
And here I thought
I finally had one decent attending.

842
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:28,019
She may be a woman,

843
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:30,630
but she's smarter
than most of the other guys.

844
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,730
She received good grades too.

845
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,199
Her research paper
is even better than some professors.

846
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,099
It's beyond me why she gets tense
in the OR.

847
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,969
She's a second-year fellow, right?

848
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,969
How about you send her over to me?

849
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,550
What use do you have
for a surgeon who can't operate?

850
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,579
If she ends up causing trouble
in the OR,

851
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,949
she'll have to give up her license.

852
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,920
- So send her to me.
- Gosh.

853
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,260
No way.

854
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:07,760
It's true.

855
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,699
I heard them talk.

856
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,539
They'll leave, right?

857
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,340
Dr. Seo or Dr. Cha?

858
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,670
Both.

859
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,210
Why do you think they'll quit?

860
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,650
Young people these days...

861
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,480
hate condescending old people
like Master Kim.

862
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:30,590
They hate to be corrected
and hate being told what to do.

863
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,820
Most of them draw a line
and never go the extra mile.

864
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:38,059
That's not always the case.

865
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:41,099
Some young doctors
are hardworking and devoted.

866
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,800
Dr. Seo...

867
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,530
has fast hands and a good attitude.

868
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Right?

869
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,449
So here you are.
I've been looking for you.

870
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,920
Me?

871
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,119
Yes. Here.

872
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,050
It's the medication
for pain and inflammation.

873
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,960
I was told to give you this.

874
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,889
By whom?

875
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,760
I don't know. I was asked
not to tell by Master Kim.

876
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,000
(Medication)

877
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,539
Dr. Seo,

878
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,380
I already gave a note
to the X-ray department.

879
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,510
Go ahead and take one of your chest.

880
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,110
An X-ray?

881
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,420
I was told to see
if you have any broken ribs.

882
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,750
By whom?

883
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:38,920
Master Kim.

884
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,360
He said you were in pain
during the operation.

885
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,730
(Doctor's Office, Master Kim)

886
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:04,380
Thanks to my gut feeling and luck?

887
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,880
If that's all you saw,

888
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,219
it means you aren't
any better either.

889
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:12,219
What does that mean?

890
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,960
Find the answer yourself.

891
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,969
(Doldam Hospital)

892
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,079
(Doldam Hospital)

893
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,280
(Emergency Medical Center)

894
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,820
Of course I'm fine.

895
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,690
The hospital isn't as bad
as I thought it would be.

896
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,360
What? What about my voice?

897
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,960
Don't be absurd. I didn't cry.

898
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,000
You know how it's colder
at night in the countryside.

899
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,369
It must be why
I have a stuffy nose.

900
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,570
Of course I'm fine.

901
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,309
I operated on the Minister
on my first day of work.

902
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,849
The doctors here...

903
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:47,880
are already claiming
that I'm irreplaceable.

904
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,119
Mom, I should go.
I'll call back later.

905
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:54,489
Which one do you want?

906
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,730
Coffee with milk and sugar.

907
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,230
(Milk coffee)

908
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:05,929
And the queasiness.

909
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:08,000
Are you better now?

910
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,469
Yes, of course. I'm good.

911
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,719
Do you want to take it first?

912
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,320
No, thanks.
I only drink black coffee.

913
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,360
(Black coffee)

914
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:44,809
Bye then.

915
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,710
Bye.

916
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,010
Hey.

917
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:53,349
Master Kim.

918
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,480
What do you think he's like?

919
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,019
I was told to give you this
by Master Kim.

920
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:02,219
Go ahead and take one of your chest.

921
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,659
- By whom?
- Master Kim.

922
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:08,659
Who cares what he's like?

923
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:10,500
I just need to make money.

924
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,969
- Why do you ask?
- Out of curiosity.

925
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,809
Is he just an ill-tempered
old man or...

926
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:20,840
Or what?

927
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,449
Never mind. See you.

928
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,309
Dr. Seo, you should come over.

929
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,679
Who's here?

930
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,380
Someone called Park Min Guk is here
from Geodae Medical Center.

931
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,750
But he didn't come alone.

932
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,530
Professor.

933
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,420
Nice to meet you.

934
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:42,090
I'm surgeon Park Min Guk
from Geodae Medical Center.

935
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,059
So what?

936
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,260
You haven't heard anything yet...

937
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,599
from Chairman Do?

938
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:55,539
I think he means
President Do Yun Wan.

939
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:57,909
What about him?

940
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,510
What did he say?

941
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,110
As of this moment,

942
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,949
he put me in charge of everything
regarding Minister Ryu.

943
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,380
Did he say that...

944
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,949
he'll transfer to you...

945
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,489
a patient I operated on
without my approval?

946
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:17,289
Yes. I said that.

947
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,469
It's been a while.

948
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,039
How've you been?

949
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:36,039
Gosh, you slimy little thing.

950
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:41,019
You really came back.

951
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,619
I said I would.

952
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:46,150
You got kicked out in disgrace.

953
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:49,260
You should've moved somewhere
to live in hiding.

954
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,230
Why come back here
when there's nothing to take?

955
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,730
Are you that bored?

956
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,960
I returned because
there's a lot to do.

957
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,230
But then,

958
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,670
what would the likes of you know?

959
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,300
You don't know how to
coexist with power,

960
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:04,710
or how to coexist with politics.

961
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,269
But I know very well...

962
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,039
who stuck a straw
in someone else's back...

963
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,079
just to live like a parasite.

964
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,489
Watch your language.

965
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,360
I'm the chairman
of Geodae Foundation's board.

966
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:23,059
What did he say?

967
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,230
- He's the chairman of the board.
- What?

968
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,400
Chairman of the board.

969
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,960
Chairman of the board?

970
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,230
So what about it?

971
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,440
What am I to do about that?

972
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,440
As of this moment,

973
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:44,380
all medical treatment
regarding Minister Ryu...

974
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,320
will be done by
Professor Park Min Guk.

975
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,519
No one from Doldam Hospital...

976
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,460
is allowed to get in his way.

977
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,059
If you disobey,

978
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,130
you will be reprimanded accordingly.

979
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,099
What if, as his doctor,

980
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,469
I do not agree with that?

981
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,239
Your agreement isn't needed.

982
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,309
You just follow my instructions.

983
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,909
If you don't want to, leave.

984
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:18,309
Which is it?

985
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,949
Your livelihood...

986
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,050
or your pride?

987
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,530
Dr. Nam.

988
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:43,269
- Dr. Nam
- What is it?

989
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,010
Well... Cars from all sorts of
media outlets passed by.

990
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,250
Journalists?

991
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:53,579
Are they shooting a drama nearby?

992
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,019
They were headed to...

993
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,050
Doldam Hospital.

994
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:00,789
Doldam...

995
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,500
It's a member of staff!

996
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:11,070
- Stop her!
- Excuse me!

997
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,000
How is the minister?
Please say something.

998
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,340
- How is Minister Ryu?
- Is it true he's still here?

999
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,969
Is it true that Minister Ryu
is at Doldam Hospital?

1000
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:19,570
How badly was he hurt?

1001
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,340
Is it true he had surgery?

1002
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,280
How gravely injured was he?

1003
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,510
(Emergency Medical Center)

1004
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,610
(Doldam Hospital)

1005
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,980
BP is stable at 90 over 60,

1006
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:31,489
but his temperature's up to 38.9℃.

1007
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,320
Urine?

1008
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,320
10 to 15cc per hour.

1009
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:36,690
Put him on propacetamol...

1010
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,030
and get a chest portable.

1011
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:39,960
Keep checking his input,
output, and temperature.

1012
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,730
- I'll get Master Kim.
- Okay.

1013
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,469
Seo Woo Jin?

1014
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:52,739
You're down here?

1015
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,409
What brings you here?

1016
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:59,010
I'm the minister's doctor now.

1017
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,449
I'm sorry but...

1018
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:06,320
I've heard nothing yet.

1019
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,519
It was just decided.
You'll hear about it downstairs.

1020
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,230
Hand things over to Dr. Yang
and step aside.

1021
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,300
Until the operating surgeon says so,

1022
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,369
I cannot leave the patient.

1023
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:21,539
Hey. Seo Woo Jin.

1024
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,770
Doctor. His BP is dropping.

1025
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,210
Didn't you hear the professor?

1026
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,510
He's in charge of
the minister's treatment now.

1027
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,449
You can back down.

1028
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,149
I can't leave until
the operating surgeon says so!

1029
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:39,750
What's wrong with you?

1030
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,829
(Doldam Hospital)

1031
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:48,899
There are reporters and cars
all over the place. What now?

1032
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,699
They're asking how the Minister is.

1033
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:52,970
Master Kim.

1034
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:55,869
Did you call them?

1035
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,439
Wait and see.
It'll get really exciting.

1036
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,510
What should I do?

1037
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,579
Master Kim!

1038
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,289
How is Minister Ryu right now?

1039
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,829
(Epilogue)

1040
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:58,729
Do you want to take it first?

1041
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:00,399
No, thanks.
I only drink black coffee.

1042
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:03,739
This time,

1043
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,869
I won't carry you out.

1044
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:11,880
Cha Eun Jae.

1045
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,689
Darn it. Will you wake up?

1046
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,640
Bye then.

1047
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,640
Bye.

1048
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:06,270
(Dr. Romantic 2)

1049
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,539
People of Doldam. Those jerks
insist on fighting us head-on.

1050
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,010
Professor. Here...

1051
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:14,510
- Why you...
- Don't!

1052
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,909
Dig into Cha Eun Jae.

1053
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:18,479
I think you and I can
go back to Geodae Medical Center.

1054
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,220
Will you really let them
take the Minister?

1055
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,750
Will you be responsible
if something goes wrong?

1056
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,550
Can you save him?

1057
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,119
Will you really not return with me?

1058
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:29,159
What Do Yun Wan never considered.

1059
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,520
We must use it.

1060
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,590
Do Yun Wan already knows...

1061
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,659
everything about you
and Doldam Hospital.

1062
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:36,729
There are things he doesn't know.
