(The Age of Hatred)

2
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,920
The age of hatred.

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,780
(Get lost.)

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,789
Didn't you know?

5
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,990
He became an outcast
for whistleblowing.

6
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,829
Lines are drawn
just for having different opinions.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,560
There was a rumor that
you worked as a gigolo.

8
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,500
You're belittled and made fun of.

9
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,500
I'd rather not drag this out.

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,069
Find another place to work.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,939
You have no dignity as a doctor.

12
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,670
You're just a cheap jerk
who only cares about money.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,069
You go against my principles.

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,480
You're insulted
for no particular reason.

15
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,980
You'd better leave after you're done
taking care of the patient...

16
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,019
that just got taken to the OR.

17
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,489
Due to collective egoism...

18
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,319
and a dichotomous view of the world,

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,459
you're either friends
on the same side or foes.

20
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:28,989
The world is seen
in black and white.

21
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,400
(A black and white world)

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Eun Jae.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,829
Do you seriously want
to lose your license?

24
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,700
Respect for others
is thrown out the window.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,000
This is why I don't hire girls.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,969
It has become a world
filled with disrespect and hatred.

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,510
But just then...

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,980
What should I do?

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,010
- How is Minister Ryu right now?
- Doctor!

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,230
A man suddenly appeared
out from the smoke.

31
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,930
How about you send her over to me?

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,830
What use do you have
for a surgeon who can't operate?

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,270
Why don't you find someone else?

34
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,379
His reputation within
the hospital is just terrible.

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,680
The thing is,

36
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:23,580
I need money.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,449
In my whole life,

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,949
I never judged anyone with a price.

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,550
You said you need help!

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,590
What I need is a doctor!

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,830
What does that mean?

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,889
Find...

43
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,000
the answer yourself.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,250
(Episode 3:
Undefined Setting Value)

45
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,050
(Episode 3)

46
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,990
Minister Ryu Woong Il
got into a car accident...

47
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,300
on his way to Gangwon Province
to attend the joint military drill.

48
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,439
His driver, Park, suddenly
had a myocardial infarction.

49
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,599
And the car ended up
deviating from the road...

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,909
- His driver died on the spot.
- which led to a big accident.

51
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,680
And his assistant, Lee,
and the Minister himself...

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,780
got seriously injured.

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,210
After he received surgery
at Doldam Hospital,

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,949
he was moved
to an intensive care unit.

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,849
The hospital has announced that
the doctors are doing their best...

56
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,560
to treat Minister Ryu's
critical condition.

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,189
Minister Ryu's family hasn't arrived
at the hospital yet.

58
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,430
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense
announced that they plan...

59
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,000
to transfer him
to an armed forces hospital...

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,569
once his condition improves.

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,169
You don't need to worry too much.

62
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,740
Dr. Park Min Guk...

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,870
is known as the best surgeon
in his field.

64
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,710
Now that we're in charge
of taking care of Minister Ryu,

65
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,050
I believe our best doctor should be
the one to treat him.

66
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,050
Thank you. We hope you do your best.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,060
- There are no changes in the chart.
- No.

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,730
You should continue
to keep an eye on him.

69
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,829
- Okay, doctor.
- Okay.

70
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,019
BP is stable at 90 over 60,

71
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,519
but his temperature's up to 38.9℃.

72
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,519
Urine?

73
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,519
10 to 15cc per hour.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,290
Put him on propacetamol
and get a chest portable.

75
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,259
Keep checking his input,
output, and temperature.

76
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,860
- I'll get Master Kim.
- Okay.

77
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,500
Seo Woo Jin?

78
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,639
You're down here?

79
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,540
What brings you here?

80
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,980
I'm the minister's doctor now.

81
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,319
I'm sorry but...

82
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,089
I've heard nothing yet.

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,189
It was just decided.
You'll hear about it downstairs.

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,529
Hand things over to Dr. Yang
and step aside.

85
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,699
Until the operating surgeon says so,

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,899
I cannot leave the patient.

87
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:27,970
Hey.

88
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,000
Seo Woo Jin.

89
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,300
Doctor. His BP is dropping.

90
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,509
Didn't you hear the professor?

91
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,550
He's in charge of
the minister's treatment now.

92
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,480
You can back down.

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,079
I can't leave until
the operating surgeon says so!

94
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,649
What's wrong with you?

95
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,550
Doctor, he's having
a cardiac arrest!

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
My gosh.

97
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,870
This is a declaration of war,
Master Kim.

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,769
We need to come up
with a countermeasure.

99
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,370
How about we prepare
an official briefing...

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,480
regarding the minister?

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,410
Then we'll at least be able to deal
with the press that's outside.

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,779
You mean we should strike first?
I'm totally up for that.

103
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,449
Before Chairman Do
takes any kind of action,

104
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,660
we should make an announcement
regarding his current condition...

105
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,589
and our future plans for treatment.

106
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,899
Yes, Master Kim speaking.

107
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,019
Let me check.

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,189
That's a PEA. Let's continue.

109
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,750
(PEA: Pulseless Electrical Activity)

110
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,589
Here's the ABGA.

111
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,660
(ABGA: Arterial Blood Gas Analysis)

112
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,930
"Metabolic acidosis."

113
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,230
(Metabolic acidosis: An imbalance
in the body's acid-base balance)

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,730
Give him bicarbonate.

115
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,439
(Bicarbonate)

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,339
Use another tube.

117
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm Park Min Guk,
a GS surgeon from Geodae.

118
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,779
As of this moment,
I'm the doctor in charge.

119
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,310
Do as I say and get another tube!

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,779
- Okay, doctor.
- I'll do it, sir.

121
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,149
How long has it been?

122
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
About two minutes, sir.

123
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,350
Ho Jun, take over.

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,519
Okay, sir.

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,389
I'll do it.

126
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,689
Didn't you hear him?
It's been over two minutes!

127
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,990
I said I'll do it!

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,259
That's enough. Let him take over.

129
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,910
I told you to let him take over.

130
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:05,720
What happened?

131
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,860
He has a cardiac arrest.

132
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,189
His urine stopped coming out
due to hypovolemia.

133
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,129
And he also seems
to have metabolic acidosis.

134
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,500
I just ordered the nurse
to give him bicarbonate.

135
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,170
I'll take over now.

136
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,240
You may leave.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,870
- Ms. Oh.
- Yes?

138
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,610
Get me a staple remover
and No.10 blade.

139
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,639
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Please don't complicate things.

141
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,079
Get out of the way.

142
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,120
Will you take responsibility
if anything goes wrong?

143
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,889
Are you sure you can save his life?

144
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,220
That's what you should've asked me.

145
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,029
Don't you agree, Dr. Park?

146
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,529
Everything's ready, Master Kim.

147
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,000
Let him take over.

148
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,970
Okay, sir.

149
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,009
Betadine.

150
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,679
Staple remover.

151
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Keep going!

152
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
Okay, sir.

153
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,139
Scalpel.

154
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,480
What is he trying to do?

155
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,179
Stop.

156
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,470
What's he doing?

157
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,539
Tell him to stop right now!

158
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,110
Master Kim is doing his best.

159
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,409
Please trust him.
He's going to save his life.

160
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,200
It's too weak.

161
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,940
Can you squeeze the packed RBC?

162
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,169
I'll do it.

163
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,190
Sir.

164
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,259
His heart is beating again.

165
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,299
Master Kim, his heartbeat
is back to normal.

166
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,480
My legs...

167
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,700
Good work.

168
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,990
Dr. Shim?

169
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,019
Who are you?

170
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,389
Second-year CS fellow Cha Eun Jae.

171
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,830
I was transferred here
from Geodae yesterday.

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,460
Is this the staff room?

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,840
What brought you here, Dr. Shim?

175
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,539
Whose is that pillow?

176
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,879
It's mine.

177
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,740
- Can I take this bed?
- Oh, yes.

178
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,620
My back's killing me.

179
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,519
It'll be a rough few days.

180
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,419
You won't sleep?

181
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,159
I'm fine. You can go ahead.

182
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,059
You should sleep when you can
for your own good.

183
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,539
Give me that.

184
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,610
Here you go.

185
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,480
Oh, yes. This is perfect.

186
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,210
Dr. Park Min Guk?

187
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,639
It's done now.

188
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,840
Keep a close eye on him.

189
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,480
If his vitals change even a little,
or something's wrong, call me.

190
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,580
I will.

191
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,519
You did well, Dr. Seo.

192
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,190
Good job.

193
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,500
Good job, Dr. Seo.

194
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,429
All I did was panic
and get flustered.

195
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,169
You kept our patient safe...

196
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,639
until Master Kim got here.

197
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,779
You did a great job.

198
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,919
I'll send Mr. Park up.

199
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,320
Don't overdo it and get some rest.

200
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,370
You truly are amazing.

201
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,840
To be honest, I was moved.

202
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,580
In my life, I witnessed...

203
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,409
three open-heart massages.

204
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,710
This was the first time
the patient was revived.

205
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,690
I was lucky.

206
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,490
We aren't in the clear just yet.

207
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,460
When you have such great skills,

208
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,889
why work at a nameless
country hospital?

209
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,759
Why is this place nameless?

210
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,000
Didn't you see the sign outside
that says "Doldam Hospital"?

211
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,339
Do you have Schweitzer syndrome?

212
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,809
If not, there's no other way
to explain this.

213
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,339
You're the only triple board
certified doctor in Korea.

214
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,650
Why would you remain
in a countryside hospital?

215
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,089
You're not amassing a fortune
or gaining fame either.

216
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,890
It's because patients need me.

217
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,829
Is that really all there is?

218
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,730
Does a doctor need something else...

219
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,170
other than their patients?

220
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,269
For a long time,
I was very curious...

221
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,809
as to what you were like.

222
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,509
I said I'd come here...

223
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,410
because I wanted to
meet you in person.

224
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,710
Now that I did,

225
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,549
I think you're one or the other.

226
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:03,750
You're crazy...

227
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,230
or you're a chronic liar.

228
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't believe in
good-will without a price.

229
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,940
I've never seen such a thing.

230
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,309
Since it's late at night,

231
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,079
you should go to bed.

232
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,599
I heard he was a monster.

233
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,500
The rumors aren't all wrong.

234
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,829
We'll see when we take off his mask.

235
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,400
Whether he's a true monster...

236
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,539
or a snob pretending to be
a monster.

237
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,529
My gosh, what a jerk.

238
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,730
He's the worst jerk I've ever seen.

239
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,730
It's a common symptom in
high-flying doctors his age.

240
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,170
It's excessive confidence.

241
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,470
I hate him.

242
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,470
I'd love to slap him in the head
to put him in place.

243
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,009
Why did you get so violent?

244
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,339
I don't know. It must be menopause.
I feel hot.

Hello,

298
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,299
I am Dr. Park Min Guk
from Geodae Medical Center.

299
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,000
As you already heard,
the Minister of National Defense...

300
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,740
suffered injuries from
a car accident...

301
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,410
and was admitted here at Doldam,
a branch hospital of Geodae's

302
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,910
His condition
was too grave for him...

303
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,579
to be transported to Seoul,

304
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,009
and so his first surgery
took place at this hospital.

305
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,049
However, he is still
in critical condition,

306
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,420
which is why a second surgery
will be performed on him today.

Why is no one
taking any action though?

317
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,859
Don't take it up with me.

and doing my job.

because it's the minister?

320

Of course.

- This isn't how you were.

331
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,529
Just go back to who
you always have been.

332
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,099
You're confusing people
by turning over a new leaf.

333
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,740
Besides, all decisions
are made by those above us.

334
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:23,170
You should just stick
to what you're asked to do.

335
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,579
Just let them be.

336
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,190
Just let them be?

337
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,720
Of course.

338
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,519
Why stop them
from taking the harder route?

339
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:45,500
It's nice to have
some free time on my hands.

340
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,599
Are you...

341
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,769
avoiding the situation?

342
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,000
Let's say that I'm observing.

343
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,869
How is this a case
for you to just observe?

344
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,309
Why are you being all dramatic?

345
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,319
Didn't you agree
to only stay for a week here?

346
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,819
No, you're supposed to
re-evaluate our deal after a week.

347
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,759
That's only when
you've successfully convinced me.

348
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,990
However,

349
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,029
you're not even close yet.

350
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,569
Are you really going
to let them take your patient?

351
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:27,539
Don't worry too much.
They're all good doctors too.

352
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,140
It turns out that one of them
even studied at Johns Hopkins.

353
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,039
I doubt elite doctors like them...

354
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,509
would stick in a needle
the wrong way.

355
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,420
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

356
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,579
I'm done.

357
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,250
Oh, I see.

358
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:46,289
Mr. Park, you should
get some shut-eye too.

359
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,089
You probably had
to stay up all night.

360
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,430
Gosh.

361
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,369
For the first time in months,
I'm able to get a good nap.

362
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,769
Dr. Seo, unless
I'm most definitely needed,

363
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,640
don't wake me up.

364
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,779
Goodness.

365
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,450
What is this? Why the
sudden change in his attitude?

366
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,420
Am I the only one who's baffled?

367
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,720
I understand your frustration.

368
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,930
Then why aren't you doing
anything about it?

369
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,559
Because it's what
Master Kim decided.

370
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,269
When he makes up his mind,

371
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,700
we're supposed to just follow?

372
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,440
Are we all his puppets here?

373
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,410
It's not because
we don't have our own opinions.

374
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,140
We follow his decision
out of respect.

375
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,369
(Doldam Hospital)

376
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,539
Why the sudden change
in operating surgeons?

377
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,049
From what I gathered,
Dr. Boo has put...

378
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,220
many lives at risk
due to his recklessness in surgery.

379
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,490
Is that why
he's been taken off the case?

380
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,119
As of this moment,
all I can say is that...

381
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,630
we'll do our best to successfully
perform the second surgery.

382
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,700
A more detailed briefing
of the surgery...

383
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,130
will be delivered after it is over.

384
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,369
Good day.

385

(Dr. Park Will Perform
Minister Ryu's 2nd Surgery)

386
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,109
Reporter Choi, it's me.

387
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,609
That question was quite a blow.

388
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,519
Of course not. You did well.

389
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,220
That's how reporters should be.

390
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,029
You can never dig out the truth
with a dull knife.

391
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,329
Free your schedule someday.

392
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,599
I'll treat you to someplace nice.

393
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,430
Yes, of course.

394
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,240
I'll await your call.

395
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,180
Dr. Park?

396
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,420
What is this game you're playing?

397
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,089
You're not a member
of this hospital.

398
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,859
Who do you think you are...

399
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,630
holding a press conference
outside the hospital?

400
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,460
Also, on whose authority...

401
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,059
are you replacing Master Kim
as the operating surgeon?

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,069
And you are?

403
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:44,569
I'm Oh Myung Sim,
Doldam's head nurse.

404
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,170
This isn't an issue
for a head nurse to be involved in.

405
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,670
I know.

406
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,339
Normally, a head nurse
wouldn't be the advocate.

407
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,410
However,

408
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,549
what's happening right now...

409
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,250
seems like rubbish, Dr. Park.

410
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,049
- Hold on...
- Ms. Oh,

411
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,119
please calm down.

412
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,859
You may call it a second surgery,

413
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,690
but all that needs to be done...

414
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,059
is suture
once he stops hemorrhaging.

415
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,670
You're barely doing anything
to a patient...

416
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,400
Master Kim saved,

417
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,539
but I'm sure...

418
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,740
you'll take the credit for it.
Am I wrong?

419
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,910
Ms. Oh!

420
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,609
Tell me if I'm wrong.

421
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,779
You're right.

422
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,450
It's why I had the press conference.

423
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,049
May I get going now?

424
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,890
This way, Dr. Park.

425
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,759
- That jerk...
- Ms. Oh, please calm down.

426
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,359
- How dare he!
- Gosh.

427
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,759
- Please don't.
- Unbelievable.

428
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,029
Can you believe it?

(Doctor's Office,
Head of GS, Master Kim)

431
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,789
My fellow Doldam people,
those vultures outside...

432
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,789
have decided to take us
on a full-fledged war.

433
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,730
We will no longer
let them have their way.

434
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,469
I don't care if they're from Geodae.

435
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,940
For no plausible reason or cause,

436
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:29,469
they can't belittle us
or treat us with disrespect.

437
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,210
Now, the barbarians
have gone as far...

438
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,079
as to intercept one of our patients.

439
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,179
We will not let this slide.

440
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,750
You know what Doldam stands for.

441
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,349
It's a hospital that accommodates
anyone who needs medical assistance.

442
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,789
We even open on the holidays
and it never closes at night.

443
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:47,619
- For our patients...
- I bet that Ms. Joo likes Mr. Park.

444
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,960
- What?
- But Mr. Park...

445
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,159
is obviously married to the job.

446
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,130
He's a high horse to climb.

447
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,570
What are you talking about?

448
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,599
- Hush.
- Their impudence...

449
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,070
- will not be tolerated.
- You should keep your voice down.

450
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,340
As of this moment,
we will not allow them...

451
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,869
to access our patients' files...

452

to basic checkup charts,

455

any access to them.

- Yes, Ms. Oh.

Meanwhile, Ms. Uhm's love life
is in a pickle.

460
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,389
Maybe there was an argument.

00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,349
I apologize.

472
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,849
Ms. Oh seems to lack estrogen,
doesn't she?

473
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,389
What?

474
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,329
So? You still don't have
the surgical reports?

475
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,630
I've asked for them countless times,

476
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,559
but they won't hand them to me.

477
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,329
- Sorry.
- No can do.

478
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,829
I'm afraid I can't help you.

479
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,039
Hold on.

480
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,969
They won't even though
the minister's doctor ordered them?

481
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:12,340
The Minister's doctor?
Are you talking about Master Kim?

482
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,340
We only take orders from Master Kim.

483
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,250
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

484
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,920
Don't they know that
Dr. Park is his doctor now?

485
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,449
Of course, they do.
They just won't acknowledge it.

486
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,719
Do they all want to get fired?

487
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,289
The staff at this hospital
is as thick as the walls here.

Yes, Doctor. Yes?

489
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:41,340
Yes, I'll be there in five minutes.

00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,440
- Is that Dr. Park?
- He's headed to the Minister.

491
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,079
Unbelievable.

492
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,039
Don't you know anyone here?

493
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,380
Using connections is the best option
at times like this.

494
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,949
How would I know anyone
at this darn hospital?

495
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,190
Bae Mun Jung?

496
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:00,989
Dr. Yang Ho Jun?

497
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,579
Dr. Cha Eun Jae?

498
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,980
How's the patient?

499
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,960
His BP, heart-rate,
and O2 saturation level are stable.

500
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,519
His temperature is elevated,
but it's nothing to be alarmed by.

501
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,659
His brain CT scan was clean.

502
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,059
I'll have to check
his follow-up lab results,

503
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,960
but he's stable enough...

504
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,570
go through surgery again.

505
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,039
Please let me know
once you have those results.

506
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:20,900
Doctor,

507
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,570
you've never taken over
another doctor's patient.

508
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,409
We'll perform the surgery
if the results come back clean.

509
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,579
Grab an OR and call me.

510
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,789
Doctor, here you go.

511
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,000
(Surgical Report)

512
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,070
Do you know someone
in the CS department at Geodae?

513
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,269
CS?

514
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,739
Yes, one.

515
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,039
Then ask about
second-year fellow Cha Eun Jae.

516
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,309
Cha Eun Jae?

517
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,210
About her personality...

518
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,849
and why she was sent to Doldam.

519
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,489
Yes, sir.

520
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,130
Hey. Why? What's going on?

521
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,110
Sit down.

522
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,880
We should be allies.

523
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,579
What are you mumbling on about?

524
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:38,780
Join me as an ally.

525
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,820
I can't hear you with that mask on.

526
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,619
Darn it.

527
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,289
This is giving me abstract vibes.

528
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,059
I swear it's not
what I was going for.

529
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,929
Cut the cheekiness and listen up.

530
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,400
This is really important to us.

531
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,869
What's so important?

532
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,269
If we're lucky, you and I
might be able to...

533
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,510
return to Geodae Medical Center.

534
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,780
What do you mean?

535
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,849
Were you present at
Minister Ryu's surgery?

536
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,519
Oh, yes, I was.

537
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:16,820
I was with him
since he came into the ER.

538
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,019
Okay. That's great.

539
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:22,019
The minister is scheduled
for the second operation today.

540
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,989
I could do with someone
who was in the first one.

541
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,530
Oh, I see.

542
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,429
No.

543
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,030
Will you hear me out first?

544
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:36,309
This surgery will be
so important to Dr. Park.

545
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,409
You and I get to assist him
in that important surgery.

546
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:43,250
In return, our condition is that
he takes us back to Geodae.

547
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,880
- What do you say?
- Do it if you want. I'm out.

548
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,690
I'd go in alone if I could.

549
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,420
But as you know, I left the OR
halfway through the surgery.

550
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,130
Fine.

551
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,500
I'll forgive you for the atrocity...

552
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,400
you did to my face.

553
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,869
I said no, Eun Jae! I won't do it.

554
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,940
You're so frustrating.

555
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:08,539
This is an opportunity
for you too, Woo Jin.

556
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,539
Nothing bad will come from...

557
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,309
getting on Dr. Park's good side.

558
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,079
I don't need to get on
his good side.

559
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,809
You said you need money.

560
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,820
Wouldn't they
pay you more at Geodae?

561
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,250
Let's go back together.

562
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,150
We have a shot at it.

563
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,789
Is everything that easy for you?

564
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,530
What are you talking about?

565
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,929
You think you're
the smartest in the world.

566
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,900
Not knowing you're the stupidest.

567
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,869
Hey. Is there a smart idiot like me?

568
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,929
Didn't you know?

569
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,539
There are idiots
like you everywhere.

570
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,010
Idiots who only study
and like being in first place,

571
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,809
when they know nothing about life.

572
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,539
Idiots who think
they're the smartest.

573
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,539
That's enough.

574
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,710
Any more and it's defamation.

575
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,550
Call it friendly advice.

576
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,550
"Friendly"?

577
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,119
Since when were we friends?

578
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,820
Since when did you
think so much of me...

579
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,590
to give me such advice?

580
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,030
Go and wash your face.

581
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,539
You look weird.

582
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,380
Hello, Dr. Seo.

583
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,949
What a cool guy.

584
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,150
Seo Woo Jin, stop where you are!

585
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,090
Hey. Dr. Cha.

586
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,260
On your face...

587
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,829
- Is that mold?
- You're mistaken. It's atopy.

588
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,630
Atopy? That's so different.

589
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,769
(Staff lounge)

590
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,070
Mr. Park.

591
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,050
Excuse me.

592
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,789
Okay. I'll report back.

593
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,000
Sir, I'll do an ultrasound.

594
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,750
It looks like the capsule burst.

595
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,050
The abdominal cavity's...

596
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,420
Put him on a drip of...

597
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,349
100ml of saline
with 50ml of pethidine.

598
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:37,489
Yes, doctor.

599
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,420
It's Jung In Soo, sir.

600
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:43,030
The spleen injury patient
admitted to the ICU yesterday.

601
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,460
The minister's secretary.

602
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,659
His vitals suddenly worsened.

603
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,030
Dr. Seo did a sonogram.

604
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,329
There's severe abdominal bleeding.

605
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,469
We'll get things ready.

606
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,300
Take him to the OR immediately.

607
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,840
- Let's move him.
- Okay.

608
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,269
Sir, we'll transport you.

609
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,309
Hang in there.

610
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,079
What's wrong?

611
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,510
His condition suddenly worsened.

612
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,650
It looks like he needs
emergency surgery.

613
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,619
Sir. The minister will be
taken into the OR in five minutes.

614
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:22,159
Two stay here. The rest to the OR.

615
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,530
I'll stay with the minister.

616
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,599
Yes, sir.

617
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,690
That dirtbag.

618
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,110
Why do you keep following me?

619
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,079
I have nothing to say to you.

620
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,250
I'm going to get changed.

621
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,650
To wear my scrubs.

622
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,440
Hey, you.

623
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Must you really scrub in?

624
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:47,079
Yes. I will.

625
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,389
You asked what Master Kim is like.

626
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,389
So? What do you think he's like?

627
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,320
I think...

628
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,130
he's scary.

629
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,500
Is that why you shrank away?
Because you were scared?

630
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,199
Not scary like that.

631
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,230
Then what?

632
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,440
He might be the real deal.

633
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,039
That's what's scary.

634
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,110
Do you know who I'm most scared of?

635
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,780
People who have no use for me.

636
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,989
From this moment on,
you're banned from my OR.

637
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,719
People who jump to
conclusions about me...

638
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,889
when they don't know about me.

639
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,320
You leaving your patient...

640
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,590
already disqualifies you
as a doctor.

641
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,460
If you can't get over it,
just quit being a doctor!

642
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,699
So what?

643
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:41,900
Park Min Guk needs you?

644
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,070
He at least remembered my name.

645
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,150
Will you really not come with me?

646
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,389
I need your help.

647
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,159
Will you not help me?

648
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,699
(Patient: Ryu Woong Il,
Guardian: Lee Dae Young)

649
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,469
Will the minister's family
not be present?

650
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:16,809
His wife is deceased...

651
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,710
and his children
live on Jeju Island.

652
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,409
The weather's bad
and the planes are grounded.

653
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,710
Oh, I see.

654
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,550
I didn't see
his secretary's family either.

655
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,190
His parents died
when he was young...

656
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,019
and he has an older brother.

657
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,389
Could you not reach that brother?

658
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,500
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

659
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,510
(Doctor who explained: Master Kim)

660
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:02,880
(Patient: Lee Joo Young,
Guardian: Lee Dae Young, brother)

661
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,130
Sir. The minister's son and wife...

662
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,900
arrived at Yangyang Airport.

663
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,869
They'll come here right away.

664
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:19,199
Understood.

665
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,070
What do you mean?

666
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,909
The records got into their hands?

667
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:59,809
I just got a text
from the ICU nurse.

668
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,110
They have the charts,
surgery records,

669
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,210
even anesthesia records.

670
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,320
How... Who on earth would...

671
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,250
- Who gave them...
- I...

672
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,050
gave it all to them.

673
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,389
- What?
- What?

674
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:15,559
You did? Why?

675
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,460
I was told to.

676
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,590
By whom?

677
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:20,599
Master Kim.

678
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,599
Master Kim?

679
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,230
Yes.

680
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,639
Why did you do that?

681
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,869
Do what?

682
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,570
The minister's chart
and surgery records.

683
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,940
You told Dr. Bae
to hand it all over to them.

684
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,750
Yes. I told him to do so.

685
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,179
Why?

686
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,949
Dr. Park Min Guk.

687
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,920
I looked him up
and he's pretty good.

688
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,360
I thought that...

689
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:50,090
he'd operate on the minister
just fine, so I said...

690
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,090
Just like this,

691
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,530
you throw in the towel?

692
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,329
What?

693
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:00,239
I'm sure Do Yun Wan
has more power...

694
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:02,800
now that he's the chair
of the foundation.

695
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,510
I'm aware of that. But even so,

696
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,380
I didn't know
you'd give up so easily.

697
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,849
You saved that patient.

698
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,280
I had no idea you'd give up
on the patient so easily.

699
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,079
I didn't save him.

700
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,349
We saved him together, Ms. Oh.

701
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,889
And...

702
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,230
I haven't given up.

703
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,260
Then what do you call this?

704
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,099
Why did you let him do the surgery?

705
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,929
What's another word for crisis?

706
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,739
Anger.

707
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,010
My gosh, you really have
a horrible temper.

708
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,519
In order to turn this crisis
into an opportunity,

709
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,889
we need to surprise Do Yun Wan
with something he didn't expect.

710
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,389
But he already knows
every little thing...

711
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,590
about you and Doldam Hospital.

712
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,360
He might even know stuff
that we don't even know...

713
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:06,969
No, that's not entirely the case.

714
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,710
There are still some stuff
he doesn't know.

715
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,059
I'm here, sir.

716
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,429
Hey.

717
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,500
Did you already give him anesthesia?

718
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,039
What can I do to help?

719
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:45,210
No.

720
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,079
We don't need your help.

721
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,639
- Pardon?
- Dr. Cha.

722
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,050
I heard you get sick during surgery.

723
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:54,579
I heard it only took you
10 minutes...

724
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,889
to run out of the OR
during the minister's first surgery.

725
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,150
I'm sorry.

726
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,489
But we can't let
something like that happen...

727
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,329
in Dr. Park's OR.

728
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,059
It's out of the question.

729
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,300
But...

730
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,099
I've been following up
on the minister's condition...

731
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,599
ever since he came to the hospital.

732
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:13,639
So I'm sure I'll be of help.

733
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:17,010
It's okay.
We're already expecting someone.

734
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:19,369
There he is.

735
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:24,550
Woo Jin? What's going on?

736
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,409
What do you think?

737
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:29,820
He betrayed you and joined the team
so he could grab the opportunity.

738
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,989
Woo Jin is a pro when it comes
to stabbing people in the back.

739
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:39,230
The minister is under anesthesia.

740
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,829
Okay, let's all get ready.

741
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:43,900
Yes, sir.

742
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,949
Why me?

743
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,920
I know there's not much to do
other than to perform a suture.

744
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,889
But they still need someone
who knows about the first surgery.

745
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,889
You're the only one
who knows enough to join,

746
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,360
so I want you to help.

747
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,960
No.

748
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,429
I wasn't asking for an opinion.
Just do as I say.

749
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,639
If you don't go,
Eun Jae will have to go instead.

750
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,440
Do you really want to see her vomit
and run out of the OR again?

751
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,610
Do you think it'll be okay?

752
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,409
How would I know?

753
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,289
Master Kim
always thinks differently.

754
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,690
But don't you think
we'd at least be able to tell...

755
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,820
which doctor will stay
and which doctor will leave?

756
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,059
What if they both leave?

757
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,030
They both might stay.

00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:38,309

759
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:39,409

760
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,079
That jerk.

761
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,849
Okay, let's begin.

762
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,559
Let's begin the surgery.

763
00:55:58,829 --> 00:55:59,829
Scalpel.

764
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,469
Scalpel.

765
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,909
"Friendly"?

766
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,449
Since when were we friends?

767
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,380
Since when did you
think so much of me...

768
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,590
to give me such advice?

769
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,090
To be honest,

770
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:27,420
back then...

771
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:48,139
My gosh, I'm in so much trouble!
I'm so late.

772
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,260
What am I going to do?

773
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:07,599
Why did I have to be late
to Professor Jung's lecture?

774
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:11,130
My gosh, this is crazy.

bone marrow disease...

776

What is this?

777
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:22,210
This is our first class,
and you're already late?

778
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm sorry, sir.

779
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
You know I'm not lenient...

780
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,420
when it comes to tardiness
and absence, right?

781
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,989
- Name.
- Seo Woo Jin, sir.

782

Let's see. "Seo Woo Jin".

783
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,989
That's minus three points for you.

784
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,400
Don't be late from now on.
Do you understand?

785
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:42,730
Yes, sir.

786
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,980
Isn't Eun Jae amazing?

787
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,579
She got all A's again this semester.

788
00:57:57,579 --> 00:57:59,349
I heard she doesn't
even have dinner...

789
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,219
because she thinks
it's a waste of time.

790
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:02,579
Some say she doesn't even
go to the bathroom.

791
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,719
- My gosh, stop it.
- She's been like that...

792
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,690
ever since high school.

793
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,460
She's obsessed
with getting the best grades.

794
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,489
- How annoying. Why doesn't she eat?
- Who knows?

795
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:12,260
I hope I don't get put on probation.
Otherwise, I'm as good as dead.

when it comes to practical exams.

804

Meanwhile, you barely make the cut
when it comes to written exams.

805
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:58,670
Let me know
if you need anything.

806
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,400
How about we help each other out?

807
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,570
Can you give me some help
with the practical exams?

The pros of dropping out
of med school.

818
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,730
I can sleep, have fun,
and do whatever I want.

819
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,030
I'll no longer have to take exams.

820
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:05,570
I don't need to study anatomy.

821
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,170
I can get a puppy.
I can surf, travel,

822
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,670
and play StarCraft all day.

823
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,469
I can meet up with friends and chat.

824
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,539
I can date.

827
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:21,420
My mom will be sad.

828
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:29,690
When I found out that you were
actually enduring it...

829
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,429
instead of doing well,

830
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:35,400
that's when I changed.

(Reason for dropping out:
Cannot afford to pay tuition)

834
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,300
No, you're not
supposed to stick it down like that.

835
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,829
You have to keep it down
and do it in one go.

836
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,099
In one go?

837
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,769
Just do it in one go.

838
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,670
My gosh, I don't think I can do it.

839
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,739
It hurts even more if you hesitate.

840
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:22,039
Okay.

841
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,150
- Just be brave and stick it in.
- Okay.

842
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,849
- I'll be brave and stick it in.
- Yes.

843
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:28,920
Be brave and stick it in.

844
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:36,889
My gosh.

(Dr. Romantic 2)

846
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,449
I'm going to sue the doctors
and the hospital...

847
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:01,119
for medical malpractice.

848
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,849
Is that even worthy of a lawsuit?

849
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,489
Did they try to coax somehow?

850
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,460
I know you want to go back
to Geosan.

851
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,030
I'll convince Dr. Park
to take you back.

852
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,559
So promise me
that you'll keep quiet.

853
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,530
If you decided to stand
on Master Kim's side,

854
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,960
you'd better stay there.

855
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,070
You annoying opportunist.

856
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,800
What about the CT scan?
Didn't you check before you came in?

857
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,699
You put me in the OR...

858
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,440
because you wanted to see...

859
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,769
how I'd react to Dr. Park?
You tested me?

860
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,139
I thought you wanted me
to find an answer!

861
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:31,780
Darn you.
