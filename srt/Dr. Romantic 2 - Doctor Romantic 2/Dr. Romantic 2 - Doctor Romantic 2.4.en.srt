(Alprazolam)

3
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,359
really scrub in?

4
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,460
Yes. I will.

5
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,090
Who's scrubbing in?

6
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,390
Dr. Seo Woo Jin.

7
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,799
He's the doctor
who assisted the first surgery,

8
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,270
so I was asked to let you know
he'd be of help.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,969
By Dr. Boo?

10
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,500
No, Master Kim.

11
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:11,109
That's the name
he goes by at Doldam.

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,709
Now, get ready to scrub in.

13
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,019
How much should I tell them?

14
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,150
- What?
- The...

15
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,560
The fact that you conducted the
surgery without a CT scan first...

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,530
and the way you caught
the intercostal vessel bleeding...

17
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,430
will both give them an excuse
to find fault with you.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,159
- And?
- It'll put you in a bad position.

19
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,170
Why is that any of your concern?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,069
I don't want to be troubled later.

21
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,239
I wanted to make sure
that I wouldn't...

22
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:45,840
be held responsible.

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,049
You're one consistent
little weasel, aren't you?

24
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,019
I was the operating surgeon,
so the responsibility is all on me.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,219
Just focus on the surgery at hand...

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,359
and answer
Dr. Park's questions truthfully.

27
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,230
As in the facts?

28
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
Yes, just stick to the facts...

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,229
and what you saw.

30
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,000

in the operation room.

I'm good.

33
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,669
I can do this.

34
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,610
It's okay.

35
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,879
We're already expecting someone.

36
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,449
There he is.

37
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,949
Woo Jin?

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,419
What's going on?

39
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,889
What do you think?

40
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,120
He betrayed you
and joined the team...

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,620
so he could grab the opportunity.

42
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,629
Woo Jin is a pro when it comes
to stabbing people in the back.

43
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,009
Let's begin the surgery.

00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,259
Excuse me.

57
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,930
Can you believe it?

58
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,209
President Yeo,
how can I be of service?

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh, you saw the news?

60
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,949
I didn't contact you
since you were on vacation.

61
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,279
I see.

62
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:17,089
I am here by the operating rooms.

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,889
In Operating Room One,
the doctors from Geodae...

64
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,990
are conducting
the minister's second surgery.

65
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,500
Meanwhile, in Operating Room Two,

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,730
Master Kim is working
on the minister's driver.

67
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,870
You will not believe the amount
of tension from both rooms.

68
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,470
How should I put it?

69
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,269
It's as if two skilled swordsmen...

70
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,740
are going head-to-head.

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,709
We'll check for bleeding
in the abdomen first...

72
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,980
and remove the gauze
that was inserted.

73
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,990
Can I get some more?
The larger ones, please.

74
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,720
Keep the gauze coming.

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
There's more bleeding
than I expected.

76
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,829
Retractor.

77
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,470
Right angle forceps.

78
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,170
They did a neat job.

79
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,110
How much did he bleed
during the first surgery?

80
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,120
30 units of packed RBC
and 20 units of FFP.

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
That's a lot.

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,790
The patient was taking aspirin.

83
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,149
It wasn't easy to stop the bleeding.

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,290
A skilled surgeon sure is different.

85
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,019
Even so, he still managed to.

86
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,529
Dr. Park, there's really
not much for you to do.

87
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,160
According to the surgery record,

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,870
there was bleeding
of the intercostal vessel.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
Even though we fixed
the hemoperitoneum,

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,899
he bled 800cc from his chest.

91
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,269
After changing his position,

92
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,069
we spotted
the intercostal vessel bleeding.

93
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,009
What about the CT scan?

94
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,250
Was it not checked
prior to the surgery?

95
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,490
The doctor asked you a question.

96
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,990
Did you not check the CT scan?

97
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,899
Forget the CT scan
and send him to the OR.

98
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,269
You'll operate without
taking a CT scan first?

99
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,500
Every second is vital here.

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,310
Dragging it out
by sticking to ever protocol...

101
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,610
will only end up killing him.

102
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,480
His condition was critical
and BP was low.

103
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,610
Did you...

104
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,009
not even take one?

105
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,459
No.

106
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,230
Are you insane?

107
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,089
You opened up the minister
without taking a CT scan first?

108
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,800
Like I said, the patient's condition
was worsening by the second.

109
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
In cases like this,

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,529
I was told that damage control
should take priority.

111
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,569
So tell me.

112
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,670
How did he know...

113
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,170
about the intercostal vessel
bleeding without a CT scan?

114
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,180
It was all thanks
to your gut feeling and luck.

115
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,250
If that's all you saw,

116
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,680
it means you aren't
any better either.

117
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,019
What is it?

118
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,790
Can't you answer me?

119
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,759
No.

120
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,230
- That's not it.
- Then what?

121
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,829
Did he pay you?

122
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,670
How much did he offer you
to keep your mouth shut?

123
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,610
Thank you for the update,
Manager Jang.

124
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,310
Let me know once they're done.

125
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,050
Sure.

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,779
- Goodness.
- Gosh, I'm sorry, sir.

127
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,289
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,820
Are you new here?

129
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,460
How did you know?

130
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,960
Are you a regular patient here?

131
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,259
With which department?

132
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,129
You see, I'm the president...

133
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,570
You're one
of the president's patients?

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,870
I'm sorry to tell you this,

135
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,600
but he's on leave at the moment.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
No, I mean that...

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,940
- Just a second, sir.
- What?

138
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,480
The lobby is currently
bustling with people,

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,080
so let's head to the ER.

140
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,549
That's my department, you see.

141
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,820
You're in luck because...

142
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,090
things are slow there.

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,460
I'll check you out myself.
This way, sir.

144
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,559
Sure.

145
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,830
Excuse me, coming through.

146
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,529
- Sorry, excuse me.
- A change in plan?

147
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:19,299
- Excuse me.
- What's going on?

148
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,009
Dr. Cha?

149
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,720
Dr. Cha? Dr. Cha?

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,450
Are you sick?

151
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,220
I wasn't sleeping.

152
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,590
What?

153
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,259
I wasn't asleep.

154
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,299
I'm just fine.

Oh. Okay, got it.

157

I'll be right there. Bye.

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,149
Wait. Where are you going?

159
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,990
A rib fracture patient came in.

160
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,720
A rib fracture?

161
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,019
Then I should go.

162
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,259
I'll go. I will go.

163
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,710
Ms. Uhm, one of the president's
regular patients came in,

164
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,509
and I said I'd take a look.

165
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,309
Please take his temperature and BP.

166
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,409
Bed two.

167
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,710
The president's regular patient?

168
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,720
Who is it?

169
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,019
Oh, dear...

170
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,659
He bumped into a tractor
and has a pain in his right chest.

171
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,490
Dr. Cha.

172
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,629
Oh, yes.

173
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,029
But why did you call the OS doctor?

174
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,269
Rib fractures are CS territory.

175
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,370
What? Well, I checked the FAST,

176
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,340
and there was no bleeding,
the saturation was good,

177
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,210
and I didn't see any damaged organs.

178
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,350
Until now, I took all the simple
rib fractures cases, Dr. Cha.

179
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh, come on.

180
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,950
You don't have to speak
so politely to me, Dr. Bae.

181
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,259
Speak casually, more comfortably.

182
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,559
Okay, I'll do that in time.

183
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,360
I need a while to befriend people.

184
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,590
You can't be like that to me.

185
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,230
You know, I even joined
the Bone Club because of you.

186
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,100
Don't you remember
these exquisite phalanges?

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,269
(Phalanges: Finger bones)

188
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,769
"Your mid and distal phalanx
are especially beautiful."

189
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,409
"Perfect hands for a surgeon."

190
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,580
You even said that to me.

191
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,950
Don't you remember?

192
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:52,379
So, what should we do
about this patient, Dr. Cha?

193
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,320
Get a CT scan first.

194
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,620
If there's internal bleeding,

195
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,120
he could require surgery.

196
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,529
What? Will I need surgery?

197
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,929
No. She didn't say
she'll operate, sir.

198
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,460
You may look fine,

199
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,899
but you could suddenly
start to bleed.

200
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:09,929
Bleeding?

201
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,370
Is my condition that serious?

202
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,980
No, sir. Just in case,
we must take a CT.

203
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,340
Get going.

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,149
- Okay. Let's...
- Dr. Jung!

205
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,809
Why do you keep interrupting me?

206
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,750
We have a duty
and responsibility to explain...

207
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,419
all possible outcomes
to the patient.

208
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,259
That way, we can defend ourselves
even if we're sued.

209
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,529
Patients come after us all the time.

210
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,590
Dr. Bae!

211
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,600
Dr. Cha, we need to talk.

212
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,500
Am I wrong, Dr. Bae?

213
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,470
You're right.
Now turn around this way.

214
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,029
Come along.

215
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,799
Call when the CT result is out.

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,940
Let's get a coffee, Dr. Cha.

217
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,710
Oh, dear. In my dream last night,

218
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,279
I saw my late mother,
and now this...

219
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,549
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear...

220
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,179
- We need a CT!
- Mother...

221
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,519
Who am I talking to?

222
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,149
Dr. Yun! Ms. Uhm!

223
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,490
What's the matter?

224
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,399
Do you know him too?

225
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,059
Yes, of course. I know him too well.

226
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,100
You really are
a regular here, Grandpa.

227
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,500
Even Ms. Uhm knows you.

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
I have been coming here
for a long time.

229
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,149
I'll take a listen then.

230
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,149
It'll be slightly cold.
Breathe in deeply.

231
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,649
Breathe out.

232
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,419
Again, breathe in deeply.

233
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,830
Breathe out.

234
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,899
Look. What's this?

235
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,110
Master Kim. It's a text
from Manager Jang.

236
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,879
A green gauze came out
of the minister's stomach.

237
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,750
His bile must be leaking.

238
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,919
Right angle forceps.

239
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,289
There. We got the splenic artery.

240
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,659
Metz.

241
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,730
Tie.

242
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,039
Clip.

243
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,610
It's bile peritonitis.

244
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,710
I think the bile duct is damaged.

245
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,750
- Irrigation.
- Suction.

246
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,320
There's no leakage.

247
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,860
It's tied well.

248
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,320
Undo the cystic duct.

249
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,860
A trans-cystic biliary drain...

250
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,129
- will help us find the leak.
- Okay.

251
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,929
Scalpel.

252
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,100
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

253
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,870
- I must've touched the clip.
- Gauze.

254
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:03,940
Keep pressure.

255
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,779
- Keep going.
- Gauze.

256
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,580
BP's falling.

257
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,450
There must be another bleed.

258
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,990
Get more blood.

259
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,600
Is something going wrong?

260
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,769
I'm not sure.

261
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,070
I'm concerned as well.

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,909
That man is not Master Kim.

263
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,509
Bovie. Take a hold of this, Ms. Kim.

264
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,629
Forceps.

265
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I found it.

266
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,039
The clip caused a bleed
in the hepatic artery.

267
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,039
Forceps.

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,539
Clip.

269
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:15,750
Gauze stick.

270
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,320
Hold this.

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,299
Okay.

272
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,629
90 over 50.

273
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,340
Dr. Yang, keep your wits about you.

274
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,000
I apologize.

275
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,440
His bowels are very swollen.

276
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,539
I don't think you can suture
in this condition.

277
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,179
What will you do?

278
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,940
Lee Joo Young is your brother?

279
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,279
Yes.

280
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,650
The surgery went very well.

281
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,049
A couple of days in the ICU
for observation, and he'll be fine.

282
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,359
- Thank you.
- Sure.

283
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,640
Just so you know, they couldn't
complete the minister's surgery.

284
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,910
I'm not entirely sure,

285
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,150
but a mistake from their staff
caused a bleed.

286
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,420
Dr. Yun.

287
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,460
Ms. Uhm.

288
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,890
I need a CT...

289
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,599
- Mr. President.
- What?

290
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,869
What are you doing here?

291
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,400
You're off until this week.

292
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,200
You're the president?

293
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,740
I saw the news
and cut my holiday short.

294
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,910
How am I, Ms. Uhm?

295
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,349
Your temperature is normal.

296
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:31,849
Your BP is slightly high,
but within the normal range, sir.

297
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,990
You're Dr. Yun, right?

298
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,789
You check your patients
very carefully.

299
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,700
I brought you some bread.

300
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,559
Share with everyone.

301
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll go upstairs then.

302
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,940
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

303
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,680
Who needs the CT?

304
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,509
- Bed six.
- Okay.

305
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,910
What should I do?

306
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,079
Don't worry. Our president
doesn't mind things like that.

307
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,289
I guess he wanted to see
how good you were.

308
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,109
(Yeo Woon Young)

309
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,880
Have you guys been well?

310
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,289
So?

311
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,329
They ended the second surgery
without being able to suture.

312
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,329
The Minister was transferred back
to the ICU.

313
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,900
Maybe there was a problem
during the first surgery.

314
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,839
Professor Park Min Guk is...

315
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,109
the most competent doctor
in Geodae Medical Center...

316
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,410
while Dr. Boo Yong Joo is
the over-the-hill doctor...

317
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,640
who lives with another name...

318
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,410
after getting kicked out
to a branch.

319
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,210
Anyone would think
this problem was caused...

320
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,950
by Master Kim who conducted
the first surgery.

321
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,619
It's quite complicated to check
if that's true, Reporter Park.

322
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,089
It's fine.

323
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,529
Raising suspicion is enough.

324
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,359
That's what the media should do,
you know.

325
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,130
Raising doubts nonstop.

326
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,130
Don't you agree?

327
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,700
Let's do it this way first then.

328
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,109
This is bad.

329
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,690
They're the minister's son
and his wife.

330
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,329
Hello.

331
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm Park Min Guk, the chief doctor
who performed the second surgery.

332
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,930
Our flight was delayed due
to the weather condition in Jeju.

333
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,839
How is my father?

334
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,670
During the second surgery,

335
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,970
we found a few problems,

336
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,680
but we dealt with them quickly.

337
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,009
His condition is not so grave
at the moment.

338
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,750
I heard everything would be okay
after the second surgery.

339
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:18,950
Is he not still okay? Why?

340
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,289
The organs are still swollen
unlike how we expected.

341
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,950
We will arrange the date...

342
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,619
for the third surgery
once the swelling subsides.

343
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,200
Where's the doctor whom I talked to
during the first surgery?

344
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,900
This way.

345
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,140
I'm sorry. If only I hadn't made
that mistake...

346
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Shut it.

347
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,509
Shut your mouth and stay still.

348
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,390
Darn, it's driving me crazy.

349
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,890
(No Visitors Allowed)

350
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,480
So did they find the leakage point?

351
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,180
Yes, we found it on the gallbladder.

352
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,079
It's fine then.

353
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,150
They stopped the leakage
from the gallbladder and the vessel.

354
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,589
Any other problems?

355
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:32,960
Well, that's...

356
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,000
- Sir.
- Yes?

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The Minister's son and his wife
are here.

358
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,369
They'd like to have a talk with you.

359
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,279
- Give me a moment.
- Sure.

360
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,490
Everything else is all right.

361
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,289
Thanks for your hard work.

362
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,930
He's the doctor you spoke to
on the phone.

363
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,329
Hello.

364
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,440
Shall we go to my office?

365
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,839
- Sure.
- Let's go.

366
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,180
What's with you, punk?

367
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,980
You're nothing but a bedbug
that mooches off here and there.

368
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,289
How dare you play smart with me?

369
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,890
If you chose to work with
Master Kim or whatever his name is,

370
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,490
keep doing it.

371
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,859
Don't covet someone else's place
in the OR, you punk.

372
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,259
You think Dr. Park
will pay attention to you...

373
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,529
if you act up like that?

374
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,069
I didn't do that
to gain his attention.

375
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,970
Then did you do that on purpose
to sock it to me?

376
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,710
It was you who touched the clip,
not me.

377
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,880
- What?
- And it wasn't me...

378
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,079
who couldn't deal
with the leakage immediately.

379
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,710
Why you little...

380
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,750
If you want a conversation, talk.

381
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,059
Next time, you might have
your wrists broken, sir.

382
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,589
You're unbelievable.

383
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,660
Now you don't give a thing
about seniority?

384
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,329
Seniority or whatever that is,

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,369
I give a thing
about too many things,

386
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,210
and that's the problem.

387
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,490
Darn it!

388
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,670
Dr. Cha?

389
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,470
Dr. Cha.

390
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,339
What about the CT scan?

391
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,869
The patient is under the process
in the CT room right now.

392
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,109
It might take 10 to 20 more minutes
to be done.

393
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,650
I see.

394
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,769
Dr. Seo.

395
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,329
What's wrong with Dr. Cha?

396
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:34,799
Hey, Dr. Cha.

397
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,869
I don't know. I guess
she couldn't sleep last night.

398
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,539
She's dozing off all day.

399
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,650
Hey, Cha Eun Jae.

400
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,420
The betrayer is here.

401
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,589
What are you looking at?

402
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,230
I'm talking about you, Seo Woo Jin!

403
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,569
Look at you.

404
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,539
Stand straight.

405
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Gosh, stop moving.

406
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,680
I got you, you betrayer.

407
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,049
You're a jerk.

408
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,349
I'm going to kill you.

409
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,720
You are...

410
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,960
dead meat.

411
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Dead meat...

412
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
Well...

413
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,509
Dr. Cha?

414
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,130
Gosh.

415
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,529
Did she fall asleep
in that posture just now?

416
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,200
Right, Ms. Uhm?

417
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,670
I think so.

418
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,809
Wash your face and wake up.

419
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,680
It's a hassle.

420
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,279
You're a mess right now.
Wash your face and wake up.

421
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,950
I won't!

422
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,480
I can't be bothered.

423
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't care, so go away.

424
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,319
Stop acting like a baby.

425
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,420
You're crazy.

426
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,359
Does it look like
I'm acting like a baby to you?

427
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,700
You're pestering
and throwing a fit...

428
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,059
because things didn't go
as you wanted.

429
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,430
You took away my surgery.

430
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,900
It was my opportunity
to go back to Geosan.

431
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,809
You stabbed me in the back...

432
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,240
and took my opportunity,
you betrayer.

433
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,880
It's not that I wanted.

434
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,309
Don't be ridiculous.

435
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,750
Don't you think I know how you are?

436
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,819
You don't care
about friends or anything...

437
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,990
as long as you can get paid.

438
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,190
You're an annoying opportunist.

439
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,990
Why did you call me
to the OR that day?

440
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,569
You could've just dealt with
that diaphragm tear by yourself.

441
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,400
I wouldn't have been kicked out
to this place.

442
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,210
This is all because of you.

443
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,680
Does it make you feel better...

444
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,380
if you blame others?

445
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,619
What?

446
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:37,890
All right then.

447
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,859
Keep living like that.

448
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,329
(Alprazolam)

449
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,250
I heard there was an issue
with the first surgery.

450
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,880
An issue?

451
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,019
I don't understand
what you're saying.

452
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,289
A reporter called me on my way here.

453
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,289
He said that you were responsible...

454
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,430
for the second surgery
not being a success.

455
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,329
Sorry? What are you talking about?

456
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,529
He said you didn't bother
to take a CT scan first.

457
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,430
Is that true?

458
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,170
In the field,

459
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,869
it's quite common
with severe trauma patients.

460
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,950
You seem comfortable
openly admitting your negligence.

461
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,849
Well, calling
his actions negligent is...

462
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,420
He operated without
taking the basic steps.

463
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,119
How is that not negligence?

464
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,720
The situation called
for a drastic measure.

465
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,660
I wasn't talking to the manager.

466
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,259
My questions are directed
at the operating surgeon.

467
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,230
It's all right.

468
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,430
What is it that you want to say?

469
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,829
If you weren't confident
in your abilities,

470
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,839
you shouldn't have operated.

471
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,869
How dare you
still open up my father?

472
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,740
He wasn't in a condition
to be transferred.

473
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,309
He still isn't.

474
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,480
Just to be able to tell the world
you operated on a Minister,

475
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,410
you ignored basic protocols...

476
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,319
and acted irrationally.

477
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,789
Can I take your silence
as an admission of guilt?

478
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,690
If I valued my reputation...

479
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,529
over the life of a patient,

480
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,799
I would've declared his death
instead of operating.

481
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,569
Considering your father's condition
when he was brought it,

482
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,440
that would've been the easier route.

483
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,309
Then there's nothing more to say.

484
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,519
I will sue you and this hospital
on charges of malpractice.

485
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,150
What? You'll sue us?

486
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,640
What? He's suing us?

487
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
That's right.

488
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,039
He'll sue Master Kim
and the hospital.

489
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,079
You've got to be kidding me.

490
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,750
How can you sue a doctor
for not taking a CT scan first?

491
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,880
It doesn't even count
as malpractice.

492
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,220
The charges won't stick.

493
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,180
The patient isn't
in critical condition anymore.

494
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,490
Without definitive evidence,

495
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,490
malpractice charges
are difficult to prove.

496
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,500
There is a recording
of the second surgery.

497
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,569
I think there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

498
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,170
I've been with the minister
since he was brought in...

499
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,710
and there's nothing
to suggest malpractice.

500
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,480
The reporter told me
that there is a recording.

501
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,279
It will prove how ludicrous
the first surgery was.

502
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,980
That's what he told me.

503
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,529
That's odd.

504
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,759
Dr. Seo didn't say anything
about a recording.

505
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,430
Dr. Seo could be deliberately
keeping it from us.

506
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,670
Why?

507
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,569
Why would he? What's there to hide?

508
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,869
What if Dr. Seo...

509
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:52,910
said something
that'll prove their case?

510
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,809
What's there to say?

511
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,250
The first surgery
was a complete success.

512
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,920
Potato, po-tah-do, right?

513
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,349
You very well know...

514
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:03,519
how the delivery of one's words
can cause misunderstandings.

515
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,990
But why?

516
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,960
Why would Dr. Seo
help their case though?

517
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,289
What if...

518
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,759
Do you three...

519
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,289
have something to say to me?

520
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,799
That jerk.

521
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,440
The recording of the surgery...

522
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,880
Did you download it?

523
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,250
Yes, right after the surgery ended.

524
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,680
But...

525
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,599
Yes, this is Cha Eun Jae.

526
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,969
What was that again?

527
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,769
Yes, of course. I'll be right there.

528
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,949
Can we talk, Dr. Cha?

529
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,219
What did you tell Dr. Park
in the OR?

530
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,230
Dr. Park asked about
the first surgery...

531
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,800
and I answered.

532
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,329
Including answers that
could hurt this hospital?

533
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,039
Why do you ask?

534
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:02,739
You see, the minister's son...

535
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:06,179
is suing Master Kim for malpractice.

536
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,679
The recording of
the second surgery...

537
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,909
will probably be their
key piece of evidence.

538
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:18,590
Why didn't you tell us
that the surgery was recorded?

539
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,960
You didn't ask.

540
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,599
Dr. Seo, this isn't the time to act
like you're not a part of this.

541
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:27,900
Master Kim's...

542
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,769
and this hospital's reputation
are on the line.

543
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,900
Did you...

544
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,369
Was there...

545
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,840
Did the other team
offer you some kind of a deal?

546
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,380
Manager Jang!

547
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,820
What do you mean by that?

548
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,349
In exchange for your testimony
against Master Kim,

549
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,690
did they offer you anything...

550
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,090
As in money?

551
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,090
Please don't take this wrong way.

552
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,329
Manager Jang is only asking if...

553
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,460
Did you accept it?

554
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,570
Manager Jang, stop it!

555
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,699
- You're making me sick.
- But Ms. Oh...

556
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,440
Here or there...

557
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,150
You're all the same.

558
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,289
Dr. Seo...

559
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,690
Seriously?

560
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,360
- Dr. Seo!
- But...

561
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,570
What?

562
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,199
It was a reasonable question.

563
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,670
As soon as Dr. Seo
came to our hospital,

564
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,539
the first thing he asked
from Master Kim was money.

565
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,809
That he needed some.

566
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,780
This is just wrong, Manager Jang.

567
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,679
Can't I even ask?

568
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:52,719
My goodness.

569
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,590
Dr. Seo. Dr. Seo Woo Jin.

570
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,769
If you were that curious,
why didn't you ask yourself?

571
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,699
If I accepted their bribe.

572
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,369
What are you saying?

573
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,739
What I saw, the facts, the truth!

574
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,739
You told me to answer.

575
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,449
Was that all a test?

576
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,619
Did you send me in
on purpose to test me...

577
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,159
and to see how I'd act
around Dr. Park?

578
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,030
- Dr. Seo!
- You said, find the answer!

579
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,369
Darn you.

580
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,079
Ms. Oh. What was all that about?

581
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,889
Will you keep
your mouth shut, Dr. Cha?

582
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,989
I know you want to return to Geodae.

583
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:43,760
I'll put in a good word to Dr. Park.

584
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,829
Promise you'll keep quiet. Okay?

585
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,699
You know, a while ago...

586
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,179
Hey. I don't care either.

587
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:17,389
Send the money.
If not, you really die this time.

588
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:29,570
What is it?

589
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,309
Dr. Cha's here.

590
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,380
Didn't I tell you to call Dr. Bae?

591
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,179
Well, I did call him.

592
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,849
Call CS.

593
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,889
CS takes rib fractures from now on.

594
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,559
Oh, did he say that? I see.

595
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,159
- Who's the patient?
- Well...

596
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,630
It's the rib fracture patient
from earlier.

597
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,730
He keeps complaining of chest pains.

598
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,800
What about the CT scan?

599
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,110
His lungs look okay
and I see no bleeding.

600
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,710
I did an EKG and
checked his cardiac enzymes,

601
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,739
and all are fine.

602
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,449
Ms. Uhm, did you check
what medication he's taking?

603
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,280
Nothing but pills for his BP.

604
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,550
A segmental fracture?

605
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,050
(Segmental fracture:
Multiple fracture lines)

606
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,289
Dr. Jung! The patient's
saturation is falling.

607
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,190
Call Master Kim now. Quick.

608
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,960
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

609
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,840
Sir, does your chest still hurt?

610
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,940
Saturation's 78 and falling.

611
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,909
This won't do. Let's intubate.

612
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,480
Just a moment.

613
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,280
What is it?

614
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,989
Flail chest?

615
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,719
Flail chest?

616
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,719
Do you have face masks
or venturi masks?

617
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,829
We don't.

618
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,289
Then let's intubate, Dr. Jung.

619
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,389
- Ms. Joo.
- Okay.

620
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,000
Inject an ampule of tramadol
into his IV.

621
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,800
I need a 10cc syringe and lidocaine.

622
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Okay.

623
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,170
I'll control the pain
with an intercostal nerve block.

624
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,440
Tube.

625
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,449
Here it is, Dr. Cha.

626
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:27,119
- Pull out.
- Okay.

627
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,610
Is the ventilator set?

628
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,880
Yes.

629
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,849
What are you doing?
That much pressure?

630
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,119
It's positive pressure.

631
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,050
The fractured ribs
are moving against it,

632
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,190
so he needs more pressure
when he breathes in.

633
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,260
Does he?

634
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:14,000
Saturation is rising
to the normal range.

635
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,639
Really?

636
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,570
What a relief.

637
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,139
How did you recognize
it was the flail chest?

638
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,980
I saw it once
at Geodae Medical Center.

639
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,480
In a victim of a traffic accident.

640
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,849
You treated it pretty quickly
considering you saw it just once.

641
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,719
I'm a fast learner.

642
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,460
I didn't mean to brag.

643
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:13,559
Why were you in the ER then?
Are you in the ER often?

644
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,860
How did you know?

645
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm usually in the ER
when I'm on night duty.

646
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,840
Cardiac arrest victims
usually come in at night.

647
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,469
To them, time is golden.

648
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,039
I'm really good at CPR.

649
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,980
I also have an ACLS license.

650
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,980
Did you ever rush out of the ER?

651
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,250
No.

652
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,190
Then looking at blood or
making simple cuts with a knife...

653
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,489
Yes. I can do all that in the ER.

654
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,829
I'm okay with it all
as long as it's not in the OR.

655
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,969
Okay. You can go.

656
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,800
Okay, then. Bye.

657
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,809
That patient might
need the ventilator...

658
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,610
for a week or even longer.

659
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,920
- Pardon?
- Follow up carefully.

660
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:09,789
He's your first patient.

661
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,230
Didn't you tell me
to quit being a doctor?

662
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,260
Hey.

663
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,500
If I told you to quit,
would you really quit?

664
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,440
No.

665
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:28,869
My gosh.

666
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,809
Get going.

667
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:34,809
Okay.

668
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,110
I'll call you when the patient
is transferred to the ward.

669
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,320
Okay. Thanks.

670
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,829
Why didn't you commend her?
She did really well.

671
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:03,539
Why bother when
she knows that better than anyone?

672
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,989
What was that? He said
he didn't need a doctor like me.

673
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,269
Shouldn't we
come up with a plan too?

674
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,340
He's saying...

675
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,369
he'll sue us
for medical malpractice.

676
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:40,079
We can't just sit back
and let that happen.

677
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,579
If it happens to be true that...

678
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:46,449
Dr. Seo is playing both sides,

679
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:47,820
what would happen then?

680
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:52,019
It was Master Kim
who sent Dr. Seo into that OR.

681
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,219
That means...

682
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,889
Master Kim trusts him
to some extend, doesn't it?

683
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,760
You do it if you want. I'm out.

684
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,260
The betrayer is here.

685
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,170
It's not that I wanted.

686
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,340
You're an annoying opportunist.

687
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,550
Dr. Cha?

688
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,760
You left it in the staff lounge.

689
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,469
I'm sorry about earlier.

690
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,639
We shouldn't have asked such things
without any evidence.

691
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,179
It's our fault.

692
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,440
As an adult,

693
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,349
I'd like to apologize.

694
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:56,449
There's no need.

695
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,650
Manager Jang could be right.

696
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,820
I do anything as long as
I can make money.

697
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,590
If you were really like that,
you would chase after money...

698
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,500
instead of looking for an answer.

699
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,800
Didn't you say that earlier?

700
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,309
That you need to find an answer.

701
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,849
- Ms. Uhm.
- Yes?

702
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,820
Is something up to Dr. Yun?

703
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,489
Well, it's because of President Yeo.

704
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,760
President Yeo?

705
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,960
She thought
he was a regular patient.

706
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,760
She escorted him here
and even examined him.

707
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,030
She treated the president?

708
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,039
Yes, she checked
his body temperature and pulse.

709
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:50,809
She even auscultated him.
She did everything she could.

710
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,559
What are you going to do?

711
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,489
What? Well...

712
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,329
I have something
to tell the president.

713
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:14,860
What is it about?

714
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:18,699
Actually,
when I examined him earlier,

715
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,900
I heard some strange sounds
in his lungs.

716
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,139
If that's what it is about,
you can talk to me first.

717
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,869
What?

718
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:30,050
You didn't have to return this soon.

719
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,610
You should've rested a little more.

720
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:40,260
I saw the news,
and things seemed crazy.

721
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,030
I couldn't rest alone.

722
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,960
I heard Minister Ryu's son said
he'd sue you and this hospital.

723
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,170
Well, doctors like us are always...

724
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,800
in between inspection
and accusation.

725
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,239
There wasn't much trouble
in the operation.

726
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,210
I'll have to get through it somehow.

727
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,849
I heard Do Yun Wan came back.

728
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,920
It might not be so easy this time.

729
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:18,130
People without self-respect tend
to have a strong pride.

730
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,429
He got a scratch on his pride.

731
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:24,269
I bet he's determined this time.

732
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,039
What about the pain?

733
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:31,269
How is it?

734
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,210
Should we play a game of go?
It's been long since we did it.

735
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,719
Gosh, sir.

736
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,190
- I should act like I don't know?
- Yes.

737
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,190
Just act like you don't know.

738
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,559
To President Yeo
as well as the staff.

739
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,190
I can't do that.

740
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,530
I clearly heard the sound
in his lungs, so how can I?

741
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,070
By any chance,
does he know about this?

742
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,969
Yes, he knows.

743
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,440
What about the staff?

744
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,309
Just me and Master Kim.

745
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,980
What about Ms. Oh?

746
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,280
She doesn't know yet.

747
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,449
- So...
- I get it.

748
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,420
You want me to keep my mouth shut.

749
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,460
I'd appreciate it if you could.

750
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,289
Okay, I will.

751
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,199
I should.

752
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,130
Please do it then.

753
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,199
Let me check your eyes.

754
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,469
(Emergency Room)

755
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,440
You'll file a lawsuit?

756
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,739
Yes.

757
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,280
So I need the video recording
of the second surgery.

758
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,079
Video recording?

759
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,050
I don't understand.

760
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:57,449
I heard that you have a recording
of the second surgery...

761
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,860
the recording includes
the statement of the doctor...

762
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,820
who conducted the first surgery.

763
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,559
Who gave you that information?

764
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,199
An anonymous reporter.

765
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,099
He said he's someone
who respects you, Dr. Park.

766
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,309
The recording of the surgery...

767
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:20,710
Did you download it?

768
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,340
But...

769
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:26,150
wouldn't it be more disadvantageous
for us if this gets out?

770
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,480
That's why...

771
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,150
we must be careful
not to let this out.

772
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,449
Did you delete it from your phone?

773
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,760
Yes, I did.

774
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,389
Do you have a black USB stick?

775
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,829
You mean, this?

776
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:45,130
No, something smaller.

777
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,199
- Well...
- I checked the file.

778
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,139
Yes, I'll send it there. Bye.

779
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,980
Can I borrow this for five minutes?

780
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:04,650
(Geodae Medical Center)

781
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,019
I think you got
the wrong information.

782
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,829
There's no recording of the surgery.

783
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,000
Are you trying to cover for him
because he's a doctor like you?

784
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,230
Of course not.

785
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:21,170
I put everything aside
and came all the way here...

786
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,800
to save Minister Ryu.

787
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,269
Trust me.

788
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,639
There's no recording.

789
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:28,840
Dr. Heo.

790
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,510
This.

791
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,449
Isn't this yours?

792
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,219
It was dropped in the fitting room.

793
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,380
What?

794
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,460
Oh, gosh. You have it with you.

795
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,130
It looked the same,

796
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,099
so I thought you dropped it.

797
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,400
I see.

798
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,969
That is the thing, right?

799
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,800
The video recording
of the second surgery.

800
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,139
Hey.

801
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,340
What are you talking about?

802
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,210
What video?

803
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:05,510
It's right.

804
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,519
You clearly told me
that it recorded...

805
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,789
everything that happened
during the operation.

806
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,599
What?

807
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,000
Now the son has the video recording
of the second surgery?

808
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,840
Yes.

809
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,739
Then what will happen to us?

810
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,440
Will we be sued?

811
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,579
No.

812
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,280
It will be the other way around.

813
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,789
Really?

814
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:46,420
Gosh, that's good.

815
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,119
See? I told you
everything would be okay.

816
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,159
So what is Manager Jang going to do?

817
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,500
This is from my heart, Dr. Seo.

818
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:01,369
Will you take it?

819
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:11,550
I'm sorry, doctor.

820
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,750
I was mistaken.

821
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,719
I should've been more thorough.

822
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:21,559
I felt bad about
my father's condition.

823
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:24,090
And I heard things weren't
getting any better...

824
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:26,730
even after the second surgery.

825
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,369
That made me lose my mind.

826
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,800
I'm really sorry.

827
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:37,440
The Minister is enduring so well.

828
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,940
I'll do my best until the end.

829
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:44,679
Well, then.

830
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:52,090
- Sir.
- Yes?

831
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:56,829
This is the video recording
of the second surgery.

832
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:59,159
I thought you'd need it.

833
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,130
(Geodae Medical Center)

834
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,070
Thank you.

835
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,679
Joo Young.

836
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:31,760
Happy ending suits the best
for Doldam Hospital.

837
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:34,360
You think so?

838
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,269
That's also the reason why
we refused other opportunities...

839
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,500
and chose to stay here.

840
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,170
I only hope...

841
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:46,269
that Dr. Seo and Dr. Cha
will also someday learn that.

842
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,409
Me too.

843
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,409
That reminds me. How's Dr. Cha?

844
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,050
Oh, gosh. I must be insane.

845
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:01,119
Oh, no. Why did I do such a thing?

846
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,230
Just why...

847
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,599
Dr. Cha.

848
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:21,610
Yes, doctor.

849
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:29,280
I guess you have no idea
what kind of a person I am.

850
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:31,590
I don't quite follow.

851
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,730
Sorry.

852
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:17,369
I'm apologizing for before.

853
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:22,199
What I said was uncalled for.
No, I was downright mean.

854
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:26,769
I'd appreciate it if you forgot
that I even called you...

855
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:28,480
a betrayer and an opportunist.

856
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,210
Is that possible?

857
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,519
Sure, it's possible.

858
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,489
Good, then.

859
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,530
See you tomorrow.

860
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,659
Good job, Jessie.

861
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,699
Give me five.

862
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,639
What about the CT scan?

863
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:05,039
Was it not checked
prior to the surgery?

864
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,909
The doctor asked you a question.

865
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:09,239
His condition was critical
and BP was low.

866
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,809
- Yes, come in.
- Did you not even take one?

867
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,829
What's this?

868
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:27,559
- Your 10,000 dollars.
- Sorry?

869
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,800
But it hasn't been a week yet.

870
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,369
Are you declining?

871
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,769
Okay, fine. I'll keep it until then.

872
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,579
How many months
worth of salary is this?

873
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
I'm lending you that
out of my own pocket.

874
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,309
You will repay me
1,000 dollars a month.

875
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,079
Hold on a second.

876
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,750
1,000 a month
to pay back 10,000 dollars?

877
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:55,420
You'll be stuck with me
for at least 10 months.

878
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,659
Are you good with that?

879
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,130
Hold on. Did you just scoff?

880
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,969
It was a bit cheesy, that's all.

881
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,469
The more professional term
would be pompous, not cheesy.

882
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,969
You could also...

883
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,340
call it romantic.

884
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,690
Get going then.

885
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,690
Yes, sir.

886
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,579
Weird people.

887
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,789
A weird hospital.

888
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,230
As an adult, I'd like to apologize.

889
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,530
I'm truly sorry, Dr. Seo.

890
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:17,909
Weird...

891
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:21,840
elders.

892
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,380
Hi, there, Woo Jin.

893
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,949
Here you are.

894
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:34,019
Do you know what hoops
we went through to find you?

895
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,219
- How have you been?
- And then...

896
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,389
there is my darn situation.

897
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,000
Will I...

898
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,829
be able to find the answer?

899
01:03:02,019 --> 01:03:03,949
(Dr. Romantic 2)

900
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:07,159
Are you kidding me?
A letter of dismissal?

901
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,989
Will you join my cause?

902
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,789
I heard a fun rumor.

903
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,059
Is it true that
you're coming to Doldam?

904
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,300
Will you be able to handle it?

905
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,329
Are you trying to scare me away?

906
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:17,829
A whole family committed suicide?

907
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:18,869
A patient can choose...

908
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:20,199
- his or her doctor,
- Stop it!

909
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:22,670
but I learned that
a doctor can't choose its patient.

910
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,469
What's wrong with you, Dr. Seo?

911
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:27,380
I'm sorry,
but I can't treat this patient.

912
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,239
What did you just say?

913
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,480
The patient isn't responding!

914
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:32,849
You'll help him, right?

915
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,150
Promise me you'll help him.
