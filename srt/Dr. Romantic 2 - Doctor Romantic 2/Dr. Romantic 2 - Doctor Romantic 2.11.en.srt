1
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,049
Yes, I had surgery
late into the night again.

2
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,189
Can't say. I'm not sure
if I'll be free this weekend.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
What about you?

4
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,570
Is that so? That's nice.

5
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,340
- Master Kim?
- Master Kim!

6
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,840
All right then.

7
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,310
I'll call you at the residence.
Okay, bye.

8
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,579
Master Kim! My goodness, Master Kim!

9
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,010
My gosh, what happened?

10
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,579
What should we do?

11
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,180
Master Kim, are you okay?

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,280
Master Kim!

13
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,420
(Dr. Shim Hye Jin)

14
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,390
Hello? What's up?

15
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,170
What? Who collapsed?

16
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,620
Did I keep you waiting?

17
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,219
No, I just got off work myself.

18
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,750
But I think we have
another emergency patient.

19
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,659
Let's lie him down.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
Set up two IV lines
and give him IV hydration.

21
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,069
- Okay.
- How are his vitals?

22
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,539
110 over 70. 110bpm.

23
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,939
His body temperature is 39.1°C.

24
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,810
Connect an IV for propacetamol.

25
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,280
- I want to see his FAST.
- Okay.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,639
I also need a suture kit.

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,710
Here you go.

28
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,349
What's going on, Manager Jang?
Do we have another patient?

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,219
Hey, Mr. Park.
This is really bad.

30
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,729
It's Master Kim.

31
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,729
What's going on?

32
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,370
What happened to him?

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,539
I think he got injured
in the bus accident.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,539
I can't believe he performed surgery
in this condition.

35
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,580
Fortunately, he doesn't have
internal bleeding, so don't worry.

36
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,180
But just to be sure,

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,710
let's have him take an X-ray
after the suture is done.

38
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,150
Okay.

39
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,449
Cut.

40
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,949
Tape, please.

41
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,930
Let's move him. Please get ready.

42
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,129
Okay.

43
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm fine.

44
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,639
- Master Kim.
- Master Kim.

45
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,710
Master Kim.

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Sir.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,379
There's no need to cause a fuss.

48
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,449
I don't need...

49
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,050
to take an X-ray.

50
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,460
But you might have a rib fracture.

51
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,759
You should get it checked.

52
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,689
If it was that serious,

53
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,560
I would've felt something by now.

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,400
You shouldn't move around yet.
Lie back down.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll lie down in my office.

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,310
Sir, please. You should sleep
in the patient's room tonight.

57
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,439
Let us keep an eye on you
until tomorrow.

58
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,280
He's right.
You should listen to him.

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,849
It's okay. I won't die.

60
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,150
Will you please listen to us?

61
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,629
Don't be too startled.
She's just setting things straight.

62
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,759
Do you think we're worried
that you might die?

63
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,459
Just let us check your condition!

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,100
We're only asking you...

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,899
to get hospitalized for a day!
Why are you being so stubborn?

66
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,170
You're only making it hard
for everyone!

67
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,170
I can take care of myself, Ms. Oh.

68
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,569
If you could take
such good care of yourself,

69
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,439
why were you collapsed
in your darn office?

70
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,410
That's because I was just...

71
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,779
If you got injured,
you should've told us...

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,889
that you got hurt...

73
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,120
and let us treat you first!

74
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,959
Do you think
you're the only doctor here?

75
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,089
How could you be foolish enough...

76
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,160
to keep it a secret
until things got out of hand?

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,529
Look at everyone!

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,629
They can't even go home
because of you!

79
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,000
Look at how worried they are!

80
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,970
My gosh, I'm really okay.
What's wrong with everyone?

81
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,040
Your doctor will judge
if you're okay or not.

82
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,449
You're a patient right now,

83
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,550
so just listen to your doctor.

84
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,750
You know how difficult it can be
when patients don't cooperate.

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,089
So I'll keep it short.

86
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,949
Please show everyone
how you should behave...

87
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,959
as a patient!

88
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,730
Okay, Master Kim?

89
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,899
End of situation.

90
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,839
And like always, Ms. Oh has won.

91
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,050
I'll lie down.

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Okay.

93
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,980
Gosh, it hurts. Slowly.

94
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,459
We're going to move him now.

95
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,639
He really has a knack
for surprising people.

96
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,170
Let's get back to work.

97
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,779
Let's go.

98
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,089
Ms. Oh.

99
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,129
Are you okay?

100
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,509
So?

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,610
How is Boo Yong Joo doing right now?

102
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,579
Okay.

103
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,399
Keep going. Tell me what happened.

104
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,649
(Personnel Record)

105
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:32,620
(Manager: Jang Gi Tae)

106
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,959
(Head Nurse: Oh Myung Sim)

107
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,430
(Surgeon: Nam Do Il)

108
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,569
(Surgeon: Seo Woo Jin)

109
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,079
This jerk.

110
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,189
Does it hurt anywhere else
other than the sutured area?

111
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,819
I was in a rolling bus,

112
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,730
so what do you think?
My entire body aches.

113
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,000
Does it hurt anywhere else
other than your bruises?

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,199
No.

115
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:16,129
Dr. Bae, you told me
the X-ray came out fine.

116
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,670
Yes, it was fine.

117
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,939
What about your hand?
You had a problem with it in the OR.

118
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,779
I just had a small cramp.

119
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,279
Do you have any other symptoms...

120
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,449
other than CTS?

121
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,549
You seemed to have a little problem
with your elbow as well.

122
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,019
That is, if I wasn't mistaken.

123
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,320
What do you want to know?

124
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,059
Your current condition.

125
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,899
I don't think it requires
the attention of a general surgeon.

126
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,100
But I'm your doctor in charge.

127
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:52,399
If you tell me your symptoms,
it'll help with the diagnosis.

128
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,870
It's late. You guys should go.

129
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,509
- Sir.
- You said I'm a patient.

130
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,480
And a patient should get good rest.

131
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,049
Stop bothering me
and get back to work.

132
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,220
I want to get some rest.

133
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,399
What are you all still doing here?

134
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,870
I wanted to hear...

135
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,899
how Master Kim is doing.
Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep.

136
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,440
I was eating dinner nearby.

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,840
And I got a call just as I was
about to have my first bite.

138
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,340
I just left my food on the table
and ran out of the restaurant.

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,649
How is Master Kim?

140
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,210
The X-ray came out fine.
His fever went down as well.

141
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,320
I think he'll be fine
once the stitches heal.

142
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,789
- Thank goodness.
- I'm so relieved.

143
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
But he still needs to get good rest.

144
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,299
So we should let him rest tonight.

145
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,960
Okay, let's do that.

146
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,529
He doesn't like it
when people cause a fuss.

147
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,370
If he finds out that we're here,
it'll be enough to stress him out.

148
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,600
Okay, I guess we should all...

149
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,070
go home for tonight.

150
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,639
Okay, great work.

151
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,309
- Great work.
- Goodbye.

152
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,610
- Bye.
- Bye.

153
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,909
Bye.

154
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,769
What does he mean to you?

155
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,409
- What do you mean?
- I'm talking about Master Kim.

156
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,409
What does he mean to you, Ms. Oh,

157
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,149
and all the other staff
at Doldam Hospital?

158
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,149
I suddenly want to know
how much he means to everyone.

159
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,960
(Name: Master Kim,
Doctor: Seo Woo Jin)

160
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,539
My goodness.
I can't stand lying still.

161
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,639
How's the bed?

162
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,639
Is it uncomfortable?

163
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,879
It's fine.

164
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,580
I think I'll sleep well tonight.

165
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,850
I'm sorry about earlier.

166
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,049
What?

167
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,919
I shouldn't have...

168
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,990
yelled at you in front of everyone.

169
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,429
It's okay.

170
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,470
Not a single thing
you said was untrue.

171
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Your collapsing...

172
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,639
is like Doldam Hospital collapsing.

174
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,120
They'll run a few tests
tomorrow morning.

175
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,289
Sleep well.

176
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,759
Okay.

177
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,960
Goodnight, Ms. Oh.

178
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,450
It's me.

179
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,820
The task you suggested.

180
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,330
I'll take it.

181
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,929
I'll head over there tomorrow.

so tired and lethargic?

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,529
I must have gone crazy.

186
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,399
I ate all this?

187
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,919
Good morning.

188
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,419
Ah Reum, you're here early.

189
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,460
Did someone eat here
late last night?

190
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,990
I guess so.

191
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,929
Couldn't they at least clean up?

192
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:27,600
Some people eat
and others are left to clean up.

193
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:28,830
Right, Ah Reum?

194
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,870
Right. I'll throw it away for you.

195
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,639
No, I can manage that just fine.

196

What?

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,289
Did you eat something
in here last night?

No, I didn't.

and do an oxygen titration,
so watch him closely.

After the transfusion, her
hemoglobin count went up to 10.1.

But the hemovac drainage color

and I feel great, so what for?

249
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,450
You must've heard about
the tests this morning.

250
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,720
I was just slightly hurt,

251
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,289
and I had a fever
because I caught a cold.

252
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,230
Why should I be tested for that?

253
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,230
Are you that bored?

254
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,230
Get out of the way.

255
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,029
If you're that free,

256
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,539
check on more patients.

257
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,710
Is it because of them?

258
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,480
What are you talking about?

259
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,380
The reason you
keep hiding your injuries.

260
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,880
It's because of the people here.

261
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,490
Because these people
can't do anything without you,

262
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,289
and you can't afford to get sick.

263
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,289
That's why you keep hiding it.

264
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,529
In case they get worried
and anxious.

265
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,000
But...

266
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm not sure if that's good for you.

267
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,569
A relationship in which
everyone relies solely on you.

268
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,509
I'm not sure if
that's right or good.

269
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,609
And you are...

270
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,049
hiding your pain to live up to that.
It's...

271
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,720
What about it?

272
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,119
It's old-fashioned.

273
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,059
The technical term for that
is "a darn show-off".

274
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,000
- Another term is...
- Get diagnosed.

275
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,329
And get treated.

276
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,130
Okay?

277
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,529
Is Woo Jin ghosting
your messages or something?

278
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Beats me.

279
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,930
I did text him
to call me when he gets in,

280
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,230
but he has no response.

281
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,710
Why are you here to see him though?

282
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,440
Did you know that it's your
fourth time asking me that?

283
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,309
Is that so?

284
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:51,849
What's the matter?

285
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:54,619
Are you worried
that I'd hurt him in any way?

286
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,119
No, of course not.

287
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,619
He must be running later
than usual today.

288
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,430
He should've called by now.

289
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,660
Give him a call yourself then.

290
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,829
- Right now?
- Yes.

291
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,009
Right, then I'll give him a call.

292
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,240
Dr. Seo.

293
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,950
Dr. Seo?

294
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,119
He isn't here at the moment.

295
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,190
Do you have any idea
what the time is?

296
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,819
Where on earth are you?

297
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm in the ER.

298
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,289
What? You're still home?

299
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,930
Eun Jae, what are you talking about?

300
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,529
We bumped into each other
in the staff room.

301
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,799
Don't you remember?

302
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,869
What's with your voice though?

303
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,269
Are you sick?

304
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,640
- Me?
- Describe your condition.

305
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,380
You have a fever
and your body is aching all over?

306
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,609
Eun Jae, you're scaring me.

307
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,509
Gosh, I see.

308
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,380
You probably won't
make it to work today.

309
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,619
What a shame.

310
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,890
Hyun Joon came by to see you today.

311
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,730
Who can blame you when you're sick?

312
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,400
Yes, of course.
I'll tell Hyun Joon that...

313
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,029
so get some rest.

314
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,099
Sure.

315
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,640
What's wrong?

316
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,880
That was Dr. Cha,

317
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,039
- but she was acting weird.
- Dr. Cha?

318
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,049
A visitor came from Seoul...

319
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,920
and she escorted him
to the staff room.

320
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,150
Why though?
What made her sound so weird?

321
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,059
Woo Jin is sick today, Hyun Joon.

322
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,130
Is that so?

323
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,759
He must have a bad cold.

324
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,359
You see, this hospital might seem...

325
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,470
like the slowest place on earth,

326
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,269
but it's the opposite.

327
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,170
Trauma patients come flooding in...

328
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,910
and he had to perform at least
two emergency operations a day.

329
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,339
I guess the exhaustion
caught up with him.

330
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,480
I'm terribly sorry about this.

331
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,720
What did he say
when you told him I was here?

332
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,450
Sorry?

333
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,819
- What did he say?
- Oh...

334
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,029
Well, he was extremely thrilled...

335
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,329
to hear that you came by.

336
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,029
It's why he feels terrible...

337
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,569
for not being able
to meet you in person.

338
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,640
He said he'll visit you in Seoul...

339
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
as soon as he can.

340
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,039
Woo Jin said that?

341
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,339
He feels awful about this?

342
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,079
Yes, of course.

343
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,880
What is it?

344
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,619
Is something the matter?

345
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,390
You must think I'm a fool.

346
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,089
I don't follow, Hyun Joon.

347
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,660
You think little of me
because my reputation was tarnished.

348
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,700
What? Of course not.
When did I ever say that?

349
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,000
Give me your phone then.

350
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,910
Why?

351
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,609
You said you just talked to Woo Jin.

352
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,380
I'd like to call that number myself.

353
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,950
Give me your phone.

354
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,299
He's not here either.

355
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,980
Woo Jin, there you are.

356
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,980
What's wrong?
Do we have an emergency?

357
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,549
No, but you're needed
in the staff room.

358
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,720
The person you called
is unavailable.

359
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,059
(Seo Woo Jin)

360
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,069
The person you called
is unavailable.

361
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,190
Woo Jin?

362
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,900
You said you had a cold.
How come you're at work?

363
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,700
How's your fever?
Are you still shivering?

364
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,700
Why on earth did you come here?

365
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,539
Get out. Nothing good
will come out of this.

366
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,170
Just get going.

367
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,039
Leave us.

368
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,779
What are you going to do?

369
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:53,319
It's fine. You can leave us.

370
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,700
Are you all right?

371
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,369
Your phone call left me worried,

372
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,970
so I came looking for you.

373
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,970
This is bad.

374
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,299
Those two shouldn't come in contact.

375
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,740
Why not? Who is that man?

376
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,039
Well, at Samjin Hospital,

377
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,710
the two used to work together.

378
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,250
Samjin Hospital?

379
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,069
I heard that Boo Yong Joo was hurt.

380
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,539
From what I heard,
it's nothing serious.

381
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,349
Are you aware of
his possible carpal tunnel syndrome?

382
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,380
Yes.

383
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,890
But still, you didn't
inform me of that.

384
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm disappointed.

385
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,160
I thought we were on the same side.

386
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,430
Excuse me for saying this,
but I don't side with people.

387
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,500
What I trust are
my hands, the art of medicine,

388
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,599
and my beliefs.

389
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,740
The people at Doldam are
way more competent than I expected.

390
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,549
It'd be a good idea to have them
transfer to Mirae Hospital.

391
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,549
Do you really believe
that's an option?

392
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,460
That day,

393
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,130
you told him to choose
one or the other.

394
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,029
Which will it be?

395
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,529
Your livelihood...

396
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,630
or your pride?

397
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,900
I'd like to start a game.

398
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,779
Mr. Park, what are you doing here?

399
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,390
What's on your mind?

400
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:11,990
It's Master Kim.

401
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,890
I'm worried about him.

402
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,970
What if this is our fault, Ms. Oh?

403
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,940
What do you mean?

404
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,970
The reason you
keep hiding your injuries.

405
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,680
It's because of the people here.

406
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,210
Because these people
can't do anything without you,

407
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,750
and you can't afford to get sick.

408
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,049
That's why you keep hiding it.

409
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,190
In case they get worried
and anxious.

410
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,519
What if that's why
he keeps overexerting himself?

411
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,190
What if that's true?

412
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes, Seo Jung.

413
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,720
Right.

414
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,029
Well, I just opened the file...

415
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,759
you sent me yesterday.

416
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,160
Right.

417
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,970
The article regarding
necrotizing mediastinitis...

418
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,329
was quite interesting if you ask me.

419
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:33,900
Is that so?

420
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,640
Then you'd have the progress report
by next week.

421
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,809
Right.

422
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,049
Of course. Everyone's fine here.
Same old, same old.

423
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:51,819
Yes.

424
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,119
We're all in good shape too.

425
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,400
Worry more about your own health,
Dr. Yoon.

426
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,930
Sure, keep in touch.

427
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:28,390
(Oddball Project)

428
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,170
Why aren't they saying anything?

429
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,440
It's making me even more nervous.

430
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,240
Should we call Mr. Koo?

431
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:48,750
How long has it been
since the incident?

432
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,710
Over a year?

433
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,519
It's been just over nine months.

434
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,579
Right.

435
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,250
I had business to take care of here,

436
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,130
but then I found out
you worked here too.

437
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,160
I was curious
as to how your life was,

438
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,430
but you don't seem bad at all.

439
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,299
Is that so?

440
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,400
Haven't you been wondering about me?

441
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,539
How have you been?

442
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,680
My life is a mess, that's what.

443
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,309
My medical license
was suspended for three years...

444
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,119
and I lost the house...

445
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,920
to pay back the loan
I took out for the hospital.

446
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,789
My credibility plummeted...

447
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,849
and my marriage ended.

448
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,289
It must've been hard.

449
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,099
So have you been making enough here?

450
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,940
Did you pay back all your debt?

451
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,109
Seriously?

452
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,140
Are you still being chased
by those loan sharks?

453
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,680
If you have nothing more to say,
I'll get back to work.

454
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,579
Do you want me to recommend you
to a nicer place?

455
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,519
He's approaching Dr. Seo.

456
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,289
- Why?
- Should I enter?

457
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,859
It's nothing big,

458
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:16,769
but...

459
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,440
I've been connecting
decent doctors...

460
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,940
to those that need them.

461
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,569
Call me a scout if you want.

462
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:28,309
I'm in connection with
a few rich hospitals, you see.

463
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,180
In terms of salary, you'll receive
at least 150 percent more.

464
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,180
And that's negotiable, of course.

465
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,789
Just 30 percent of your
first yearly salary comes to me.

466
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,190
- What do you say?
- I'm not interested.

467
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,690
Okay, fine. 20 percent.

468
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,390
You get
the family-and-friend discount.

469
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,359
You should look elsewhere.

470
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,500
You punk.

471
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,170
You haven't changed a bit.

472
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,609
You don't feel sorry at all,

473
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,509
do you?

474
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,309
I can say that same for you.

475
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,550
You have no remorse...

476
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,489
for what you did.

477
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,159
Do what you came here to do then.

478
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,900
Woo Jin, are you all right?

479
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,239
Are you okay?

480
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,769
Dr. Seo, are you all right?

481
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,039
What is this?

482
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,579
We didn't know
how things would escalate.

483
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,679
I asked him here, just in case.

484
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,949
Just give me the signal.

485
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,750
Do you want me to take care of him?

486
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,260
No, it's fine.
You can go back to work.

487
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,349
Didn't you read my text?

488
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,980
I can't believe
you just barged in there like that.

489
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,480
I had a plan in motion...

490
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,849
to cover for you, you know.

491
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,289
Anyway, what did Hyun Joon want?

492
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,760
Is he here
to talk to you specifically?

493
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,260
How did he know you were here?

494
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,329
He can sure hold a grudge.

495
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,559
I can't believe...

496
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,730
he sought you out
after all this time.

497
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,400
What did he say?

498
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,469
Did he swear at you?

499
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,739
Verbal abuse or threats
are enough...

500
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,480
to call the police.

501
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,480
That's right. Tell me.
You can tell me everything.

502
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,250
Do you need a lawyer?

503
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,619
I can introduce you
to my mom's best friend.

504
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:51,349
- Eun Jae.
- Don't worry about the cost.

505
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,489
I'll ask for a discount.

506
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,030
I'll make sure that you get
the minimum retainer.

507
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,659
If it's still too much,
I'll lend you some money.

508
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,130
Why do you keep sticking
your nose in my business?

509
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,130
Because...

510
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,739
I heard the rumors.

511
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:12,539
Everyone's been
pointing their finger at you,

512
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,579
but Hyun Joon violated the rules.

513
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,780
He received money under the table,

514
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,550
used excessive treatment,
and had someone else operate.

515
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,949
Isn't he embarrassed
to call himself a senior doctor?

516
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,420
We can't blindly cover
for our colleagues, you know.

517
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,090
I truly believe...

518
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,630
that other doctors should
be more strict in this matter.

519
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,860
So there's no need
to be intimidated.

520
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,800
Age doesn't give
everyone seniority...

521
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,530
and respect should be earned.
All right?

522
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,769
I get that,

523
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,940
but why are you
so invested in my business?

524
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,070
How thick are you?

525
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,510
I'm worried about you!

526
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:56,949
Would you...

527
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,659
feel burdened in any way
if I said that?

528
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,829
Then I apologize.

529
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,840
It's not exactly burdening.

530
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,940
Oh, good.

531
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,210
Still, it would make me...

532
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,940
toss and turn for a few nights.

533
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,579
"Does she have feelings
for me or not?"

534
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:29,219
"Am I supposed to wait for her?"

535
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,460
That's what I'd be thinking.

536
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,989
If I said that,

537
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,300
am I crossing the line?

538
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,349
How are his vitals?

539
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,880
130 over 80, 125bpm.

540
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,280
His temperature is at 37.2℃.

541
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,780
Give him a liter of normal saline...

542
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,849
and half a bottle of pethidine
on the side.

543
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,250
Mr. Park?

544
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,260
Yes, Ms. Oh.

545
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,260
Sir, I'll examine you
while we prepare the IV.

546
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,590
Please roll over on your back.

547
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,130
Lift your knees up for me.

548
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,329
I'll check your abdomen.

549
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,570
I see you've received
surgery before.

550
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,940
What kind of surgery was it?

551
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,070
Last summer, I got surgery...

552
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,280
to get my gallstones removed.

553
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,679
Do you think something went wrong
with the surgery?

554
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,309
No, I'm sure
that's not what this is.

555
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,519
If something went wrong,

556
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,679
you would've had symptoms
right after the surgery.

557
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,150
Let me examine your condition.

558
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,329
This looks like panperitonitis.

559
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,409
Sir, we're going to give you a shot.

560
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,380
It's an opioid pain reliever,

561
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,980
so you might get dizzy and nauseous.

562
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,650
- Let us know if you feel that way.
- Okay.

563
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,349
Please run pre-surgery tests
while giving him the shot.

564
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,449
Let's go ahead and take an X-ray.

565
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,489
Lie down comfortably.

566
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,670
What's going on?

567
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,889
Okay, I'll get ready right away.

568
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,860
Dr. Yang, leave everything
on the table once you're done.

569
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,599
I'll clean the dishes
when I come back.

570
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,760
Another ER patient?

571
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,630
He has panperitonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

572
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,070
I'm done eating.

573
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,840
Why don't you clean the dishes now?

574
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,449
A 47-year-old male...

575
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,079
with panperitonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

576
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,679
His vitals are stable.

577
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,719
Any underlying diseases?

578
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,389
Six months ago, he had GB stones...

579
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:52,190
and received a cholecystectomy.

580
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,059
Then there might be
a surgical adhesion.

581
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,559
Did you call Dr. Nam?

582
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,760
Yes, I did.

583
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,860
Dr. Nam won't be here.

584
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,599
What do you mean...

585
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,070
Dr. Nam won't be here?

586
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,300
We never got a call from him.

587
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,639
It's panperitonitis
due to ulcer perforation, right?

588
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,110
I'll be in the OR, Dr. Seo.

589
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,480
Keep that in mind
as you prepare for surgery.

590
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,659
What are you saying, Dr. Yang?

591
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,829
You don't want me to work
at Doldam Hospital anymore?

592
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,630
Did I hear you correctly?

593
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,530
Yes, you did.

594
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,070
Here you go.
It's from President Park.

595
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,309
Here.

596
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,320
Bye then.

597
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,429
(Termination of Contract)

598
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,780
(Doldam Hospital)

599
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:31,190
- Is Dr. Nam not answering?
- The receiver cannot be reached.

600
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,519
No, he's not answering.

601
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,519
What if something happened?

602
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,389
Shouldn't we tell Master Kim?

603
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,329
Later.

604
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,800
I'll look into what's going on...

605
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,699
after we're done with the surgery.

606
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:49,909
As for Master Kim,

607
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:54,340
we should let him
rest for the day, Dr. Yun.

608
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,309
Okay.

609
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,820
Do you think everything is okay?

610
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:04,889
Yes, of course.

611
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,639
Hello, I'm Shim Hye Jin,
an anesthesiologist.

612
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,000
Can you tell me your name?

613
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,309
- Song Chang Gi.
- And your surgery?

614
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,940
I'm receiving surgery
for gastric perforation.

615
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,440
Let's begin the anesthetization.
This is oxygen.

616
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,280
Don't be nervous,
and take in a deep breath.

617
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,409
(Termination of Contract)

618
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,079
This is a 47-year-old
male patient...

619
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,849
with panperitonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

620
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,579
May I begin the surgery?

621
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,320
Yes, you may begin.

622
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,750
Scalpel.

623
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:14,489
Forceps.

624
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:17,829
Bovie.

625
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,170
Hey, Dr. Yang. You're a little late.

626
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,340
You're awfully nosy.

627
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:38,110
Are you even going to keep track
of when I come to work?

628
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,679
No, I was just saying hello.

629
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,789
Where is Woo Jin?

630
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,860
- He's operating on an ER patient.
- Again?

631
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,429
Why does this hospital
get so many ER patients?

632
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,030
I asked everyone to get ready
to greet the VIP patients...

633
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,300
starting from today.

634
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,730
Yes, sir.

635
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,769
Okay, I'll be right there.

636
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,010
My gosh.

637
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,780
Hey, I want you to come with me.

638
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,179
Why? I'm not a general surgeon.

639
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:13,380
Come with me
and fill in for the missing doctors.

640
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,150
Why are you pretending
like you don't understand?

641
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,590
Just do as I say.

642
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,389
Does he think he can boss me around
just because he's my senior?

643
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,329
What's taking you so long?
Aren't you going to come?

644
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:33,070
Yes, I should go.
I'll be right there.

645
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:40,210
I hate myself for being like this.

646
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,139
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

647
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,469
Dr. Park,
you have such a peculiar taste.

648
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,610
I don't get why you decided
to come here.

649
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,139
- Is this really a hospital?
- Who is he?

650
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,179
I don't know for sure.

651
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,320
But apparently, he's the son
of someone really famous.

652
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,550
My gosh, what's that?

653
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,219
Is he the founder of the hospital?

654
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,929
This is a sculpture of Hippocrates.

655
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,260
Oh, Hippocrates?

656
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,730
But why did a foreigner
come all the way here...

657
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,429
to build a hospital?

658
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,940
What? He doesn't know Hippocrates?

659
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,139
Hey.

660
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,110
I can hear you.

661
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,920
- Where should we go?
- Manager Jang.

662
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,119
Oh, okay. It's this way.
Please follow me.

663
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,699
Where is Woo Jin?

664
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,300
He's operating on an ER patient.

665
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,840
I want them at the ER station
starting from today.

666
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,869
Okay, sir.

667
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,250
Did you do what I asked you to do?

668
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,880
Yes, I gave it to him
before I came to work.

669
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,550
What are you doing here?

670
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,250
Well, he asked me to...

671
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,619
Your job is done. You can go now.

672
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,530
But I thought you wanted me
to fill in...

673
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,929
Just go, okay?

674
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,570
What's wrong with him?

675
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,769
I hate him so much.

676
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,440
They will be helping you out
starting from today.

677
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:00,250
Ms. Oh is in charge of organizing
the nurses' schedules.

678
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,980
You can't just take over like this.

679
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,090
I have no choice.

680
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,889
It's President Park's orders,
so please cooperate.

681
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,190
I'll tell Ms. Oh once she's free.
Bye then.

682
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,260
- Excuse us.
- My gosh.

683
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,869
What's going on, Dr. Yun?

684
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,570
I don't know.

685
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,110
(Oddball Project)

686
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,239
It's strangely quiet today.

687
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:04,610
(General Surgery, Family Medicine)

688
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,940
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

689
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,110
What are you doing here?

690
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,079
The hospital's so strangely quiet,

691
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,679
so I came to look.

692
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,349
Where is everyone?
I don't see anyone.

693
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,320
We have someone with panperitonitis
due to ulcer perforation

694
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,920
They'll all be in surgery.

695
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,860
A panperitonitis patient?

696
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,730
Why wasn't I called?

697
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,659
You're sick.

698
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,730
They wanted you to rest.

699
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,400
Who are those people
at the nurse station?

700
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:07,480
They're the nurses
who came with Dr. Park.

701
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,809
My point exactly.
What are they doing there?

702
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:11,949
I don't know.

703
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,750
They must be here for a reason.

704
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,519
When will you get surgery
for your CTS?

705
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,360
Let's talk about that another time.

706
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,460
Instead of dragging it on,
just get it done.

707
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,000
The sooner you recover,
the better it is for us.

708
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,230
You know that.

709
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,510
What?

710
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,679
They took over
the ER nurse's station?

711
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:43,949
Yes. Ms. Uhm and Ms. Joo
are almost out of their minds.

712
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,280
Ms. Oh let that happen?

713
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,079
She's in the OR...

714
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,650
and doesn't know about this.

715
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,420
They took over
while Ms. Oh was in the OR?

716
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,860
What a smart move.

717
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,630
Dr. Nam's not answering
his phone either today.

718
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,530
We called to notify him
of the surgery,

719
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,429
but no one can reach him after that.

720
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:05,670
I have a bad feeling about
the way things are going.

721
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:07,900
Does Master Kim know about this?

722
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,610
No. Ms. Oh said we should
give him the day off.

723
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,670
Why?

724
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,210
I don't think this is
that kind of situation.

725
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,710
Master Kim's hurt.

726
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,610
- Where?
- You didn't know?

727
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,719
He was hurt in the bus crash...

728
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:22,349
and there was a ruckus last night.

729
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,750
Where? How badly hurt
is he? Is it serious?

730
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,590
It's not that bad,

731
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,829
but Ms. Oh and Mr. Park
are very concerned about him.

732
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:33,530
They're afraid we'll burden him.

733
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,570
I see.

734
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,070
I had no idea.

735
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,710
(Master Kim)

736
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,519
Hi, Master Kim.

737
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,190
What's up?

738
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,230
Something happened at the restaurant
and I couldn't leave.

739
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:12,530
Of course, there's nothing wrong.

740
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,699
How are you feeling?

741
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,539
Ms. Oh is worried sick...

742
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:20,139
that you're already out of the ward.

743
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,449
Can't you come and
talk to her for me?

744
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:26,349
She's giving me a hard time
right now.

745
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,619
Okay. Bye.

746
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,039
Fortunately for him,
the adhesion's not too bad.

747
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,340
I'll look for the perforation first.

748
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:11,329
This is a choledochojejunostomy.

749
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:13,429
(Anastomosis of the common
bile duct to the jejunum.)

750
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:15,960
What is it?
Is anything wrong, Dr. Seo?

751
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,800
The patient said he had...

752
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,829
a cholecystectomy
because of the gallstones.

753
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,440
I think the surgeon made
a mistake with the common bile duct.

754
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,809
The common bile duct
is connected to the jejunum.

755
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,980
Did they cut off the bile duct
while removing the gallstones?

756
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,880
I think so.

757
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,019
Why? Is that a problem?

758
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:39,849
The patient didn't mention
his bile duct.

759
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,730
Let's move on, Dr. Seo.

760
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,059
What do you mean?

761
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,670
The patient could not have told
you after hearing the explanation.

762
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,739
Or...

763
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:58,010
the operating surgeon hid the truth.

764
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,639
Isn't that what you want to check?

765
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,849
Ms. Oh, record this for me.

766
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,849
- Ms. Gang.
- Okay.

767
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,260
It's being recorded.

768
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,699
Dr. Seo.

769
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,269
The panperitonitis patient.

770
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:37,050
Let's cover it up.

771
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,780
- What?
- The bile duct.

772
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,619
Let's not tell his family about it.

773
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,550
Why do you always
want to cover things up?

774
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,789
I don't know who operated on him,

775
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,190
but if the doctor
really didn't tell him,

776
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,730
then he or she
will be liable for it.

777
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,400
One should pay if they did wrong.

778
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,199
It's not like the patient
suffered from a side effect.

779
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,400
It'll go away
if you just keep quiet.

780
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:03,000
Don't make a fuss out of it.

781
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,739
A patient has the right to know...

782
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,409
what happened to their body.

783
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
And the doctor should inform them.

784
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,480
Do you want to be in trouble
like you did at Samjin Hospital?

785
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,480
It'll obviously make you...

786
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,190
look like the bad guy and traitor.

787
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,489
Let it slide and move on, okay?

788
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,030
I'm grateful that you care for me,

789
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,800
but I'll deal with my problems.

790
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,000
He's such a punk.

791
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:36,099
I don't think you have to worry.

792
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,710
I think that...

793
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:44,349
he's much more
clear-headed than you.

794
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,730
Yes. I understand.

795
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,929
I'll come down now.

796
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,440
Something urgent came up
and I have to go downstairs.

797
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,679
Manager Jang,
you look after him for me.

798
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,940
Don't you worry.

799
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:21,420
- Dr. Yang, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

800
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:31,889
First of all,
shall we tour the wards?

801
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,630
Before we do, can you
give me that girl's name?

802
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,659
What girl?

803
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,369
Who?

804
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,210
How are things going?

805
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,239
It's touch-and-go.

806
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,130
What is going on here?

807
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,000
Will you explain?

808
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,469
We're here on
the president's orders.

809
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,570
I never heard of such an order.

810
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,570
Okay?

811
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,550
Talk to Mr. Heo.

812
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,380
We have nothing more to say.

813
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,320
Yes, that's right.
It's the president's order.

814
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,320
Even if that's true,
this is unheard of.

815
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,059
How could you bring in new nurses...

816
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,929
and put them to work...

817
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:42,400
while I was away
without informing me?

818
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,130
I get that you're upset.

819
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:48,969
But they won't get in the way
of the doctors and nurses.

820
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,010
They'll mostly take calls.

821
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,210
Take calls?

822
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,340
What does that mean?

823
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,079
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

824
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,150
A man fell from a roof
while fixing it...

825
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,750
and fractured his knee.

826
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,820
I'm sorry but we're full.

827
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,420
Take him to another hospital.

828
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,960
Another hospital?

829
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,429
Isn't that Doldam Hospital?

830
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:15,760
It is,

831
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,099
but we can't take
emergency trauma patients.

832
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,530
Go to another hospital.

833
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,599
What...

834
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,809
What kind of nonsense task...

835
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:29,409
Dr. Park's VIP patients
will start coming in nonstop.

836
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:31,010
You'll spend more time...

837
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,980
in the OR than the ER.

838
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,079
You're short-staffed already...

839
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,619
and have only two ORs.

840
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:39,949
Isn't it the right strategy to
reduce emergency trauma cases?

841
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,420
Listen, Mr. Heo.

842
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,030
Doldam Hospital never turns away...

843
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,059
sick or injured people.

844
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,429
And we don't leave them
to wander between hospitals.

845
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,869
For years, we have
never operated like that.

846
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,070
But in one single snap,
you'll ruin...

847
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,010
our reputation like this?

848
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,940
It wasn't my order,
but President Park's.

849
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,110
You can make a complaint,
but that won't change anything.

850
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,130
I'm sorry, sir.

851
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,539
Hold on.

852
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,869
Are you Mr. Park Eun Tak?

853
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:34,940
Do I know you?

854
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,199
Did the surgery go well?

855
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,469
Yes. How has your day been?

856
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:06,309
Well, I stopped by
the emergency room and...

857
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:08,710
Wait. What's that?

858
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:11,880
It's the recording
of my patient's surgery.

859
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,780
His gallbladder was operated on
at another hospital,

860
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,179
but his bile duct
also had been cut off.

861
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:18,050
I wanted to check with the patient.

862
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:21,820
Another surgeon must've
swept his mistake under the rug.

863
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,130
Talk about being
unprofessional and immoral.

864
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,030
We don't know for sure yet.

865
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,199
All right. Go for it then.

866
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:30,699
Good luck.

867
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,519
You've got to be kidding me.

868
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,079
"Good luck"? Seriously?

869
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,659
What's with these two fists?
This is mortifying!

870
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,760
Yes, Mom, it's me.

871
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,119
What's going on?

872
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:32,130
I asked the family...

873
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,360
without giving away any facts.

874
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,929
They're not aware
of the bile duct being cut off.

875
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,099
Let's...

876
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,809
talk in private.

877
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,039
(ICU)

878
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,119
Ms. Joo, my patient
who needs physical therapy...

879
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,360
Please tell him that...

880
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,730
he needs to leave
if he won't receive it.

881
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,300
Yes, doctor.

882
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,269
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

883
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,409
I'm afraid we can't accept
any patients. I'm sorry.

884
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,619
So here you are.

885
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,500
What do you want?

886
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,730
You should be proud of yourself
for egging Dr. Seo on...

887
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,699
because that has gotten him
in a big mess.

888
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,170
What were you going to do with that?

889
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,880
I was going to inform the patient.

890
01:02:57,179 --> 01:02:58,909
But there weren't any side effects.

891
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:01,780
The bile duct was mistakenly cut
by his doctor.

892
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,389
Are you saying
that the patient is unaware of it?

893
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,519
It was tied back perfectly...

894
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,389
and it won't affect his life.

895
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:14,900
Let's say you hit someone
with your car.

896
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:17,969
Just because the victim
is alive and well...

897
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,570
doesn't mean you can take off...

898
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,500
without apologizing.

899
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,010
Revealing the truth...

900
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,179
might lead to an innocent doctor
getting burned.

901
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,780
If that was the case,
that doctor should've come clean.

902
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,909
It wouldn't have been a big deal...

903
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,710
if he had taken responsibility.

904
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,750
In what way?

905
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,320
Being humiliated
in trial after trial...

906
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:42,090
up to the point where he's mentally
and physically exhausted?

907
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,659
Then he'll have to pay a fine
of thousands of dollars...

908
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,760
just to end up in a state...

909
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,400
where he can't function
as a doctor anymore.

910
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,030
Is that the so-called
accountability you mean?

911
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,070
Doctors who should be in hospitals
are dragged to court,

912
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,909
and instead of writing
medical research papers,

913
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:00,710
they have to spend hours
reading up on the law.

914
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,610
Is that what you call
as accountability?

915
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,650
So?

916
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:11,489
I should sweep this under the rug?

917
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,820
I already found out
who the previous surgeon was...

918
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:18,159
and I will call that doctor myself
and say my piece.

919
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:22,530
What's important is
the doctor's remorse anyway.

920
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,800
I'd like for us doctors
to look our for each other...

921
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,340
and deal with this in a way
that doesn't harm...

922
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:31,409
the reputation and authority
of doctors.

923
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:33,840
Covering up for others
saves our reputations...

924
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,750
and concealing the truth
helps us maintain our authority.

925
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,380
Is that it?

926
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,119
We live in a world where people...

927
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,519
are waiting to take
a bite out of you.

928
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:51,289
Shouldn't we have our own fence...

929
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:53,260
where we can feel safe and secure?

930
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,199
A place where
people like me who don't obey...

931
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,269
get kicked out of?

932
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,800
You already know
what it feels like...

933
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,199
to be kicked to the curb,

934
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
so don't make
the same mistake twice,

935
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,210
Dr. Seo.

936
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:15,619
Hand it over.

937
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,489
Now.

938
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,670
Give it to me.

939
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,269
How much should I tell them?

940
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,739
Yes, just stick to the facts...

941
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:41,280
and what you saw.

942
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:44,250
Be consistent even
in the operation room.

943
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,349
No.

944
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,550
I'll hold onto this.

945
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:53,920
You know who the doctor was?

946
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:56,889
Then tell whoever it is
to inform the patient.

947
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,630
That doctor...

948
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,059
should explain
the original mistake...

949
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,630
and the lack of explanation.

950
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,070
Seo Woo Jin!

951
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:08,070
I will wait until tomorrow evening.

952
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:11,969
As a doctor myself,
I'd at least do that much.

953
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,980
Do you know
who the operating surgeon is?

954
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:23,079
Must I know?

955
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,019
I feel like you should.

956
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,860
Who is it?

957
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,469
Cha Eun Jae.

958
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,880
My father is a doctor.

959
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,780
Really?

960
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,250
My brother is one
and so is my sister.

961
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,719
Come in.

962
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,100
(Dr. Romantic 2)

963
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,170
Park Min Guk has probably already
started the reshuffling process.

964
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,109
I want him removed.

965
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,579
Why do you keep
putting them up against one another?

966
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:32,250
That weasel.

967
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,819
For the time being,
we won't accept trauma patients.

968
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,850
Will we have our Friday back again?

969
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,819
Does covering up
for fellow doctors...

970
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,319
dignify us as doctors too?

971
01:08:41,619 --> 01:08:42,760
Is that your answer?

972
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:44,789
Why aren't you intervening,
Master Kim?

973
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:47,800
This time,
we might actually lose someone.

974
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:51,369
Can you people take responsibility
for Seo Woo Jin's life?

975
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,729
I'm sorry, Woo Jin.
