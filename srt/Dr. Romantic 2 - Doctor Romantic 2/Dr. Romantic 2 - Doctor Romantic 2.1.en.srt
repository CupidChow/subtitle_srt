1
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,820
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,189
(Area Under Construction)

3
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,659
(Safety First)

4
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,030
Sorry.

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm sorry
but this section is blocked.

6
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,310
Woo Jin, sorry I'm late! Get going.

7
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,500
Hello,

8
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,699
I'm Park Min Guk
from Geodae Hospital.

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,740
The live procedure
you'll be watching today...

10
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,939
is the laparoscopic
pancreatico-duodenectomy.

11
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,110
The patient is
a 56-year-old male.

12
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,520
A 5cm sized cancer
was spotted in his pancreas head.

13
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,419
Normally in this case,

14
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,889
an anastomosis is conducted
with a mini-laparotomy.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,060
However, today, I will be conducting
the entire procedure...

16
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,860
within his abdominal cavity...

17
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,159
which is known as
the totally-laparoscopic operation.

18
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,830
Let me introduce you
to the surgical team.

19
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,599
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

20
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,699
I'm sorry. Let me through.

21
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,569
- Bovie.
- Sorry.

22
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,710
This is Dr. Jang.

23
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,310
Gosh, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,409
This is Dr. Lee.

25
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,710
This is anesthesiologist
Shim Hye Jin.

26
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,449
Let the procedure begin then.

27
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,689
Scalpel.

28
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,360
Wait, hold on!

29
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,560
Darn.

30
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,270
- Give me back my leg.
- Sorry?

31
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,139
I want my leg back.

32
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,639
Give me back my leg. Where is it?

33
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,310
Next, I will dissect
the porta hepatis.

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,550
When peeling the layers,
it's important to keep in mind...

35
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,949
the variation of the hepatic artery.

36
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,550
Delaminating
the surrounding lymph nodes...

37
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,319
is also a crucial procedure.

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,719
- Suction.
- Suction.

39
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,590
I said I want my leg back.

40
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,930
Where did you put it?

41
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,729
- I want my leg!
- The stench of ammonia.

42
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,770
Darn it, let go of me.
Leave me alone!

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,099
Auditory and visual hallucinations.

44
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,599
I'll kill you!

45
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,409
Don't look at me.

46
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,370
I'll kill you.

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,039
He suffers from paranoia too.

48
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,810
Once the layers are peeled off
the duodenum and peritoneum,

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,219
the specimen
will have gathered in one place.

50
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,889
Doctor.

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
There's bleeding
from the incision of the pancreas.

52
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,860
Bipolar forceps, please.

53
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,060
Thankfully, it's not
massive bleeding.

54
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,100
His BP is dropping.

55
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,009
92 over 60, Doctor.
His pulse rate is 98bpm.

56
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,050
- We need blood.
- Of course.

57
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,620
What's Dr. Park doing?

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,120
Does he know what went wrong?

59
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,230
Dr. Park, is something wrong?
Dr. Park?

60
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Dr. Park!

61
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,389
Excuse me.

62
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
Doctor?

63
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,569
I'm sorry, but could I borrow
your pen and notepad?

64
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,500
Sure, here you go.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
Thank you.

66
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,240
Are you a fast runner?

67
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,279
Pardon?

68
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,879
Can you please take this to the OR?

69
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,319
As fast as you can.

70
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,639
You darn jerks. Get away from me.

71
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,110
What are you doing?

72
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,310
Who told you
that you could take a photo of me?

73
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,949
Stop taking photos of me, you jerk!

74
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,149
- Let me go, you punk.
- Sir.

75
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,259
Sir, please calm down.
What's your name?

76
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,660
What are you doing at my house?

77
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,730
Get out, you jerks! Get out!

78
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
He has mental confusion.

79
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,699
(Confusion: A state of being unclear
in the mind)

80
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,930
An overactive
sympathetic nervous system.

81
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,500
Symptoms of acute jaundice.

82
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,240
And an enlarged liver?

83
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,439
Get off me!

84
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,350
Get over here, you jerk!

85
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:48,810
Darn it!

86
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,480
- Are you okay?
- Can you please make a call?

87
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,990
Hurry up and call the police!

88
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,819
No, don't call the police.

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,790
Call 911. You need to call 911.

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,800
The patient's pulse keeps dropping.

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,600
This could lead to cardiac arrest.

92
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,339
Doctor, someone wanted you
to see this.

93
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,920
(Surgery in progress)

94
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,129
Ms. Choi.

95
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,160
Check his left lung
with your stethoscope.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,569
I hear decreased breath sounds.

97
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,209
His PIP is also rising.

98
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,610
I think there's a blockage.

99
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,709
- Take out the gas.
- Yes, sir. I'll take it out.

100
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,579
Ask for a portable x-ray.

101
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:55,579
We don't have time for that.

102
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,009
Give me a catheter.

103
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,339
What a relief.

104
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,850
Excuse me. Please make way.

105
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,949
Tension pneumothorax
was something we did not expect.

106
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,120
But fortunately, we detected it
very quickly and dealt with it.

107
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,490
Now, we'll need to do
a laparotomy...

108
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,019
to find the cause of the problem.

109
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,289
(Laparotomy: A surgical procedure
involving a large incision)

110
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,259
However, we haven't prepared
for a laparotomy.

111
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,600
So unfortunately, we will now
have to end the demonstration.

112
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,909
Did you bring the memo?

113
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,320
Hello, sir.

114
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm Cha Eun Jae,
a fellow at Geodae Hospital

115
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,149
How did you know that it was
a tension pneumothorax?

116
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,820
Was it really pneumothorax?

117
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,029
Did the patient live?

118
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,090
No.

119
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,460
I asked you how you knew.

120
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,799
Well, it wasn't me
who figured it out.

121
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,570
May I ask you...

122
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,299
who you are, sir?

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,580
By any chance, have you heard
of Doldam Hospital?

124
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,809
I work there.

125
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,179
I'm Master Kim.

126
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,710
(Tension pneumothorax)

127
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:20,159
Who? Who did you say
is looking for me?

128
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,230
He told me that you'll know...

129
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,029
if I tell you
that Master Kim is here.

130
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,500
I can't see him. I'm busy.

131
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,970
I already tried telling him that.

132
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,370
Yes, I'm sure he's busy.

133
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,039
It's okay. I'll wait.

134
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,210
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

135
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,070
Tell him I didn't even get to eat...

136
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,440
because I've been attending
meetings since this morning.

137
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,509
My goodness,
he didn't even get to eat?

138
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,549
I really don't mind waiting,
so tell him he can take his time...

139
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,649
and that he should call me
after he's done with his meetings.

140
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,289
Tell him I'll be waiting here
all day.

141
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,590
Tell him that the meeting will
end really late.

142
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,759
It's okay.
Don't worry about me at all.

143
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,830
I'll just wait here.

144
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,230
My gosh, he's so annoying.

145
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,100
Who does he think
he's trying to fool?

146
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,539
What do you think
you're doing, you jerk?

147
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,580
You can't just
bring him here like this.

148
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,379
If you got in a fight,
you should've gone to the police.

149
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,350
Stop cussing.

150
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,220
Let me go, you jerk!

151
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,419
I'm sorry, but there's not much
we can do...

152
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,830
for someone who's drunk.

153
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,559
All we can do is give him
an IV injection until he wakes up.

154
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,129
But as you can see,
the beds are packed...

155
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,460
with other urgent patients.

156
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,870
He shows severe signs
of anxiety, hallucination,

157
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,929
and an overactive
sympathetic nervous system.

158
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,799
It looks like he has
delirium tremens.

159
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,370
Are you a doctor or what?

160
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,409
Yes, I work in general surgery.

161
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,139
"General surgery"?

162
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,210
(General surgeon, Seo Woo Jin,
Geosan University Hospital)

163
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,019
- Oh, I see.
- Get off me!

164
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,179
He also has jaundice,

165
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,289
so it looks like he might have
epilepsy due to alcohol.

166
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,759
Take him for a liver function test
and sonography.

167
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,789
Okay, sir.

168
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,990
How long have you worked here?

169
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm a fourth-year resident, sir.

170
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,759
Give him some benzodiazepine
before he has a seizure.

171
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,799
(Benzodiazepine: A type of sedative,
Seizure: A sudden attack of illness)

172
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,830
Let me go, you punk!

173
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,830
- Hey, give him 4ml of lorazepam.
- Let me go!

174
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,799
Hey, who is he?

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,110
I've never seen him before.

176
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
He's the new pay doctor
who came last week.

177
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,840
He's Dr. Seo Woo Jin.

178
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,740
Don't you know
what happened recently...

179
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,850
at Samjin Hospital?

180
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,779
Coming through!

181
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,090
He's a 65-year-old male.

182
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,220
- Tell me his vitals.
- 200 over 110. 117bpm.

183
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,259
He's been having severe chest pains
for about an hour.

184
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,830
And now, he says
his back hurts as well.

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,090
- His back also hurts?
- Yes.

186
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,929
Sir, how do you feel?

187
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,529
Do you have stabbing pains
in the back?

188
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,029
Doctor, he's having a seizure!

189
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,600
Please check his vitals.

190
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,769
Over here!

191
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,539
Let me go!

192
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,639
Please get out of the way!

193
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,139
He got into a fight and collapsed.

194
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,309
Now, he has stomach pains
and can't even stand up.

195
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,409
Let me check.

196
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,879
Does it hurt even more
when I press on your stomach?

197
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,149
- Take him to that bed over there.
- Okay.

198
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,820
- My goodness.
- Dr. Yun, hurry!

199
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,389
Let me go, you jerk!

200
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,590
Dr. Yun, what should we do with him?

201
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,289
Can you please help us over here?

202
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,100
Get off me!

203
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,960
Can you please call Dr. Lee?
Tell him it's urgent.

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,169
Let me go!

205
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,240
Why won't you believe me?
I'm serious.

206
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,840
He wrote "pneumothorax",
I started running,

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,850
and the patient lived.

208
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,009
Thanks to that, Dr. Park managed
to overcome a crisis.

209
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,250
He's extremely charismatic
in real life.

210
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,090
He has an unusual kind of aura.

211
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,759
I can't believe he figured out
that it was a pneumothorax...

212
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,360
just by watching the screen.

213
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,129
I'm serious.

214
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,529
The patient's BP was dropping.

215
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,529
Dr. Park didn't know what to do.

216
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,000
He almost lost his patient
in front of 100 people.

217
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,470
But thanks to his note that said
it's tension pneumothorax...

218
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,509
Hey, what are you doing?
That was my money.

219
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,090
Long time no see, Eun Jae.
Have you been well?

220
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,960
Mom, I'll call you back.

221
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,159
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,759
Didn't you hear the news?

223
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,500
No, I didn't.

224
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,500
I started working here
ever since last week.

225
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,100
I thought you went to work
with Hyun Joon.

226
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,909
You left saying you're
going to earn millions.

227
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,110
So why are you here?

228
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,570
You really haven't heard anything?

229
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,039
No, I haven't.

230
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,509
You should listen
to what people say.

231
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,860
Didn't you know?

232
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,929
He became an outcast
for whistleblowing.

233
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,000
"Whistleblowing"? Woo Jin did that?

234
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,129
Yes.

235
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,129
Hyun Joon must've done
some dirty stuff...

236
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,029
while running the hospital.

237
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,840
He received dirty money
from a medical equipment company,

238
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,639
did some unnecessary surgeries,

239
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,679
and even asked other doctors
to do his surgery for him.

240
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,879
(Traitor, Hypocrite, Rest in peace)

241
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,480
Woo Jin must've reported that
to the upper management.

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,850
(You psycho)

243
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,350
I think Professor Kim is going
to say it was you.

244
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,419
What? It wasn't me.

245
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,960
After that incident, every doctor
including his friends...

246
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,360
started to turn their backs on him.

247
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,470
They even signed a petition.
It was a complete mess.

248
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,539
They called him a scumbag
for betraying his own colleague.

249
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,539
I think no hospital
wanted to take him after that.

250
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,940
Then how did he come back here?

251
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,850
The center head brought him...

252
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,850
to work weekends and nights.

253
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,450
General Surgery is so short-staffed.

254
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,350
I see.

255
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,220
Are you two still a bit like that?

256
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:55,960
Like what?

257
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,600
You two were famous
in medical school.

258
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Whenever you made eye contact...

259
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,970
Don't stare.

260
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,740
Shut up!

261
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,269
Who will answer?

262
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,309
You two again?

263
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,080
Anyone else?

264
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,779
Who'll go to the conference?

265
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,250
- Move.
- You move.

266
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,450
Will you back down?

267
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,620
I'll kill you!

268
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,860
Let's see my surgery schedule.

269
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,840
(Hemorrhoidectomy, Seo Woo Jin)

270
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,039
All five of them are hemorrhoids?

271
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,809
Yes. That's the schedule
we have so far.

272
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,980
What? Are you not interested?

273
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,580
Then back out.

274
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,590
It's not like your absence
will halt the whole OR.

275
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,120
No, I'm good with hemorrhoids.

276
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,200
You got here late again?

277
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,559
Yes. Something came up.

278
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,400
There was a rumor that
you worked as a gigolo.

279
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,410
You still do it?

280
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,309
But then, pouring a drink
is way easier than operating.

281
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,150
If you put your heart into it,
you could make more money too.

282
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,549
Do you suddenly want a drink?

283
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:29,849
What?

284
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,660
Shall I find you
a cheap but nice bar?

285
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,759
If you want, I could
pour the drink myself.

286
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,930
You're a real nasty one.

287
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,869
Why are you so shameless
after what you did?

288
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,529
I might not have done right,

289
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,799
but I don't think
I did anything wrong either.

290
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
Because of you,

291
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,140
Hyun Joon closed his hospital...

292
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,710
and might become homeless.

293
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,410
His house was seized...

294
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,279
and his wife's demanding a divorce.

295
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,049
You ruined your senior's life...

296
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,049
and what?

297
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,589
You don't think
you did anything wrong?

298
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,549
Are you kidding me?

299
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,460
Call me whenever
you need a discount.

300
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,759
What is wrong with him?

301
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,579
Are you sure that you gave him
4ml of lorazepam?

302
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,819
Yes, just like you ordered.

303
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,450
Doctor.

304
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,450
Patient three's BP is 210 over 110.

305
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,619
- What? Did you call CS?
- Yes, a while ago.

306
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,660
Call again. Say
there's an urgent case.

307
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,730
Okay.

308
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,599
Doctor, my friend's in pain.

309
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,829
Won't you look at him?

310
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,559
Just a moment. Sorry.

311
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,000
No Dr. Lee yet?

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,500
It's my third time calling
and he won't answer.

313
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,740
This is crazy.

314
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,339
If your boss won't answer,

315
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,480
call the guy above him!

316
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,609
Who are you?

317
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,549
(Doldam Hospital)

318
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,650
Fourth-year, give the DT patient...

319
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,650
4ml more lorazepam.

320
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,259
Order an EGK and echocardiogram
for the guy with chest pains.

321
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,559
And Patient Five needs sonography.

322
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,559
Who is that guy?

323
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,730
Dr. Ahn, get the FAST, quick.

324
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,099
(FAST: Focused Assessment
with Sonography for Trauma)

325
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,200
Hey, fourth-year.

326
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't just stand there. Move.

327
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,009
Lorazepam!

328
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,339
Okay.

329
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,279
Sir, I need you
in the ER right away.

330
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,250
Yes. It's an emergency.

331
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:48,690
Are you going to the ER?

332
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,029
Some lunatic...

333
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,329
is causing trouble in the ER.

334
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,039
- A lunatic?
- This guy called Boo Yong Joo.

335
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,400
He showed off,

336
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,240
acting like a genius,
then got kicked out.

337
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,539
Where's the patient?

338
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,039
He's getting a CT scan.

339
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,150
Wasn't it a dissection?

340
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,849
He came in with chest pains,

341
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,849
but the EGK showed nothing
but a T-wave inversion.

342
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,720
The sonography
showed no wall motion,

343
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,950
but there was a free flap
in the descending aorta.

344
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,420
No flap in the ascending,

345
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,990
but the aorta was enlarged.

346
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,990
- BP?
- Initially was 210 over 110,

347
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,329
Esmolol lowered it to 150 over 80.

348
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,559
Esmolol?

349
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,200
I was going to prescribe labetalol.

350
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,769
But...

351
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,309
I'll be gentle.

352
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,640
It's okay.

353
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
That hurt?

354
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,079
I'll be gentle.

355
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,819
What are you doing in my ER?

356
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,960
It's a negative on the FAST.

357
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,089
It may look fine on the sonography,

358
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,730
but the patient's in poor shape.

359
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,200
I think his bowel's perforated.

360
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,730
Call GS immediately.

361
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,200
Step aside right now.

362
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,470
30 minutes?

363
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,299
My gosh.

364
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,769
You got here quickly.

365
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,039
Three emergencies
rolled in together...

366
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,710
and no one showed up.

367
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,420
I thought everyone was off
taking an urgent poop.

368
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,390
You're breaking
Medical Treatment Laws.

369
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,190
How dare a branch doctor
treat here without permission?

370
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,130
I didn't treat anyone.

371
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,200
I just helped get things sorted.

372
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
What?

373
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,299
What else should I have done?

374
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,930
A fourth-year resident...

375
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,970
and two interns were holding
down the fort on their own.

376
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,109
Should a senior doctor
have just sat and watched?

377
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,609
Where the heck is Lee Myung Han?

378
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,009
I'm right here.

379
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,519
Lee Myung Han, where were you
when you should've been here?

380
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,579
I apologize.

381
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,250
My lunch didn't agree with me.

382
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,619
I was right.

383
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,730
He did go for an urgent poop.

384
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,829
Il Joong.

385
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,859
Stay focused.

386
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,230
There's a DT, a dissection,
and a perforated bowel.

387
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,440
Three emergencies came in at once,

388
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,269
but the fellow who's in charge...

389
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,940
was too busy pooping
to show his face.

390
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,279
Hey. Then you should've come down
to manage things.

391
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,349
Does this situation even make sense?

392
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,190
You're so frustrating.

393
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,190
So frustrating.

394
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,960
(Emergency Ward)

395
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,730
- Fourth-year.
- Yes?

396
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,630
You did well today.

397
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,000
Thank you. Goodbye.

398
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,190
Master Kim.

399
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,519
Hello.

400
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,789
I'm second-year
CS fellow Cha Eun Jae.

401
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,690
I'm the person...

402
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,700
from the live surgery
who took your note and ran.

403
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,460
The runner.

404
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
So what?

405
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,740
There's something I want to ask you.

406
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
What?

407
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:23,109
How did you find out that it was
the pneumothorax?

408
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,279
The operating surgeon had no idea,

409
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,349
but you noticed it
from watching the screen.

410
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,750
What logic helped you
reach that conclusion?

411
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,750
I'd really like to know.

412
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,690
Weren't you called to the ER?

413
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,059
I just came from the ER.

414
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,490
- You heard of the dissection?
- I did.

415
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,890
Then you must've heard...

416
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,859
the aortic dissection is
in the ascending aorta?

417
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,029
Yes.

418
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,700
Then you must know
the patient needs urgent surgery.

419
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,240
Should you be here?

420
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,470
I heard the patient's
getting a CT scan.

421
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,480
Then you must prepare
for what's next.

422
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,809
Call Anaesthesiology, book an OR,
and prep for surgery.

423
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,450
Logic, my foot.

424
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,420
You couldn't even
do your job properly,

425
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:13,220
but here you are
shooting poop out of your mouth.

426
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,869
What? Shooting poop
out of my mouth?

427
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,339
Isn't that oil?

428
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,440
Get up!

429
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,309
The bus might catch fire! Hurry!

430
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,190
The bus might catch fire!
Hurry! Get out of there!

431
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,170
- Come on. Get out right now!
- Hurry!

432
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,349
(Episode 1: Rainmaker)

433
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,769
It's perfect!

434
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,460
It's been a while.

435
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,799
It's you, right?
The one from Doldam Hospital.

436
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,829
Yes, I'm Jang Gi Tae,
the manager of Doldam Hospital.

437
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,400
It's been a while, sir.

438
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,470
- Good to see you.
- Right.

439
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,710
Is everything well at Doldam?

440
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,220
Of course, sir. Thanks to
the support from the foundation,

441
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,019
we have been able to upgrade...

442
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,349
our surgical tools
as well as our ICU.

443
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,519
I hear that
all your young surgeons left.

444
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,630
It's not like they wanted to.

445
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,390
Certain issues came up for them.

446
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,359
The whole world already knows...

447
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,299
how ill-tempered Boo Yong Joo is.

448
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,369
- Sorry?
- He belittles others...

449
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,069
and puts himself on a pedestal.

450
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,069
No young doctors
would voluntarily work with him.

451
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Don't you agree?

452
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,339
Goodness, sir.
That's not what happened at all.

453
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,579
Dr. Kang Dong Joo
was called to serve the country...

454
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,910
at a clinic on an island.

455
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,920
Dr. Yoon Seo Jung went to San Diego
on a two-year exchange program.

456
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,490
And as you know, Dr. Do In Beom
is back at Geodae Hospital.

457
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,960
Anyway, they have all left.

458
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,000
It's supposed to be a trauma center,

459
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,900
but there are no decent attendings.

460
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,500
How can a hospital
even operate properly?

461
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,910
As you know,
Master Kim has the skill of 100 men.

462
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,970
Thanks to him, we're still managing.

463
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,680
I see.

464
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,859
Mr. Jang, you're here.

465
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,970
You clean up nicely.
Check out that shirt.

466
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,140
I went the extra mile.

467
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,240
Where's Master Kim?
Isn't he with you?

468
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,710
He went to Seoul
to talk business at Geodae Hospital.

469
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,039
Why? Did something happen?

470
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,140
It sure did.

471
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
Do you know...

472
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,809
who I encountered in the restroom?

473
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,880
Who did you run into?

474
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,819
That man over there.

475
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,630
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

476
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,299
Mr. Do, welcome.

477
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,380
Did you have to come here
and make me uncomfortable?

478
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,140
I can say the same to you.

479
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,410
Why are you avoiding me
like the plague?

480
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,680
When did I avoid you?

481
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,690
Seriously?

482
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,059
Look at the time.
We were supposed to meet at 10am.

483
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,119
It's already three in the afternoon.

484
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,259
Uncross your legs.

485
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm the center head.

486
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,730
Do you even know how busy the center
head at the headquarters is?

487
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,339
How can you cause this mess just
because I pushed back our meeting?

488
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,140
Dr. Lee is still fuming.

489
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,349
It's always the incompetent ones
that get riled up.

490
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,380
Seriously though.

491
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,549
Keep yourself in check.

492
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:52,589
You're at Geodae University Medical
Center, not Doldam Hospital.

493
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,730
Anyway, what about
that favor I called in?

494
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
What favor?

495
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,759
I've been telling you
from a month ago...

496
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,799
to send me a general surgeon.

497
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,339
We don't have anyone to spare.

498
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,140
Even we don't have enough
general surgeons.

499
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,809
- Are you sure there's no one?
- There's none.

500
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,250
No doctor wants to work
in the countryside...

501
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,019
and none will be able
to handle you as a boss.

502
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,750
You know how kids are these days.

503
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,220
Your old-fashioned antics
will be plastered online...

504
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,960
and you'll be doxed.

505
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,589
Seriously though.
There's no one you can spare?

506
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,160
How about this instead?

507
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,930
Pack everything up
and come to Seoul.

508
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,470
I'll open up a position
for you here.

509
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,500
Doldam Hospital is hopeless now.

510
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,640
All your young doctors left,

511
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,369
and you-know-who
is the new foundation chair.

512
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,380
What are you talking about?
A new foundation chair?

513
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,849
Don't you know
who's occupying the seat now?

514
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,650
Thank you all for coming.

515
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:01,920
Three years after...

516
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,559
resigning as the president
of Geodae Medical Center,

517
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,099
we meet again.

518
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,930
Due to many misunderstandings,

519
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,539
I had to step away
from the medical field.

520
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,710
However, thanks to
the loyal support of the board,

521
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,079
I was able to be appointed
as the foundation chair.

522
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,809
The foundation chair?

523
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,089
I will follow in
my predecessor's footsteps...

524
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,650
and do my best
to make the foundation proud.

525
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,720
I look forward to
your ongoing support.

526
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,230
Thank you.

527
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,200
Chairman Do, congratulations.

528
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,930
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

529
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,480
Do Yun Wan. He's back...

530
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,180
as the foundation chair.

531
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:59,579
He just wrapped up
his inauguration speech...

532
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,049
and the board
couldn't be more thrilled.

533
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,450
How did it go in Seoul then?

534
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,319
Did you find a decent doctor?

535
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,789
By all means necessary this time,

536
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,990
you must bring home
a general surgeon.

537
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,769
You know what I mean, right?

538
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,430
Master Kim?

539
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,700
Master Kim?

540
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,750
(Chairman Shin Myung Ho)

541
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,990
President Do won't give up.

542
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,490
His tenacity is not something
to take lightly.

543
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm afraid...

544
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,900
you can't get rid of me that easily.

545
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,769
That's how the world is.

546
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:55,740
Justice? Corruption?

547
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,740
People run out on the street
lighting up candles...

548
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,309
in order to save the world,

549
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,380
but that never lasts.

550
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,079
If life gets tough,

551
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,519
they'll turn their backs on you
and curse your existence.

552
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,219
That's the true nature of people.

553
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,489
You think they're all on your side.

554
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,900
Don't be a fool. This world...

555
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,760
and the people in it...

556
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,829
never change that easily.

557
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:27,940
Soon, I'll be back.

558
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,769
Just you wait and see.

559
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,219
Doctor, you can't let this slide.

560
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,980
He's defaming our reputation.

561
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,289
This isn't the first time
Woo Jin has caused trouble.

562
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,559
What do you mean?
I don't think I understand.

563
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,699
Our doctors must be competent,

564
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,860
but they should also have dignity.

565
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,670
Did I do anything
to suggest otherwise?

566
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,300
I hear you've been working
a salacious part-time job.

567
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,940
You said it yourself, remember?

568
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,440
You pour drinks
and get tipped for it.

569
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,510
You even offered to introduce
a fine place with beautiful ladies.

570
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,650
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

571
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,190
I'd rather not drag this out.

572
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,019
Find another place to work.

573
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:20,960
You only hired me...

574
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,389
because you were understaffed.

575
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,429
Operations are backed up
but you don't have enough surgeons.

576
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,869
You feigned generosity...

577
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,599
and wanted to put me on duty...

578
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,400
so you could have me do
all the dirty work.

579
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,070
Isn't that why you hired me?

580
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,039
Then just make me do the work...

581
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,139
instead of using my lack of dignity
as an excuse.

582
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,780
That might've been why
the center head hired you.

583
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,179
But not me.

584
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,650
You have no dignity as a doctor.

585
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,389
You don't care at all
about hierarchy.

586
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,320
You have no sense of loyalty.

587
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:56,289
You're just a cheap jerk
who only cares about money.

588
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,590
You go against my principles.

589
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,699
Are you doing this...

590
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,030
because of my previous
whistleblowing incident?

591
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,739
Pack your stuff and leave today.

592
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,769
I'll report it to the center head.

593
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:15,239
You'd better leave after you're done
taking care of the patient...

594
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,309
that just got taken to the OR.

595
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:38,170
What? Shooting poop
out of my mouth?

596
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,670
We never met before.

597
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,690
(Alprazolam)

598
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,300
What?

599
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,400
You're first today?

600
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,570
Yes, professor.

601
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,139
- No other options?
- No.

602
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,969
I'm on duty tonight.

603
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,210
Keep your wits about you.

604
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,070
If you doze off
during surgery again,

605
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,679
I'll ban you from my OR
for life, okay?

606
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,750
Yes, sir.

607
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:57,480
Let's begin. Scalpel.

608
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,420
Left hemicolectomy.

609
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,820
Through the colostomy?

610
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,460
No, end-to-end.

611
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,889
- Very well.
- Bovie.

612
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,530
Right angle.

613
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Suture.

614
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Cut.

615
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,829
We got all the vessels
but there's still bleeding.

616
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,869
The diaphragm's torn.

617
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,869
Dr. Shim.

618
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,039
I'll combine with CS
for the diaphragm injury.

619
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,610
Why not patch it up yourself?

620
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,309
You'll only delay the procedure.

621
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,420
It's bleeding.

622
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,480
Call the CS doctor on duty.

623
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,429
Cha Eun Jae. You...

624
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,030
Are you dozing off again?

625
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,429
No, sir.

626
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,210
Blow.

627
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,510
Stay awake.

628
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,119
OR 6 is asking for Dr. Cha.

629
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,119
- On speaker.
- Speak up.

630
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,349
I'm GS fellow Seo Woo Jin.

631
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,789
A 48-year-old male
is in surgery for...

632
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,730
a large bowel rupture
due to an abdomen blunt injury.

633
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:53,000
I just discovered a diaphragm tear.

634
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,630
Can we combine right now?

635
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,670
- Vitals.
- He's stable.

636
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,199
The CT only showed a rib fracture.

637
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,500
Hold.

638
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,909
Cha Eun Jae. You go.

639
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,840
- What?
- Stop the bleeding and clean up.

640
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,449
I'll finish up here.

641
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,079
Get going.

642
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,519
Okay.

643
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,889
This is insane.

644
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,650
(Alprazolam)

645
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,070
Did GS decide
not to touch diaphragms now?

646
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,469
It's bleeding.

647
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,349
It ruptured when the trauma
increased pressure in the abdomen.

648
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,250
Can't GS repair something like this?

649
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,619
It's best if CS
were to do it properly.

650
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,289
For the patient's sake.

651
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,230
- Needle.
- Scissors.

652
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:42,469
Cut.

653
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,840
Cut.

654
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,360
What's wrong?

655
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,260
What do you mean?

656
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,230
Cut.

657
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,199
Cut.

658
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,380
Will you hold properly?
It's shaking.

659
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,449
Blood.

660
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,889
Suction.

661
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,800
It's not helping.

662
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,670
- Gauze.
- Gauze, give me gauze.

663
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:54,940
Oh, no.

664
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,650
It's okay, it's not a re-bleeding.

665
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,309
It was a pooled clot.

666
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,389
I'm sorry, but I...

667
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,659
I need to go...

668
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:11,989
Doctor.

669
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,429
Cha Eun Jae!

670
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,050
Seriously?

671
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,059
You will now begin
your training in dissection.

672
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,760
First, for those
who donated their cadavers...

673
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,869
for the growth and development
of the medical field,

674
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,840
we will show our respects.

675
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,250
At ease.

676
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,449
You will start by
removing the sheet.

677
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,389
Attention.

678
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:23,170
What you learned in class
will be put to the test today.

679
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,599
First, you will examine
the muscles in the leg.

680
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,840
Split into groups of three
and take a leg each.

681
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,210
The incision will be made...

682
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,480
along the inguinal ligament.

683
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:37,550
Make a lateral incision
above the knee,

684
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,250
then a vertical one down the middle,

685
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,719
and spread the muscles like a book.

686
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,420
If you need help,
please follow the TA in Group Two.

687
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,829
All right. Let's begin.

688
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,070
Sorry.

689
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,039
- What?
- Eun Jae, are you all right?

690
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,710
Eun Jae!

691
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:41,079
Eun Jae? Eun Jae!

692
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,789
Are you all right?

693
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,679
Goodness.

694
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,320
We're way past summer,
so who knew that...

695
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,090
it could pour like this in the fall?

696
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,090
Are you looking for a hospital
to work at?

697
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,929
Do I know you?

698
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,010
Have you heard of Doldam Hospital?

699
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,039
It's a small hospital in Jeongseon,

700
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,010
and I hear it's looking
for a surgeon in GS.

701
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:58,880
Are you interested?

702
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,980
Do you know me?

703
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:03,250
Just that...

704
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,550
you're a pay doctor...

705
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,590
who was just let go
from Geodae Medical Center.

706
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,429
Do you know why?

707
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,199
All that I know...

708
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,260
is that you're an outcast...

709
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,199
who's being ostracized
for being a whistle-blower.

710
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:23,840
And still you're offering me a job?

711
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,480
- Why?
- Why not?

712
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,949
I need a surgeon in GS...

713
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,949
due to all the backed-up surgery.

714
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:36,949
I'm feigning generosity
by offering you a job...

715
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:40,320
just so I can dump
all the unpleasant surgeries on you.

716
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:41,920
That's why.

717
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:46,190
If you're interested,
come by the hospital.

718
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,769
(Doldam Hospital, Master Kim)

719
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,739
Gosh, I wonder
when it'll stop raining.

720
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,269
It's freezing.

721
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,969
Are you awake?
It's about time you got up.

722
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,119
Professor.

723
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,559
You see,

724
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,489
I haven't been able to sleep...

725
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:53,030
due to all the reading
and the rounds at the ICU.

726
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,059
(Alprazolam)

727
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:57,530
How long have you been taking this?

728
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,670
I haven't, professor.

729
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,070
All I take is a calming pill.

730
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,170
Eun Jae.

731
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,070
Do you seriously want
to lose your license?

732
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,849
I'm sorry, sir.

733
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,380
I only wanted to suppress my nausea.

734
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,550
What do you mean?

735
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,320
Being in the operation room...

736
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,360
brings on hyperventilation
and nausea.

737
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:27,360
I only took them
to steady my heart-rate.

738
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,400
I'm sorry, sir.

739
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,139
Do you even hear yourself?

740
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,300
A surgeon in cardiac surgery
can't control her nerves...

741
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,409
and has to take pills to calm down?

742
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,969
It's the first time I took these.

743
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,840
Please believe me, professor.

744
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,179
This is why I don't hire girls.

745
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,690
What? Why are you looking at me?

746
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,119
My issues in the OR...

747
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,260
is a personal one that only I have.

748
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,690
It has nothing to do
with me being a woman.

749
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,530
So? Are you saying
you did nothing wrong?

750
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:06,099
No, professor. I'm sorry.

751
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:09,969
There are two options
in which I can punish you.

752
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,110
Either be suspended...

753
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,210
No, sir. Please don't.

754
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,010
You can't suspend me, sir.

755
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,010
Then work off your suspension
at our branch hospital.

756
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,010
Sorry?

757
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,150
Our branch hospital?
Which one is that?

758
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,920
Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.

759
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:26,619
Doldam?

760
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:28,789
Doldam Hospital?

761
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,989
You can't even do
your job properly...

762
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,659
but here you are
shooting poop out of your mouth.

763
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,829
Professor, is there an Option C?

764
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,699
I'll accept a pay cut instead.

765
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:43,409
I'll even work the night shifts
during the holidays.

766
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,570
How's that?

767
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,139
No can do.

768
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:48,139
You have only two options.

769
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:49,380
Be suspended...

770
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,050
or work at Doldam Hospital.

771
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,280
The choice is yours.

772
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,449
Oh, no.

773
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,489

from the ward all morning.

No.

Ms. Oh, what's up?

792
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,559

supposed to end last week.

Look at you enjoying your time...

00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,030
reading a darn book
with earplugs in your ears.

What's the matter with you?

It's fall. The season of romance.

Ms. Oh, why are you
so sensitive today?

801
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,440
Why hasn't the construction
ended yet...

802
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,150
when it was supposed to end
last week?

What if all the nurses
get migraines and fall ill?

Will you at least file it
as an industrial accident?

If you have a problem,
don't come complaining to me.

Why should I talk to him?

He always stopped
the construction work...

saying it was getting in the way
of the treatments and surgeries.

811

The construction got delayed...

812
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,599
because he always
complained about it.

813
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,969
Stop trying to blame it on him.

814

there were some difficulties.

00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,380
The hospital is a wreck.

819
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,349
There's construction work
going on all the time.

820
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,690
And the manager...

821
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,590
slacks off all the time.

822
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,860
Ms. Oh.

823
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,190
I'm not slacking off.
I'm just enjoying romance.

824
00:55:58,429 --> 00:55:59,489
My gosh.

825
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,599
Do Yun Wan came back
as the chairman.

826
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,670
So don't start talking to me
about romance.

827
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:09,070
Ms. Oh, we're expecting
two patients...

828
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,440
with car accident injuries
in five minutes.

829
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,909
We have a patient coming,
so I need to go now.

830
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,039
Daddy will call you back,
sweetheart.

831
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,119
Hey, Mr. Jang.

832
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,079
Can you keep this for me?

833
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,619
Don't eat it.

834
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,230
(General Surgery, Family Medicine)

835
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,630
Ms. Oh, let's go.

836
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,869
Dr. Bae! Dr. Bae!

837
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:46,980
Mun Jung?

838
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,079
Dr. Bae, give me that before you go.

839
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,349
What?

840
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,480
Oh, right. Here you go.

841
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,460
Please finish the construction
as fast as you can.

842
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,360
How long did everyone take?

843
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,489
- 2 minutes and 45 seconds.
- Okay.

844
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,829
Excuse me. May I help you?

845
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,940
How are their conditions?

846
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,079
They both got injured
in a car accident.

847
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,510
One person has
a nearly-amputated left leg.

848
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,510
And the other person was stuck
in the steering wheel.

849
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,380
He has abdominal pain
and seems to be in shock.

850
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,590
Dr. Bae and Mr. Park, you guys
can handle the amputation.

851
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,820
Dr. Jung and Ms. Oh,
you can come with me...

852
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,760
to treat the patient
with abdominal pain.

853
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,889
- Okay?
- Okay.

854
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:36,929
Okay.

855
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:48,170
This patient was in a car accident!

856
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,469
His left leg is nearly amputated
from the knee down.

857
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:52,710
His BP is 100 over 70,
and his pulse rate is 130bpm.

858
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,380
There were a lot of bloodstains
when we got there.

859
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,539
So I'm guessing
he lost a lot of blood.

860
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,610
Take him to number two.

861
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,579
We have another one.

862
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,880
He was the driver and was found
stuck in the steering wheel.

863
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,250
He says he has
severe abdominal pain.

864
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,920
- His BP is 80 over 40.
- Number two.

865
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,090
They were both stuck in the car.

866
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,650
So it took about 40 minutes
to rescue them.

867
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,960
- Bring him over here.
- Excuse me.

868
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,130
Get ready.

869
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,800
- Get me some saline.
- Sir, can you tell me your name?

870
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,260
Let's do a CBC
and an operation laboratory test...

871
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,469
for blood type ABO.

872
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,599
Please check both lines
as you sample the blood.

873
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,670
We'll carry out an ABGA
and a FAST at the same time.

874
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,710
We're also going to conduct
an ABGA and a FAST.

875
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,869
- We also need sonography.
- Yes, Dr. Jung.

876
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,739
- Dr. Jung, let's open this.
- Yes, sir.

877
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,539
That's so cool.

878
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,710
Dr. Yun?

879
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,309
Dr. Cha, I'm surprised
to see you here.

880
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,079
What are you doing here?

881
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:09,880
I heard Doldam Hospital is
looking to hire young doctors.

882
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,960
Don't tell me you're here to apply.

883
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,590
Yes, I'm here to apply.

884
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,989
By the way, didn't he come with you?

885
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,599
Who?

886
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,460
You know that guy who caused trouble
at Samjin Hospital.

887
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,099
Dr. Seo Woo Jin.

888
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:28,900
Seo Woo Jin?

889
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:31,809
- My gosh, what are you doing?
- Let me clean this up for you.

890
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:32,809
Oh, okay.

891
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,949
Take that item.

892
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,079
Here. That one.

893
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,519
Take that item.

894
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:44,519
You suck at this game, don't you?

895
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,349
My gosh.

896
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:04,039
Woo Jin, did you think
we wouldn't be able to find you...

897
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,539
if you went into hiding?
Look at me.

898
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,010
What's wrong with your cell phone?

899
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,809
Why don't you answer our calls?
It's very upsetting.

900
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,380
You owe us so much money, you punk.

901
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:18,320
Does it hurt?

902
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:21,460
Does it hurt?
It hurts me to hurt you.

903
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,800
Get up.

904
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:34,739
Does it hurt?

905
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,510
What are you doing?
Get up, you punk.

906
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:42,309
What did you just say?

907
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:44,949
Let's not waste our energy, sir.

908
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,780
Let's just take one of his kidneys
and put an end to this.

909
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,050
Get him up.

910
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:52,989
Woo Jin, come on.

911
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,190
Let's go, Woo Jin.

912
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,360
Hey!

913
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,429
- Hey, stop!
- Hey!

914
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,340
Stop right there!

915
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,519
- Hey!
- You punk!

916
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,730
- Cut.
- Cut.

917
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:43,670
- Cut.
- Cut.

918
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,119
It's awfully quiet today.

919
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:01,090
Yes, they finished the construction
an hour ago.

920
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,989
Does that mean we'll be
able to do surgery...

921
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,929
in a cutting edge OR
starting from tomorrow?

922
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:08,099
Yes, probably.

923
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,369
- Cut.
- Cut.

924
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,400
Okay, we're all done.

925
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:17,369
Dr. Bae, you can
take care of the rest.

926
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,710
Okay, sir.

927
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:21,039
Good work, everyone.

928
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,389
He looks exhausted.

929
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,059
I'm not surprised.

930
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,929
He's been covering for three doctors
for two months after they left.

931
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,230
He did a total of 18 surgeries
this week...

932
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,030
for both GS and CS.

933
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,869
- Cut.
- Cut.

934
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:19,070
How nice.

935
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:26,469
No news from the general surgeon
we're expecting today?

936
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,139
Not yet.

937
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:29,679
She will come, right?

938
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,150
I don't know. I hope so.

939
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:34,050
- Cut.
- Cut.

940
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:49,699
(Doldam Hospital)

941
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,750
The surgery is taking
longer than expected.

942
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,420
Will you drink as you wait?

943
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,989
No, thank you.

944
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:15,760
Thank you very much.

945
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:20,190
Call the Administrative Office
whenever you need something.

946
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,670
Aren't you hungry?

947
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,969
On the way here,

948
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:32,369
I saw a 24-hour ox head
hangover soup place.

949
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:34,280
Shall we eat after the interview?

950
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,380
No. I don't like meat in water.

951
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:39,150
I see.

952
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:45,650
Hello, Master Kim.

953
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,460
Hello...

954
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,980
You asked if I need a job.

955
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,119
The thing is,

956
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,260
I need money.

957
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:30,260
How much can you give me?

958
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:32,900
You need money,

959
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:36,300
so you'll go into the OR for that?

960
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:40,170
That's how it sounds like.
Am I right?

961
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,280
Yes.

962
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,320
If I offer a good price,

963
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,050
you'll sell yourself for anything?

964
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:53,690
If need be.

965
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:55,989
How much will you pay?

966
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,360
(Dr. Romantic 2)

967
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,099
Who's here?

968
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,230
It's the Minister!

969
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,070
- What are his vitals?
- Saturation?

970
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,300
There's no time. Find a pulse.

971
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,440
I'd like to recommend him as his
attending doctor. What do you say?

972
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,780
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

973
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,179
You still don't know...

974
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:53,780
who brought you here, do you?

975
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,119
If it's to save him,

976
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,980
can I do just anything?

977
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,449
We must save him.

978
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,119
The success rate is very low.

979
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,719
- BP is dropping.
