1
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:56,829
What's wrong?

2
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,700
This is excruciating.

3
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,399
Are you still dizzy?

4
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,530
I mean, the humiliation.

5
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,400
What do I do now?

6
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,870
Just like a broken record,

7
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,569
that scene keeps playing in my head.

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,310
Vomiting, fainting,
being carried on your back.

9
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,879
That plays over and over again.

10
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,310
Stop thinking about it
and forget everything.

11
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,780
How can I?

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,180
I displayed
the three main signs of weakness...

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,390
one could show
in the dissection lab.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,120
The sophisticated image I had
was thrown out the window.

15
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,489
Unbelievable.

16
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,760
Can I share a trick with you?

17
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,030
What trick?

18
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,599
A way to reset and clear
your screaming mind.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,239
And what's that?

20
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,239
This.

21
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,579
What was that?

22
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,049
Didn't it work?

23
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,519
It didn't.

24
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,859
Really?

25
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,319
Really.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,020
How's that?

27
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,919
Your head's clearer now, right?

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,629
You...

29
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,860
jerk.

30
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,409
What was that?

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,439
I asked you what that was.

32
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,280
Do you really not know
or are you trying to confirm it?

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,580
Stop messing with me. It's no fun.

34
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,580
This is why I told you
not to get serious with me.

35
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,849
Because once you do,

36
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,819
things will get boring and pathetic.

37
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,849
- Woo Jin.
- So...

38
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,030
don't be heartbroken
over someone else's business.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,159
It's confusing.

40
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,710
("I couldn't manage the debt
that was piling up...")

41
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,949
Come in.

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,330
Why haven't you gone home yet?

43
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,759
I should. I will soon.

44
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,930
Did you stop by my office today?

45
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,430
Oh, right.

46
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,439
The budget cut explanation
by Medical Evaluation Committee.

47
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,209
I left the file on your desk.

48
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,740
Was there anything else?

49
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,209
No, not really, sir.

50
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,110
I see.

51
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,019
Have a good day then.

52
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,889
Go ahead and answer.

53
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,029
Sure.

54
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:58,639
Hello?

55
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes, it's me. Did you look into it?

56
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,579
You sent an email?

57
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,939

- Master Kim.
- Yes?

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
What's the matter? Did you get hurt?

65
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,790
No, I'm fine.

66
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,189
It's nothing.

training at Doldom Hospital
for a month.

73
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,579
Let's welcome the sophomores
of Geosan College of Nursing.

74
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,050
Welcome.

75
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,550
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Oh Myung Sim, the head nurse.

76
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,949
- Hello, ma'am. We'll do our best.
- Hello, ma'am. We'll do our best.

77
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,220
Did you guys practice
how to say hello?

78
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,389
You guys have great teamwork.

79
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,259
Our hospital receives
a lot of trauma patients.

80
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,959
You should try to experience
as much as you can.

81
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,300
It'll help you in the future
once you start working.

82
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,370
Ms. Uhm Hyun Jung
and Ms. Joo Young Mi...

83
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,730
will be in charge of you guys.

84
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,639
- We'll do our best.
- We'll do our best.

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,939
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

86
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,370
I'm going to pair you up
and divide you into four teams.

87
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,980
The ER. The ICU.

88
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,410
The general ward,
and the office for outpatients.

89
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,149
The ER team can stay here.

90
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,720
As for the others, please follow me.

91
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,790
They must be nursing trainees.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,259
Oh, yes.

93
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,959
Students from the College of Nursing
come to train at this time of year.

94
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, I see.

95
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,199
We don't have any patients yet.

96
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,529
So take a look around the ER
and get used to everything.

97
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,800
The bed numbers and stuff.

98
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,470
Make sure you don't get in the way
of the doctors. Understood?

99
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,769
- Yes, Ms. Joo.
- Yes, Ms. Joo.

100
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,209
Just a second.

101
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,680
(Doctor's Office)

102
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,789
What's going on?

103
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,720
I gave one of the empty offices...

104
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,559
to Dr. Shim Hye Jin.

105
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,730
And we'll be sharing
the remaining office together.

106
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,230
Is there a problem with that?

107
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,500
No.

108
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,340
Dr. Seo is a GS surgeon,
so I get why he's here.

109
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
But what about me?

110
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,870
Why do I need to work here?
I'm a CS doctor.

111
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,110
You told me
you're going to put up a fight.

112
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,009
So I'm giving you
a chance to do that.

113
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,080
You can go ahead
and try to fight this.

114
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,220
You can quit if you have a problem.

115
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,590
No, I'll stay.

116
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,429
Can someone get me a cup of coffee?

117
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,870
I'd like a cup of Americano.

118
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,070
Make sure you only add...

119
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,710
two spoons of sugar.

120
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,940
I'll go.

121
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,690
Do you know what
Dr. Park hates the most?

122
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,389
- Pardon?
- He hates it when fellow doctors...

123
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:46,960
date each other.

124
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,230
What do you mean?

125
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,529
What do you think?
I'm saying you should be careful.

(Hybrid Room)

127
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,289
- Dr. Yun.
- Yes, Mr. Park?

128
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,429
What?

129
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:23,590
I mean, Ms. Uhm.

130
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,360
What do you need, Ms. Uhm?

131
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,700
We just got an asthma patient.

132
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,600
- Bed three.
- Oh, really?

133
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,570
Okay, I'll go and take a look.

134
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,009
Would you like this?

135
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,750
Really? It's for me?

136
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,980
Thank you for this.

137
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,519
- Thank you.
- Sure.

138
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,649
Ms. Uhm is unbelievable.

139
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,460
She's so slow-witted.

140
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,899
What are you doing, Dr. Yun?
Bed three.

141
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,629
Oh, right. I'll be right there.

142
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,480
Oh, my goodness!

143
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,759
I almost got a heart attack, Ms. Oh.

144
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,889
Did something good happen?

145
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,830
It's just a great day today.

146
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,529
It's a good morning
and a new day.

147
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,470
Do you study
how to speak English these days?

148
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,169
The sun goes down early,
and the nights are long.

149
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,470
I have no one
to soothe my loneliness.

150
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,009
There's nothing much to do
to spend the long nights.

151
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,210
So I enrolled myself in an English
speaking class downtown.

152
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,779
Then...

153
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,490
what's up with all that stuff?

154
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,559
What? What are you talking about?

155
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,620
The president's office.

156
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,889
I prepared this just for you, sir.

157
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,700
I got the coffee machine
you asked for.

158
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,600
I also got you the desk
and furniture you wanted.

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,500
- And...
- What's that?

160
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,340
This is just a small gift
I got for you.

161
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,509
Now that you're
working at Doldam Hospital,

162
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,179
you'll be facing a lot of
stressful situations from now on.

163
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,049
And I thought you could
get some good rest.

164
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,480
Okay, you may leave now.

165
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,850
Pardon?

166
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,860
Oh, okay. I'll be off.

167
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,190
Do you have no backbone?

168
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,129
Or do you just not learn?

169
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,500
Dr. Song took advantage of you
three years ago,

170
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,830
and you're still
repeating the same mistake?

171
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,830
He's on a whole different level.

172
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,429
He was just the head
of surgery department.

173
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,000
But this time,
it's the hospital president.

174
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,200
So what?

175
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,210
You want to get on his good side...

176
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,679
so you can have a successful career?

177
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,409
I'm not doing this for myself.

178
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,549
This is all just groundwork
for Doldam Hospital.

179
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,049
Groundwork, my foot.
I'm not interested.

180
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,889
You can't just keep ignoring him.

181
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,590
You might end up being the only one
falling behind, Ms. Oh.

182
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,590
I'd rather take things slow...

183
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,960
than be a cheeky opportunist.

184
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,289
I'll just keep my own pace...

185
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,500
and stay at peace with myself.

186
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,769
Do you know...

187
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,940
who managed to get...

188
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,570
a five percent raise
in both our wage and extra pay?

189
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,710
Yes, it was me.

190
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,879
It was my work.

191
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,980
President Park is
in the palm of my hands.

192
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,419
Trust me, Ms. Oh.

193
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,490
Yes, President Park.

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,629
My gosh, people really don't change.

195
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,899
Yes, right now?

196
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,370
My phone is out of battery.

197
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,149
This time, it's not my...

198
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,299
My gosh, this is suffocating.

199
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
- Finish up.
- Okay.

200
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,970
- And check Bed three.
- Okay, I'll do that.

201
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm so tired today.

202
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,039
Did you not sleep last night?

203
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,480
Ms. Oh, why are you here?
You aren't coming upstairs?

204
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
Where to?

205
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,590
I was paged to attend
the weekly meeting.

206
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,789
You weren't?

207
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,460
I'll ask Manager Jang. You go ahead.

208
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,570
Okay.

209
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,570
This is the Administrative Office.

210
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,480
Hello, Ms. Oh.

211
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,679
Manager Jang?

212
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,080
He left to attend
the weekly meeting.

213
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,179
What's the matter?

214
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,320
Oh, did he?

215
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,149
No, it's fine.

216
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,049
I'll call his phone.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,169
(Oh Myung Sim)

218
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,809
I apologize for being a little late.

219
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,210
It's fine. Take a seat.

220
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,009
Dr. Seo, sit over here.

221
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,149
Here's the coffee you asked for.

222
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,820
(President Park Min Guk)

223
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,590
Okay. Thanks.

224
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,059
You can give me the 50 cents later.

225
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,460
You made him get your coffee
without paying him first?

226
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,359
It's not like that.

227
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,730
The CS surgeons
still want to keep...

228
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,630
their juniors in line.

229
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,940
Us ER doctors...

230
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,269
haven't asked for a coffee
in a long time.

231
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,740
Isn't it wrong these days to use
your authority in that way?

232
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,710
I said it's not like that.

233
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,109
Okay, then.

234
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,220
I think everyone's here.

235
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,990
Shall we begin the meeting?

236
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,319
Where's the Head of Surgery?

237
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,900
Oh. I dropped by his office
before coming here.

238
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,859
Master Kim?

239
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,599
Master Kim?

240
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,900
He's not at work yet?

241
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,910
No. This has never happened before.

242
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,910
He hasn't called and
I don't know what's going on.

243
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,750
Let's start the meeting.

244
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,519
Pardon me, but the head nurse
isn't here yet either.

245
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,789
Oh, that's...

246
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,819
From now on, the weekly meeting will
be attended by these members only.

247
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,359
- Pardon?
- The weekly meeting...

248
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,359
will happen without the head nurse?

249
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,059
Anything she needs to know,

250
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,970
Manager Jang will inform her.

251
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,809
(Oh Myung Sim)

252
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,420
What about Dr. Cha?
Why isn't she here?

253
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,519
She'll transfer to
another hospital soon.

254
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,750
She will?

255
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,650
Where to?

256
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,259
What for?

257
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:40,920
Things happened.

258
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,190
That's all you need to know.

259
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,000
Just like that?

260
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,130
(Business Plan)

261
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,569
That's the new business plan.

262
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,970
Doldam Hospital...

263
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,410
will go through a radical reform.

264
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,650
First, we'll drastically reduce
emergency trauma surgeries.

265
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,680
What?

266
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,250
Emergency trauma
and injuries are our specialty.

267
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,519
If you cut down on that...

268
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,890
We'll switch the system
to focus on...

269
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,890
outpatients and general surgeries.

270
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
There are no such patients.

271
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,829
Starting tomorrow, patients
scheduled for surgeries...

272
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,559
at Geodae will be sent here.

273
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,529
Dr. Yang, schedule the treatments...

274
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,069
to the patients' convenience.

275
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,299
Yes, sir.

276
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,269
Running a hospital...

277
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,140
solely based on estimates
will work no longer.

278
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,410
Once the system is somewhat stable,

279
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,740
I plan to enforce...

280
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,079
a performance-based evaluation
system for each department.

281
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,549
Keep that in mind and work hard.

282
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,099
It looks like this patient has AGE.

283
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,329
Set up an IV line...

284
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,799
so that he can be hydrated.

285
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,769
As soon as Dr. Jung
returns from the meeting,

286
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,339
I'll have him confirm
the lab results.

287
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,569
Yes, doctor.

288
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,480
Will you step back?

289
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,539
- Okay.
- Okay.

290
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,680
Have any of you
set up an IV line before?

291
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,880
I know what to do in theory,
but I've never done it.

292
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,490
Forget about theory. Can you do it?

293
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,549
This is my first hands-on training.

294
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,119
But I'll give it a go.

295
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,190
Forget it. You'll just
torture the patient.

296
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,640
The trainees seem to be very tense.

297
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,980
It's their first day.
They should be.

298
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,309
On my first day as an intern,

299
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,349
I fumbled around so much.

300
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:50,150
I knew nothing,
couldn't do anything,

301
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,660
and no one told me anything.

302
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,660
I wish one of my seniors
had given me some kind pointers.

303
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,500
Dr. Yun.

304
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,369
I worked nights two days in a row.

305
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,039
We're short-staffed
and patients keep coming in.

306
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,069
I don't have the energy
to teach the trainees too.

307
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,910
I'd rather use that energy
to care for another patient.

308
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,079
I know what you mean. But still...

309
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,910
I know what you're trying to say.

310
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,450
I'd rather you don't mind.

311
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,920
Let us deal with our problems, okay?

312
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,670
Ms. Oh, can we have a word?

313
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,740
What? I'm moving
to another hospital?

314
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,940
Who said that? Dr. Yang?

315
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,480
Yes, in the meeting
with the president present,

316
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
he made the announcement.

317
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,490
Gosh. He really
stabs one in the back.

318
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,559
He told me to fight
and he changed his mind?

319
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,119
What's wrong? Why are you
on his bad side?

320
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,660
It's a terribly long and sad story.

321
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,430
It'll take a bottle of soju and
five dried fish to get through it.

322
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,130
He got you bad.

323
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,069
What did Master Kim say?

324
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:16,809
He didn't believe
what Dr. Yang said, did he?

325
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm not sure if it's
good luck or bad,

326
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,309
but he wasn't there.

327
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,509
He wasn't there?

328
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,480
- He wasn't there?
- No.

329
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,849
Manager Jang said
he's not at work yet.

330
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,950
I tried twice. He won't answer.

331
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,619
What's going on?

332
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,059
He's never done this before.

333
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,829
The call cannot be connected.

334
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
By the way...

335
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,259
Since when did his arm hurt?

336
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,759
It seemed pretty bad.

337
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,900
Oh, his wrist?

338
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,000
He was hurt three years ago.

339
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,369
When he operates
too much or is tired,

340
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,569
he struggles a bit.

341
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,670
His wrist?

342
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,809
But what I saw yesterday...

343
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,890
(Name: Master Kim)

344
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,230

00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,420
Dr. Seo?

353
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,490
There's something
I'd like to say in private.

354
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,660
To me?

355
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,329
What's it about?

356
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,569
It's about Master Kim.

He's not picking up.

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,069
Where on earth is he
that he's not answering?

364
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,049
Myung Sim, where are you going?

365
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:37,380
Wait. Ms. Oh.

366
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,920
Ms. Oh, wait. Ms...

367
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,160
There you are.

368
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,759
I was coming to see you.

369
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,259
Talk to me, Ms. Oh.

370
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,089
Is this the reason...

371
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,029
why you left me out of
the weekly meeting?

372
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,500
You'll cut down emergency trauma
care and temporarily shut it down?

373
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,640
Those numerous trauma patients.

374
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,539
Where are they supposed to go?

375
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,910
That's nothing
a head nurse should worry about.

376
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,980
Every week,

377
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,319
an average of 30 to 40 patients
come to this hospital...

378
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,890
with light or severe injuries.

379
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,519
Over half of them come here
fighting for their lives.

380
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,859
Are you suggesting
that we let them die?

381
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,890
Why would they die...

382
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,029
when government-funded
trauma centers...

383
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,960
have been established
all across the country?

384
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,799
The closest one from here
is an hour and 50 minutes away.

385
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,599
Are you aware that with traffic,
it could take patients...

386
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,740
2 to 3 hours to get there?

387
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,680
Then are you aware of...

388
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,650
the loss this hospital suffered
in the past three years?

389
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,950
At this rate, the hospital
may have to close within months.

390
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,990
Did you know that?

391
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,859
I'm here trying
to save this hospital,

392
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,460
so where's the gratitude?

393
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,799
How dare you try to patronize me
with sob stories?

394
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,829
President Park!

395
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,599
Dr. Nam, please.

396
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,400
You should just close
the hospital then.

397
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,910
Ms. Oh, how can you say that?

398
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,670
During the golden hour,

399
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,410
this is where patients come to...

400
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,049
with their last sense of hope.

401
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,450
Because we're in the red
and they don't bring in money,

402
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,150
we're supposed to abandon them?

403
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,589
If that's the case, why bother
restructuring the system at all?

404
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,019
Just close the darn hospital.

405
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,630
- Ms. Oh!
- If doctors...

406
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,390
and hospitals...

407
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,559
care more about profit
than patient care,

408
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,400
then it's over anyway.

409
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,039
Closing the hospital
is the right thing to do.

410
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,420
President Park...

411
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,119
Darn.

412
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,589
President Park!

413
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,460
The head nurse sure is fierce.

414
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,369
Seniority and hierarchy
don't seem to exist.

415
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,170
I can't believe she scolded
the hospital president like that.

416
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,940
That's how it is at Doldam.

417
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,069
We don't care about
seniority or hierarchy.

418
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:19,880
But...

419
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,210
we have respect for each other.

420
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,480
On top of that, you have
a silly sense of romanticism.

421
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,049
How are you all
going to survive this?

422
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,819
Every part of the world
believes that money conquers all.

423
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,190
Respect and humanity...

424
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,859
can even be sold off for a price.

425
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,559
So shouldn't there...

426
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,400
at least be one place
that doesn't follow the trend?

427
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,200
And this is that place?

428
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,430
If it weren't,

429
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,569
we wouldn't bother
to stay at Doldam.

430
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:50,839
Ms. Oh?

431
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,049
(Doldam Hospital)

432
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,559
Ms. Oh has always been passionate
when it comes to our patients.

434
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,700
Are you saying that we don't care...

435
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,470
about patients like she does?

436
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,730
That's not what I meant.

437
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,599
Manager Jang, wisely choose a lane.

438
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,039
Having one foot on either side...

439
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,539
won't win you a popularity award.

440
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,140
Who are you trying to play?

441
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,599
You're not even
going to acknowledge me?

442
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,869
- What?
- You were at the meeting,

443
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,940
so you heard that I'll leave here.

444
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,069
So? Will you let it happen?

445
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,740
No. Why would I?

446
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,609
Sticking it out
is the trend these days.

447
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,380
I'll stick it out...

448
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,750
and get smart with the others
until I'm asked back at Geodae.

449
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,880
Good.

450
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,269
What are you looking for?
What is it?

451
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
(Carpal tunnel, ulnar tunnel,
and trigger finger)

452
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,710
You, there. Dr. Seo?

453
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,539
Do you not hear me?

454
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,880
Are you keep going
to ignore me like this?

455
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,650
What if I don't?

456
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,549
Shall we carry on
with what we did yesterday?

457
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,160
What the...

458
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,690
Your one and only
same-year colleague...

459
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,359
has been framed and stabbed
in the back by a senior doctor...

460
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,359
and is now being threatened
into leaving this hospital...

461
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,599
Why are you stammering?

462
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:59,470
- When did I stammer?
- That's how you were...

463
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,539
just now.

464
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,910
I'm furious, that's why.

465
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,910
Ho Jun's being a complete jerk.

466
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,779
Still, how can you
call yourself a friend...

467
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,450
and just brush it off...

468
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,750
when I'm obviously in trouble?

469
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,619
You're just cool with it?

470
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,789
Okay, I get what you mean.

471
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,819
Know what? I didn't say anything.

472
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,859
I'm nothing but a colleague
who entered the hospital...

473
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,259
in the same year as you,

474
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,930
so I shouldn't cross that line.

475
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,700
I understand you loud and clear.

476
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,569
Why are you always like that?

477
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm trying to
smoothly let you know...

478
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,940
that I'm cool
with your mistake yesterday...

479
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,140
It wasn't a mistake.

480
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,410
Things could get awkward,
so I'm trying hard...

481
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,779
not to let it come to that.

482
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,079
I don't feel awkward at all.

483
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,420
Anyway, can't you see
that I'm trying my best?

484
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,589
Don't try then.

485
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,900
Like I said, I get what you mean.

486
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,279
Why are you looking up
carpal tunnel syndrome?

487
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,450
Does your wrist hurt?

488
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,579
Not me.

489
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,650
Is it a patient then?

490
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,380
If it were, it'd be OS' problem.

491
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,750
Then who is it...

492
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,720
if it's not you or a patient?

493
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,359
Who is it?

494
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Master Kim.

495
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,230
Master Kim?

496
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,980
What?

497
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,420
CTS? Master Kim?

498
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,250
Yes, that's what I heard.

499
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,220
Dr. Bae, how long have you known?

500
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,690
Not long.

501
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,359
Right before
Dr. Seo and Dr. Cha joined,

502
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,859
he came to me with a stiff wrist
and I checked it.

503
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,660
What caused it?

504
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,500
He injured his wrist
three years ago,

505
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,099
and he's been putting
too much stress on it ever since.

506
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,339
It should've been operated on,

507
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:15,910
but he had to set it aside
to care for our patients.

508
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,009
Ms. Oh and Dr. Nam
don't know about it yet, right?

509
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,039
No.

510
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,880
Master Kim said he'd tell them
when he books his surgery.

511
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,109
He and I haven't told anyone yet.

512
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,980
Can CTS patients...

513
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,089
experience pain or numbness...

514
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,390
in their elbows?

515
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,160
Not with CTS patients.

516
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,220
Master Kim came to me last week...

517
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,259
because his wrist
wouldn't bend backward.

518
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,200
I took an MRI to see if he had
a herniated cervical disc,

519
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,299
but nothing showed up.

520
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,900
Oh, I see.

521
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,069
Hold on.
You asked me that earlier too.

522
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,339
Why the interest in that?

523
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:50,809
Is there something bothering you?

524
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,640
Is that what it is?

525
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:54,640
What is it?

526
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,279
No, nothing's for certain yet.

527
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:08,859
Here.

528
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:14,059
It's the list of Dr. Park's VIP
patients who will come tomorrow...

529
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,200
and their illnesses.

530
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,670
I want you to make a schedule...

531
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,740
based on the numbers I wrote down
beside their names.

532
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:22,140
And we're expecting four residents
from the main hospital.

533
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:23,940
I want you to take care of them.

534
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:27,579
Make sure they eat dinner,
and take them to their dorms.

535
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,809
Dr. Park carefully chose them
himself...

536
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,519
based on how well they performed
in the OR.

537
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,450
Dr. Park is in charge
of all these patients?

538
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,150
I can take over
some of the simple ones.

539
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,160
By the way,

540
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,029
remember when the loan shark
caused a scene at the hospital?

541
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,170
You'd better make sure
that never happens again.

542
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,170
If that happens again...

543
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,170
while Dr. Park's patients
are hospitalized here,

544
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,839
you'd better expect
to get fired too.

545
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,389
Do you think he heard us?

546
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:13,820
If he did, he would've asked
about it right away.

547
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,659
Let's make sure
they don't find out...

548
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,559
about Master Kim's wrist.

549
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,429
A CTS isn't a big deal.

550
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,599
He'll recover
three weeks after his surgery.

551
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,699
But still, let's keep
our mouths shut, okay?

552
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,869
Okay.

553
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,070
Let's keep it a secret for now.

554
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,539
Okay?

555
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,079
Okay.

556
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,510
Okay.

557
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Let's drink.

558
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,230
Cheers.

559
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,559
Cheers!

560
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,699
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

561
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:03,639
I sincerely congratulate you
on your return, Chairman Do.

562
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,579
Don't lie to me.

563
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,579
I'm sure you were comfortable
while I was gone.

564
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,719
That's absurd.

565
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,349
You have no idea
how much I waited...

566
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:17,789
for you to return, sir.

567
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,320
Then why didn't you visit me sooner?

568
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,329
Pardon?

569
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,860
My goodness, forgive me, sir.

570
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,500
I wanted to come see you
on the day you got inaugurated.

571
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,469
But I was appointed...

572
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,309
as the center head
even though I lack so much.

573
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,039
Anyway, please forgive me.

574
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,480
Let me pour you a glass.

575
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,679
I will assist you wholeheartedly
and stay loyal to you.

576
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,250
Cheers to Chairman Do!

577
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,519
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

578
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,489
By the way,

579
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,800
how is Dr. Park doing?

580
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,199
He's actually giving me a headache.

581
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,440
Gosh, I'm not even surprised.

582
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,110
I don't get why he volunteered to be
the president at Doldam Hospital.

583
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,239
By the way,

584
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:18,579
when are you going to announce
the construction of Mirae Hospital?

585
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,079
Because of what you told me,

586
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,820
I already told my wife
to buy some land there.

587
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,719
But I haven't gotten
any updates ever since.

588
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,389
The realtors already heard the news,

589
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:33,800
so the land there is already worth
30 percent more than before.

590
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,530
You've already earned
that much money.

591
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,599
I didn't invest my money
just to earn 30 percent more.

592
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,409
You of all people should know that.

593
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,010
I guess you're right.

594
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:51,079
Anyway, you should push ahead
with the new business.

595
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,380
We have high hopes for you.

596
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,150
Of course.

597
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,860
You all did your best
to help me return.

598
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,289
So it's only right
that I pay you back.

599
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,699
Don't worry.
I'll proceed with it pretty soon.

600
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,360
If Mr. Song was in charge,

601
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,769
he would've gotten rid
of Doldam Hospital...

602
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,769
and started
the construction work already.

603
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,840
Pardon?

604
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,869
Me?

605
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:19,610
- What do you say?
- Pardon?

606
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,110
Would you like to be in charge?
Are you interested?

607
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,719
My goodness, there's no need to ask.

608
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,719
I'll do anything you ask.

609
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,320
Dr. Park can be a little inflexible.

610
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,760
You know what I mean. He's smart,

611
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,260
but he's too unrealistic.

612
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,230
I've worked with him
a few times at the main hospital.

613
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,599
He can be really frustrating.

614
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,699
And he's unbelievably stubborn.

615
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,139
You have a guest.

616
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,840
I'm sorry I'm late.

617
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,420
My goodness, President Park.

618
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,260
Welcome.

619
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:08,559
Come on.

620
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,360
You're not late at all.

621
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,849
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Let's just take a cab.

622
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,820
Didn't you hear?
It's 40 minutes away by car.

623
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,849
Let's just take the bus.

624
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,449
Hey, Do Il.

625
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,260
Where were you all day?

626
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,659
You didn't even answer my calls.

627
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,289
I was busy.

628
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,159
I'm about to take the city bus.

629
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,030
I'll be there
in about 30 to 40 minutes.

630
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,599
The city bus?
Where are you right now?

631
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,340
I'll talk to you once I'm there.

632
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:57,869
- Oh, gosh.
- My goodness.

633
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,079
You can go first.

634
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,409
- Thank you.
- No problem.

635
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,210
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

636
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,519
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

637
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,619
Does this go to Doldam Hospital?

638
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:12,789
Yes, this bus will
take you to the hospital.

639
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,219
See? I told you so.

640
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

641
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,260
Did you talk to Master Kim?

642
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,400
He just answered his phone.

643
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
- Where was he?
- He won't tell me.

644
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,840
He'll be here soon.
Let's wait until he arrives.

645
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,760
You traitor.

646
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:55,500
You have no backbone,
and you're so easy to control.

647
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:03,070
What? What's your problem?

648
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,309
You're the traitor, not me.

649
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,820
You're unbelievably brazen,
Manager Jang.

650
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,690
How dare you call me a traitor?

651
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,320
Do you only care about the patients?
What about us?

652
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,630
Don't you care at all about
the people who work with you...

653
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,929
at this hospital?

654
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,500
What are you talking about?
When did I ever say that?

655
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,829
Then how could you...

656
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,469
tell the president to shut down
the hospital so easily?

657
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,969
They're trying to change...

658
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,070
everything about this hospital.

659
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,469
Was I supposed to stay still?

660
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,610
Okay, fine.

661
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,079
Let's say Doldam Hospital
shuts down.

662
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,079
Master Kim, Dr. Nam, and you...

663
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,980
could always get another job
at another hospital.

664
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,050
Hospitals are
always short on the medical staff.

665
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,650
You'll probably get
loads of job offers.

666
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,820
But what about us?

667
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,389
What about me, the people
at the Administrative Office,

668
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,730
and the cleaning staff?

669
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,699
There are over 20 employees
who aren't doctors or nurses...

670
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,269
here at Doldam Hospital.

671
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,570
On top of that, most of them...

672
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,599
are breadwinners.

673
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,469
What's going to happen to them
if the hospital shuts down?

674
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:15,480
We don't have full-time jobs
like you do.

675
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,650
And it's very hard for us
to get jobs.

676
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,050
Do you want all of us
to become jobless?

677
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,150
You're overreacting, Manager Jang.

678
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,590
Ms. Oh doesn't actually want
the hospital to shut down.

679
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,789
I would love...

680
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,130
to live like you and Dr. Nam.

681
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,500
A graceful life where you care about
the greater good...

682
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,969
and speak out about your beliefs
to keep your pride and ego.

683
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,469
I also want to live
a marvelous life like you two.

684
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,769
But as for myself...

685
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,670
No, as for the rest of us,

686
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,980
we can't live like that.
Do you know why?

687
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,679
Because we're easily replaceable.

688
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,179
It doesn't have to be me.
Anyone else...

689
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,750
can come along and replace me.

690
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,760
So even if you tell me
I have no backbone,

691
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,329
all I can do is smile.

692
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,230
And I have no choice but to succumb
even though you call me a traitor.

693
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,170
I need to survive.

694
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,739
I need to make a living and survive.

695
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,039
So, Ms. Oh.

696
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,949
Don't say...

697
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,250
we should shut down the hospital
so easily.

698
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,289
Manger Jang. Sir, wait.

699
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,389
He's being too sensitive.

700
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,530
He knows you didn't mean it.

701
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,909
- Water. Give me water.
- Oh, okay.

702
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,739
Here you go.

703
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:03,849
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Give me a moment.

704
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,989
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

705
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,989
Sit down.

706
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,829
What do you think...

707
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,300
I just said to her?

708
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,739
Pardon?

709
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,769
I'm such a fool.

710
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,150
My heart is about to explode.

711
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,150
How could I yell at her?

712
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,730
So, Ms. Oh.

713
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,030
Don't say...

714
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,400
we should shut down the hospital
so easily.

715
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,699
Ms. Uhm.

716
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,440
It's snowing outside.

717
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,710
It's snowing?

718
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,949
- It's snowing.
- It is.

719
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,489
It's so pretty.

720
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,920
- How about a photo?
- Good idea.

721
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:52,929
(Doldam Hospital)

722
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,530
It's snowing.

723
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:06,179
I'd love to have some hot
ramyeon soup and soju right now.

724
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,739
I'd love to have a hot bath...

725
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,809
followed by a good night's sleep.

726
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,750
I wish there were
no traffic accidents.

727
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:15,949
You go ahead.

728
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,920
I think I should sleep here tonight.

729
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,519
Oh. Don't drink any alcohol.

730
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,519
We might have an emergency.

731
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,530
Okay?

732
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,340
The weather forecast
was right for once.

733
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,170
It said it was likely to snow.

734
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,340
I brought an umbrella.

735
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,440
Yes, honey.

736
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,909
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,980
I stayed to talk to Mom
and left late. Sorry.

738
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,119
Did Hyung Sik eat dinner?

739
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,420
Good for him.

740
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,659
It just started to snow.

741
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:56,889
Should we keep him at home tomorrow?

742
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,429
I know.

743
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,300
Okay.

744
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,530
- How about a snow fight?
- We could go skiing too.

745
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,670
- We really could.
- We should.

746
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,380
What's that?

747
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:17,809
Oh, no!

748
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,619
Help me.

749
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,909
Carpal tunnel syndrome?

750
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,440
Yes.

751
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,179
Master Kim's wrist
must be acting up.

752
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,880
That's why he wasn't here today.

753
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,280
He needs urgent surgery,

754
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,989
and once he gets it,
he can't work for 3 or 4 weeks.

755
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,019
Okay.

756
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,159
Yes.

757
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
Yes.

758
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Yes.

759
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,300
Yes, sir.

760
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:47,400
I'll figure out the schedule...

761
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,900
and keep you updated.

762
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,210
Bye.

763
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,820
Give me a break, okay?

764
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:11,289
Why are you out here?

765
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,400
Everyone's having a great time.

766
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,460
I have to get back to the hospital.

767
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,500
To work.

768
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,599
Why are you working so hard?

769
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,139
Just coast along and slack off.

770
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,340
Let your minions do as much as
you can get away with.

771
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,980
If the president works too hard,
it stresses out the staff.

772
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,579
If I were to go back in now,

773
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,579
it would only ruin the mood.

774
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,280
Please put in a good word for me.

775
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,349
A human being...

776
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,389
must know how to go with the flow.

777
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,630
We know which way
the tides are turning,

778
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:46,329
so don't waste your energy.

779
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:49,260
Are you eyeing my position?

780
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,199
Listen, President Park.

781
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,710
I'm not that ambitious.

782
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,710
My motto is to lie low and go far.

783
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,340
I'd rather last long...

784
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,880
and follow the mainstream,
not the outsiders.

785
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,179
And...

786
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,820
I don't even want to burp in
Doldam Hospital's direction.

787
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,150
So please.

788
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,460
Don't get me involved in your plans.

789
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:16,889
Just do as the chairman says, okay.

790
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,130
I'll get going.

791
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:23,969
Bow when you think you must.

792
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,769
Or nothing will work out.

793
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,840
He's so stiff.

794
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,210
Where did he get to?

795
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,079
Why did I even come here today?

796
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,780
Where are you?

797
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,750
Have another drink.

798
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,750
I'm here!

799
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,579
I'm back.

800
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,579
I know.

801
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,750
It's going just fine.

802
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,429
Park Min Guk.

803
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:59,269
What on earth is he thinking now?

804
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,860
(Doldam Hospital)

805
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,900
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

806
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,170
Master Kim?

807
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:14,179
What?

808
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,039
Why did you all come back?

809
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,050
We can't let you
be cool on your own.

810
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,920
She said it's disloyal to let you
stand by all on your own,

811
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,519
and dragged me in by the scruff.

812
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,989
You didn't have to be so loyal.

813
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:29,690
Here, it's customary...

814
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,389
to stay at the hospital
if it rains or snows.

815
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,000
Everyone does that?

816
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Most of the time. Unless
they have other pressing issues.

817
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,030
Who made that rule?

818
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,269
Master Kim?

819
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:42,440
He was the first to do so.

820
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,110
And we followed suit.

821
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,239
No way.

822
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,710
You work overtime voluntarily?

823
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,780
Hey. Would anyone do this
if they were forced to?

824
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,449
They wouldn't, even for money.

825
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:54,320
It's all about
the work-life balance.

826
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:56,690
Even I prefer to go home
over the extra pay.

827
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,650
See? That's what they say.

828
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,489
Isn't it hard work?

829
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,659
I've been doing it for three years.

830
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,929
I guess it's doable.

831
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:07,059
- You have no grievances?
- Grievances?

832
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:12,769
Other than being apart from
my wife and kid.

833
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,670
To be honest, dealing with patients
can be easier sometimes.

834
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,269
How is that possible?

835
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,610
I wonder.

836
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,480
Staying here...

837
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,780
made it possible.

838
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,150
Since we're all here,

839
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,190
can I order some jokbal,
fried chicken, and makguksu?

840
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,650
Yes. Go ahead.

841
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,789
I'm hungry too. Let's eat first.

842
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:35,159
I'll order then.

843
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,840
This is Seo Woo Jin from GS.

844
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,690
A bus rolled over.

845
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:07,159
Master Kim called me in person.

846
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,429
The bus accident took place
about 10 minutes away...

847
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,389
from Doldam Hospital.

848
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,000
Master Kim...

849
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,769
was also in the bus
when it happened.

850
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,199
What?

851
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,440
What did you just say?
Master Kim was in an accident?

852
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,940
How is he doing right now?

853
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,050
- Is he badly injured?
- Hold on.

854
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,880
Yes, Master Kim.

855
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,179
Everyone is gathered.

856
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:36,849
All right. Hold on.

857
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,989
Everyone, this is Master Kim.

858
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,559
Master Kim, what happened?

859
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,789
A bus rolled over?

860
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,329
Why were you even on that bus?

861
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,099
What's your status?

862
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,469
Who's at the hospital right now?

863
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:55,500
Nearly everyone.
Doctors from EM, GS, CS,

864
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,110
and even the nurses are on standby.

865
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,110
Gosh, thank you so much.

866
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:04,110
Explain the situation there.

867
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,829
Including the bus driver,

868
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,659
I can see about 12 passengers.

869
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:25,300
What should we do?

870
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,099
Woo Jin and Eun Jae.

871
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,340
- Yes, Master Kim.
- I'm here.

872
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,570
You two will head
to the accident site...

873
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,480
as fast as you can.

874
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,849
Don't forget to bring
the emergency health kits.

875
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:40,050
- Yes, Master Kim.
- I'll bring them right over.

876
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:42,050
Get the car keys
and meet met in the parking lot.

877
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,079
Got it.

878
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,139
A pregnant woman nearly at full-term
isn't doing so well.

879
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,510
Please make preparations.

880
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,139
- But there's no OBGYNs...
- Hey!

881
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,949
Let's check with nearby OBGYNs.

882
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,550
Ms. Uhm, please contact
the Department of Gynaecology...

883
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,849
at Jungil Hospital
and Joongan Hospital.

884
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,719
Just as a precaution,
have the NICU ready.

885
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,820
Yes, Ms. Oh.

886
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,989
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes, Master Kim.

887
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:30,369
As of this moment, you are in charge
of Doldam's trauma center.

888
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,139
What? Me?

889
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,400
You can do it, right?

890
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,210
I can do it, sir. Don't worry.

891
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,409
Okay.

892
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,489
As we speak,

893
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,659
I am seeing two passengers
with severe trauma.

894
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,800
Yes, Master Kim.
I will prepare for everything.

895
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:06,099
All right. You heard him.

896
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,139
- Yes.
- Yes.

897
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:09,440
At least 12 patients
will be brought to us soon.

898
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:12,739
Including a pregnant lady, we have
three confirmed trauma patients.

899
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,440
Prepare the beds
nearest to the door...

900
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,739
and fully stock our stations
with warm saline,

901
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,010
elastic bandage, and dressing sets.

902
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,110
Let's move!

903
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,449
- Yes, doctor.
- Yes, doctor.

904
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,280
Also, Dr. Nam...

905
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,949
I know. I'll have the OR ready.

906
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:25,989
Ms. Uhm,

907
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,690
- please contact Ms. Shim.
- Yes, doctor.

908
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,690
Hello, this is Doldam's
emergency room.

909
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:32,929
Master Kim.

910
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:35,630
How are you doing?

911
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,800
Are you injured, Master Kim?

912
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,840
I'm fine...

913
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:49,309
When the ambulances arrive,
I'll manage things at the site...

914
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,179
and get to the hospital
as soon as I can,

915
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:53,619
all right?

916
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:57,519
Yes, Master Kim.
We'll see you at the hospital.

917
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,210
- What's the matter?
- I'm not sure.

918
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:30,889
Gosh.

919
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,219
I think a bus rolled over.

920
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,929
The road is jammed.

921
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,840
I'll get going first.

922
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,199
What?

923
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,610
Hey, Woo Jin. Hey!

924
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,670
Darn it.

925
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:13,630
- I need more dressing sets.
- Yes, Dr. Yun.

926
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,010
Are you all right in there?

927
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,190
Move.

928
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,389
- Over here!
- Get the driver first.

929
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,489
- Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?

930
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,860
Over here!

931
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,929
- Help.
- Together on three.

932
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:53,429
If you can move,
please head toward me.

933
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,070
Let's get you out of here.
Watch your step.

934
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,769
Please be careful. Watch your step.

935
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:00,780
If you can move,
please head toward me.

936
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,010
Watch your step.

937
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,219
Paramedic!

938
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,920
I'm Master Kim of Doldam Hospital.

939
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,920
Bring me some blankets
and a backboard, stat!

940
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:18,130
The pregnant lady
needs to be treated right away.

941
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,860
All right. We'll try to
make a path behind you.

942
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,159
- Okay.
- Bring me a hammer, cutters,

943
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,599
and blankets!

944
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,070
- Please stay back.
- What's going on?

945
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,769
- Sir, you can't be here.
- I'm a doctor.

946
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,469
I'm the president
of Doldam Hospital.

947
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:31,909
Debrief me on the patients.

948
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,840
We just brought the driver up...

949
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,780
and we've begun
rescuing the passengers.

950
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,849
A doctor was inside
the bus that rolled over.

951
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:41,150
He's been running triage
within the bus.

952
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,719
- A doctor?
- Yes.

953
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,090
Yes, it's me.

954
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,489
Dr. Park, a bus
seems to have rolled over...

955
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:53,059
near Doldam Hospital.

956
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,730
I know. I'm at the scene right now.

957
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:00,070
Master Kim was on the bus.

958
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,250
Are you a doctor?

959
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:18,949
Yes.

960
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,659
I'm a doctor.
Please don't worry, ma'am.

961
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,860
Please save my baby.

962
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:28,429
I will.

963
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:30,969
You shouldn't talk.
Please save your energy instead.

964
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,099
But my baby... My baby...

965
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,699
Please, my baby...

966
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,179
Ma'am... Ma'am?

967
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,150
Ma'am, please wake up. Stay with me!

968
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
Master Kim.

969
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,349
This is bad.

970
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,760
Yes, this is Woo Jin.

971
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:03,059
Where are you?

972
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,670
I'm on my way.

973
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,269
Hurry up. Hurry!

974
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,570
Yes, sir.

975
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,460
Her heart stopped!

976
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,969
Where are the cutters?

977
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,000
The pregnant lady
is in cardiac arrest.

978
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:54,480
Dr. Park?

979
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,690
I thought I had escaped.

980
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,269
Dr. Park?

981
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:13,840
I believed...

982
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,809
I had escaped from it entirely.

983
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,119
I'm here, Master Kim.

984
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:59,079
But it turns out...

985
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:05,889
that I haven't
escaped from it at all.

986
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:03,409
(Dr. Romantic 2)

987
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:04,849
If we don't take the baby out,

988
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:05,880
the mother and baby could both die.

989
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,280
We got a call from a rape victim.

990
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:10,320
Dr. Yun, are you inside?

991
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
What do you think I'd prefer?

992
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,420
Dr. Yun!

993
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,420
Lift the bus!

994
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,159
If we move him,
he might have a cardiac arrest!

995
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,559
They're both alive.

996
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,059
And I'm going to save them both!

997
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,329
Do you understand?

998
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:27,030
Master Kim, you're okay, right?

999
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,070
Sponge stick.

1000
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,539
He's even going to do surgery
in that condition?

1001
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:31,539
Master Kim.
