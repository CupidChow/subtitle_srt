1
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,189
I have something to tell you.

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,159
Sure. Go ahead.

3
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,359
I'm afraid...

4
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,670
I'll move to another hospital.

5
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,540
I hear there's a doctor
named Master Kim.

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,120
Unless you want to see him
lose a hand,

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,349
you'll sign the contract.

8
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,920
Ruining the hands...

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,989
of a doctor working
at a rural hospital?

10
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,359
To us,

11
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,000
it's a piece of cake.

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,450
A hospital in Seoul...

13
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,390
is offering twice my salary.

14
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,859
Paying you back
1,000 dollars a month...

15
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,290
has been a pressure.

16
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,489
Upping my salary like this...

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,200
would help me pay off my debt.

18
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,599
That's why...

19
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,599
I made the decision.

20
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,569
You've already made your mind?

21
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,039
Once my patient in the ICU
is out of the woods,

22
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,449
I'll clear my desk.

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,560
Woo Jin.

24
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,500
What is this?

25
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,870
You worried me
by suddenly disappearing,

26
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,340
but then you dropped a bomb
and said you're leaving?

27
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,770
Talk about a random turn of events.

28
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,909
I'm tired and would like to rest.

29
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,780
Shouldn't you at least
explain yourself?

30
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,250
Didn't you hear me just now?

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,349
I've taken another job in Seoul.

32
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,550
Where in Seoul?

33
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,259
Because of Hyun Joon,
no one will hire you.

34
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,930
Hyun Joon...

35
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,530
had other doctors
lift their boycott.

36
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,659
What?

37
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,569
He still can't forgive me
for what I did,

38
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,099
but he doesn't want
to ruin my career.

39
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,639
He sought out his colleagues
and had them draw up contracts.

40
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,840
Contracts offering twice my salary.

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,180
Incredible, right?

42
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,449
Tell me the truth.

43
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,620
Money's just the excuse
you're hiding behind.

44
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,550
The whole world knows
that I'm in desperate need of money.

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,289
What other reason would I have?

46
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,590
Your attitude right now
couldn't seem more awkward.

47
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,030
Are you even hearing yourself?

48
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,500
Do you know...

49
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,569
what has been the most awkward
for me?

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,939
It was this place.

51
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,909
The people I met here,

52
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,250
the time I spent with them,

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,289
and also...

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,860
It's about time I came to my senses
and got back to where I belong.

55
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,060
That's best for everyone.

56
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,230
(Now that I have permission
to practice medicine,)

57
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,730
(I solemnly pledge my life
to serving mankind.)

59
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,490
(Im Hyun Joon)

60
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,079
(Chapter 14: Selective dyslexia)

61
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,079
(Episode 14)

62
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,050
You're here.

63
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,720
What do you want
so early in the morning?

64
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:51,990
I'm sure you know.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,189
I'm here for the surgery schedule.

66
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:56,459
Haven't you told Dr. Park
what I think about the surgery yet?

67
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,160
I told you I won't open the OR.

68
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,259
Of course, I told him.

69
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,170
But...

70
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,000
he's very persistent on
proceeding with the surgery.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,269
Then he should find
another anesthesiologist.

72
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,810
You're taking things a bit too far.

73
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,439
What?

74
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,810
Dr. Shim.

75
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,379
Did you forget what happened
three years ago?

76
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,420
You almost got fired
from the hospital,

77
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,089
but he protected you
until the very end.

78
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,259
If you're even
the slightest bit grateful,

79
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,089
you shouldn't be doing this to him.

80
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,329
I'm doing this for Dr. Park...

81
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,699
so that he won't end up in trouble.
Don't you get it?

82
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,569
That's why you and I should
stay by his side and support him...

83
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,639
so that this surgery turns out
to be a success.

84
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,769
Because that's what Dr. Park wants.

85
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,009
That's how...

86
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,750
you should repay his kindness,

87
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,810
Dr. Shim.

88
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,490
How is his urine condition?

89
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,860
It's fine.

90
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,730
Let me know if you see a change
in the oxygen saturation.

91
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

92
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,600
Sir, the surgery went well,
so don't worry.

93
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,569
I'll check up on you often.

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,139
Okay.

95
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,939
Keep an eye on him
until this afternoon.

96
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,980
If his blood pressure stays the same
and his urine condition is okay,

97
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,350
you can move him
to the general ward.

98
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,550
Okay, Dr. Seo.

99
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,889
Dr. Seo.

100
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,329
Can I ask you something?

101
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,769
By any chance,
do those loan sharks have...

102
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,800
anything to do with the decision
you made yesterday?

103
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,209
Why do you ask?

104
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,379
No specific reason.

105
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,079
I just want to know.

106
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,649
I don't really want
to talk about it.

107
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,319
Plus, talking about it
won't change anything.

108
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,170
So is Dr. Seo really going to leave?

109
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,680
Yes, apparently.

110
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,009
What a pity.

111
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,649
He was finally
getting used to the place.

112
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,919
Do you think he got blackmailed
by those loan sharks...

113
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,990
or something?

114
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,750
I also think
that might be a possibility.

115
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,690
Judging by his personality,

116
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,159
he doesn't seem like he'd quit
just for money.

117
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,590
He'll be getting paid
twice as much as he does now.

118
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,730
What other reason does he need?

119
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,200
Money is everything in this world.

120
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,899
"Show me the money.
All that money."

121
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,139
That's what you think.

122
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,509
I'm telling you this
based on my hunch.

123
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,639
It's a human being's basic instinct.

124
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,480
Do you still take English lessons?

125
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,809
I paid for a long-term curriculum.

126
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,049
I think I'm pretty good.

127
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,019
Did you take care
of that headhunter?

128
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,889
Well...

129
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,320
Well, kind of.

130
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,059
What's with the vague answer?

131
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,929
Don't tell me
you gave yourself away.

132
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,100
What are you talking about, Dr. Nam?

133
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,429
Come to think of it,

134
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,700
he really is one fickle man.

135
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,740
Ms. Oh, did you just call me fickle?
What do you take me for?

136
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,120
What? Woo Jin is also...

137
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,620
moving to a hospital in Seoul?

138
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:43,919
Who told you that?

139
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,259
That head hunter is
telling everyone...

140
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,559
that he negotiated an agreement
with Dr. Seo...

141
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,759
and that Dr. Seo already
signed everything.

142
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,529
He already signed a contract?

143
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,629
How much of this is true?

144
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,070
Did Dr. Seo really sign a contract?

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,639
Is that a fact?

146
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,340
I heard a few more doctors are...

147
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,039
also getting ready
to sign a contract.

148
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,049
Come to think of it,
I've seen Dr. Jung...

149
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,720
meeting that head hunter
really often these days.

150
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:14,720
Me?

151
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,360
My gosh, that's nonsense.

152
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,889
I met up with him a few times
because we went to the same school.

153
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,029
I'm getting thirsty.

154
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,460
I wonder if I have a cold.

155
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,419
That punk is ruining
the ambiance of the hospital.

156
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,659
Can't we do something
about that head hunter?

157
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,789
Of course, we can.

158
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,929
I'll talk to him myself.

159
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,730
We went to the same university.

160
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,000
And we used to be
in the same study group.

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,769
You all just wait.

162
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,710
Do you know where he is?

163
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,750
(Toilet, Men)

164
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:19,019
Would you like one?

165
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,350
Sure.

166
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,759
Is everything going well?

167
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,929
I'm looking into it,
so you should wait.

168
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,370
I heard you offered Dr. Seo...

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,809
to double his paycheck.

170
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
What?

171
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,779
I know you can't do
the same for me...

172
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,250
since I'm not a doctor.

173
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,509
But you know what I mean, right?

174
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,549
Of course.

175
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,580
I'll make sure
you get a maximum raise.

176
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,490
I'm still negotiating,
so please give it some time.

177
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,759
You'll hear good news.

178
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,629
Please do me a favor
and make sure I get a good deal.

179
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes, okay.

180
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,710
(Lee Yu Ri, Kim In Ae, Baek Jong Ah,
Jo Ye Won, So Mi Ran,)

181
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,379
(Seo Woo Jin)

182
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,629
The WPW syndrome
can often be subclinical.

183
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,659
But if he has A-fib, he could have
a sudden cardiac death.

184
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,600
Not all patients
with WPW syndrome...

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,799
end up dying on the operating table.

186
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Plus, the patient is young,

187
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,809
and we never found any symptoms
in the past.

188
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,009
I know what you're worried about,
but it's very unlikely...

189
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,980
that will happen.

190
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,379
May I ask why you keep...

191
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,580
pushing it so much?

192
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,019
Do you operate on patients
for your personal victory?

193
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,389
I really hope
this surgery goes well.

194
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,429
It's time for you...

195
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,429
to get out of that bus.

196
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,799
Dr. Park.

197
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,610
I'm doing this...

198
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,679
for my patient.

199
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,649
(OR Schedule)

200
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,049
Please don't make me regret this.

201
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh, right.

202
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,029
Why don't you ask Dr. Seo
to help you with the surgery?

203
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,029
It will be open surgery,
not laparoscopic surgery.

204
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,399
And as you already know,
Dr. Yang isn't that good with that.

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,570
I think it'll be better for you
to ask Dr. Seo...

206
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,610
since he's a lot better.

207
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,409
Don't you know what Dr. Park
thinks of that punk?

208
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,379
This is an important surgery.
We can't let that troublemaker...

209
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,320
Because it's an important surgery,

210
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,559
he should be able to put aside
his personal feelings.

211
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,360
Don't you agree, Dr. Yang?

212
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,940
How is the patient?

213
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,740
He's doing okay,

214
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,580
so we're going to move him
to the general ward this afternoon.

215
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,809
I'm going to watch him recover
until tonight,

216
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,379
and I'll be gone tomorrow.

217
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,250
Tomorrow?

218
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,690
Yes.

219
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,460
Then what about the other patients?

220
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,370
My last patient was the one
who came in with an abdomen injury.

221
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,600
That's not what you said to me.

222
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,740
What about this?

223
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,309
You told me to think of you
as my doctor...

224
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,110
until you take out the stitches.

225
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,750
You should take out the stitches
before you leave.

226
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,649
On top of that,

227
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,190
you haven't even diagnosed me yet.

228
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,590
What?

229
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,759
What do you want to know?

230
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,629
Your current condition.

231
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,659
I don't think it has anything to do
with a general surgeon.

232
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,970
But I'm your doctor in charge.

233
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,899
If you tell me your symptoms,
it'll help me make a diagnosis.

234
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,340
Master Kim.

235
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,379
That was...

236
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,009
My elbow symptoms...

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,110
Yes.

238
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,889
What you saw was correct.

239
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,960
It's not just my elbow but
my wrist and back of my neck.

240
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,330
My shoulder blades hurt also,
and I have headaches.

241
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,000
If I operate for
more than two hours,

242
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,269
my back to my thighs and calves...

243
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,600
swell, hurt, and go numb.

244
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,309
In general, these symptoms
could be caused by old age,

245
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,279
or it could be a lack of exercise.

246
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,750
It could be fatigue
or stress-related.

247
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,149
It could be a combination of causes.

248
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:20,549
Doctor.

249
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,190
About twice, I suffered pains...

250
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,289
strong enough to bother me.

251
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,789
The severity of the pain...

252
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,259
was 3 to 4 on the numerical scale.

253
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,360
My digestive issues...

254
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,399
include indigestion and heartburn.

255
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,399
There.

256
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,110
Those are the symptoms
you should know.

257
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,480
If you want a clue,

258
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,080
find it among them.

259
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,159
What? Are you not confident?

260
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,090
This won't change the situation.

261
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,730
I already signed the contract.

262
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,930
Consider this
my last assignment for you.

263
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,940
You came to work for me...

264
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,839
and I think you should
leave with something.

265
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,980
Don't you?

266
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,819
You have until the end of the week.

267
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,720
I'll take extra questions
only twice.

268
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,519
So think carefully before asking.

269
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,759
You have...

270
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,099
only two shots.

271
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,700
That's all.

272
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,160
(President's Office)

273
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,630
Hyun Joon, it's me.

274
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,529
Where are you?

275
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,539
I don't think he's in the lobby.

276
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,170
He's not on the second floor.

277
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,869
Not in the restroom either.

278
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,609
Is he not here yet?

279
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
I found him.

280
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,690
- You found him?
- Where are you?

281
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,019
The doctor's office. I'm hanging up.

282
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,529
How did it go?

283
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,160
Did Seo Woo Jin sign the contract?

284
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,599
Yes. I worked it out
with the thugs last night.

285
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,569
Could you give me a copy of it?

286
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,640
What for?

287
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,210
I need it.

288
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,740
What do you want?

289
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,039
Will you knock first?

290
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,150
I'd like to talk to Hyun Joon.

291
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,869
What did you threaten him with?

292
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,539
What do you mean?

293
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,599
Seo Woo Jin.

294
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,740
He's moving hospitals
because of you, isn't he?

295
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,940
Do you think
he'd respond to threats?

296
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,380
He's going for the extra pay.

297
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,009
He needs money.

298
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,750
Exactly. That is what's so strange.

299
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,690
He's going to get paid twice,

300
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,349
but instead of looking pleased,

301
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,519
why does he look like
he's being forced to go?

302
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,390
Why do you care about that?

303
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,960
What does that have to do with you?

304
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,859
To be honest,
letting a substitute operate.

305
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,630
That was your mistake, Hyun Joon.

306
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,670
Cha Eun Jae!

307
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,200
But you're acting like a victim.

308
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,140
Woo Jin tried to correct it...

309
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,039
and he became the bad guy.

310
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,069
He was boycotted...

311
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,009
and almost got blacklisted.

312
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,640
What is it you want to say?

313
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,250
Despite that, Woo Jin...

314
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,119
never once said
a bad thing about you.

315
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,849
"It was Hyun Joon's doing."

316
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,589
"I feel wronged."

317
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,789
Never once did I hear him
whine or complain.

318
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,930
But what about you?

319
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,630
Why come all the way here
to torture him?

320
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,230
His career went out of the window
because he trusted you.

321
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,799
He finally calmed down...

322
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,769
and is settling in at Doldam.

323
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,309
Was that such an eyesore?

324
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,079
Were you that jealous?

325
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,579
Is that why you're doing this?

326
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,009
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,119
What are you doing?

328
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,160
Did you sleep with him?

329
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,299
My gosh. What did he just say?

330
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,000
Is he out of...

331
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,400
Calm down. If you go in now,
it'll blow up into a huge fight.

332
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,470
- Step aside.
- You can't go in.

333
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,339
Grab him. Do something!

334
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,380
Don't, Dr. Seo.

335
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,009
What did you just say?

336
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,319
It's not like you're his wife.

337
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,250
Why are you so upset about
what happens to Woo Jin?

338
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,019
It has to be what I'm thinking.

339
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,390
Is it not?

340
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,289
That's enough, Ho Jun.

341
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,930
It's a small world, Eun Jae.

342
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,599
Your reputation...

343
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,369
could become just as filthy
if you hang out with him.

344
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,400
Watch out.

345
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,650
(Doctor's Office 4)

346
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,660
Are you crazy?
How dare you hit a senior's head?

347
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,000
You hit my head first!

348
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,029
- What?
- You didn't use a fist,

349
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,299
but it was the same...

350
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,440
No.

351
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,640
You used much dirtier
and displeasing tactics than a fist!

352
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,569
You were just as violent!

353
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,549
- Hey!
- Don't call me that, Yang Ho Jun!

354
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,150
What?

355
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,180
"Yang Ho Jun"? You called my name?

356
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,420
As of this moment, to me,

357
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,259
you're no longer a senior.

358
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,529
Don't act up anymore
just because you're older.

359
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,559
And!

360
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,670
Stop acting like you're the victim.

361
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,099
You're all such jokes.

Yes, Dr. Park.

365
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

Kang Ik Joon's Whipple procedure.

369
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,059
It's scheduled for 2pm.

370
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,299
I want you to be
the first assistance.

371
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,009
Please say no.

372
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,140
Why won't you answer?

373
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,680
You won't scrub in?

374
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,210
Let it go.

375
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,980
I understand.

376
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,920
I'll scrub in.

377
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,220
Get ready and
come to the monitor room.

378
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,349
I have something to tell you
beforehand.

379
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,119
About what?

380
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,690
I have a contractual issue.

381
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,569
A contractual issue?
What do you mean?

382
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,569
The truth is, yesterday,
I signed a contract with Hyun Joon.

383
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,869
A hospital in Seoul
offered twice the pay.

384
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,019
The contract states
I can only work here until today.

385
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,519
I'd like you to adjust that for me.

386
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,190
How much time?

387
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,529
Consider this
my last assignment for you.

388
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,369
You have until the end of the week.

389
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,670
Until this week.

390
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:58,940
This week?

391
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,269
Shouldn't I be able to observe...

392
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,869
how today's patient does
after surgery?

393
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,039
I think until the end of this week
should work.

394
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,349
I'll have that adjusted.

395
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,450
Anything else?

396
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,180
I heard the patient has
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

397
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,289
We already consulted
an internist for that.

398
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,920
There are no problems?

399
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,289
Even the picky Dr. Shim cleared it.

400
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,359
You don't need to worry.

401
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,500
Okay then.

402
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,740
I'll get ready and
meet you in the OR.

403
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,390
Dr. Yang,

404
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,059
is there something else
I should also know about?

405
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,589
Take it. I'm guessing it's yours.

406
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,339
Who gave the orders?

407
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,039
Sorry?

408
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Do Yun Wan?

409
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,779
Dr. Park Min Guk?

410
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:52,950
No, none of the above.

411
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,549
I just heard rumors...

412
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,190
that Doldam had
a lot of talented medical staff.

413
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,420
If that's the case,

414
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,529
you should've come to me first.

415
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,829
Out of everyone here,
I'm the most experienced...

416
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,799
and competent surgeon.

417
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,599
I'd have to be insane
to try and poach you of all people.

418
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,410
But you ended up
provoking me anyway.

419
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,289
(Doctor's Name, Doldam Hospital,
Jung In Soo)

420
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,890
I checked the hospitals
on this list.

421
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,599
They've been reprimanded
for at least...

422
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,269
1 or 2 illegal procedures.

423
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,640
Some only paid a fine,

424
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,809
but some had to shut down
their operations for months.

425
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,940
However, they still haven't
kicked the habit...

426
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,440
of conducting illegal procedures.

427
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,849
If you're going to poach
doctors and nurses for a commission,

428
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,279
at least connect them
to decent hospitals.

429
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,750
I guess it says a lot about them...

430
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,390
if they have to turn
to you of all people...

431
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,990
to hire new medical staff.

432
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
I want that back.

433
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,460
You sold out your family
and your conscience for money...

434
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,000
and trampled on
a junior doctor's life.

435
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Now you're trying to ruin the lives
of other doctors too?

436
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,910
I'm doing this to make a living.

437
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:26,309
This is the only thing I can do
to keep food on the table.

438
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,509
You're broke and angry at the world?

439
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,750
People belittle you
and stomp on your pride?

440
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,819
Still, there's one thing
you should never compromise.

441
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,119
It's your conscience.

442
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,490
How far have you gone
to keep that intact?

443
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,529
What have you been willing to lose?

444
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,930
You live just any way you want
by feeding your greed.

445
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,230
For money, you are willing
to sell your conscience...

446
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,299
and do just about anything.

447
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,140
You even sell your soul.

448
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,170
I tried my best, you know!

449
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,980
I tried my best to live
with a clear conscience,

450
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,579
but the world wouldn't let me.

451
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,180
My life is just as unfair!

452
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,119
Don't confuse your greed
for your conscience.

453
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,390
No wonder you feel like...

454
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,630
you've been wronged.

455
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,470
I feel bad for you.

456
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,549
Eun Jae, are you there?

457
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,420
Yes. Why?

458
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,789
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,029
About what?

460
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,730
Because of me,

461
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,640
he made false accusations.

462
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,140
How is that your fault?

463
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,670
They're the ones to blame
for having...

464
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,539
their minds in the gutter.

465
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,509
Anyway, stop siding with me.

466
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,849
Don't stand up for me either.

467
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,789
Got it?

468
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,490
But I want to.

469
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,259
I don't want
to run away from them...

470
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,859
because they scare me...

471
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,799
or stay silent even though
I have something to say.

472
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,740
I won't.

473
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,480
I won't live that way anymore.

474
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,109
Are you even listening to me?

475
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,390
No, you listen to me.

476
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:53,089
I don't want you to be
accused like that because of me.

477
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,619
But we're allies.

478
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,059
Aren't allies supposed
to have each other's backs?

479
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
That's what I'll ask of you
when I'm in trouble.

480
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,170
When I need help,
I'll ask you for a ton of favors.

481
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,910
Although...

482
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,980
that'd be a wild dream
if you leave this hospital.

483
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,509
Still,

484
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,609
you won't find a colleague
like me anywhere else.

485
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,450
I'm smart, quick on my feet,

486
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,819
and I've even disconnect myself
from my mom now.

487
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,359
I can even perform surgeries
without passing out too.

488
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,730
What are you getting at?

489
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm telling you to stay.

490
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,369
You said we should
stay here forever.

491
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,599
You suggested that first, remember?

492
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,539
Right?

493
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,650
You're walking on a thin line.

494
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,779
What will you do...

495
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,250
if I finally cross the line?

496
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,359
What then?

497
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,369
You know what? Forget about it.

498
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,019
Ms. Uhm, have you seen Dr. Jung?

499
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,289
I'm not sure.
He hasn't been around for a while.

500
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,890
- Can you call him?
- Sure.

501
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,160
- Let me take this.
- Okay.

502
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,299
Yes, this is Doldam's ER.

503
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,829
Yes, that's right.

504
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,309
What?

505
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,579
(Employment Contract)

506
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,579
(Jung In Soo)

507
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,190
(Jung In Soo)

508
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,299
Gosh, no.

509
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,069
(Jung In Soo)

510
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,309
Mr. Park.

511
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:28,440
Is this...

512
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,579
yours, Dr. Jung?

513
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,750
Well...

514
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,390
Well, I...

515
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,460
It's the ER calling.

516
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,799
(Employment Contract)

517
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,920
What kind of patient
are we expecting?

518
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,860
It's a 60-year-old male...

519
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,030
who collapsed
due to late-stage lung cancer.

520
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,400
The paramedics are
bringing him here.

521
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,170
Okay.

522
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,329
But the thing is...

523
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,039
What is it?

524
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,010
It's President Yeo.

525
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,409
What?

526
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,780
Incoming!

527
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,929
This way.

528
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,739
Let's move him. 1, 2, 3.

529
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,840
Let's take this off.

530
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,010
- What was his BST results?
- It was 75.

531
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,179
Right now, it's 72.

532
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,480
Give him D10W fluids.

533
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,550
And give him two ampules
of thiamine through the IV.

534
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,849
I also want you to take his BST
every 30 minutes.

535
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,190
I'll proceed with an ABGA.

536
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,889
His saturation is 92 percent.
Should I give him oxygen?

537
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,159
Give him 6 liters of oxygen.

538
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,130
And run the operation laboratory
test and an electrolyte test.

539
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,030
What's your name?

540
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:33,969
Kang Ik Joon.

541
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,969
- What's the surgery for?
- Pancreatic cancer.

542
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,210
I'm going to anesthetize you now.

543
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,079
Take in a deep breath.

544
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,110
Give him oxygen.

545
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,280
This is oxygen.

546
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,860
Let's do an A-line monitoring.
Give me what I need.

547
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,829
Turn the EKG monitor
so that I can see it properly.

548
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,530
And I want five ECG leads.

549
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,829
Five leads?

550
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,369
Isn't it normally three?

551
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,730
I want five.

552
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,250
Is Dr. Seo going to be here?

553
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,889
Yes, he's going to be
the first assistant.

554
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,599
May I begin, Dr. Shim?

555
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,900
Yes, you may begin.

556
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,710
This patient, Kang Ik Joon,
has pancreas head cancer.

557
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,769
And we will now begin
the Whipple's operation.

558
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,280
Scalpel.

559
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,309
Gauze.

560
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,780
Bovie.

561
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,190
Retractor.

562
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:01,260
What are you doing? Retractor!

563
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,530
Oh, right. Retractor.

564
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,530
If you're not going to stay focused,
get out of here!

565
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,929
- I apologize.
- Sponge stick.

(Doldam Hospital)

567
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,340
You promised to give us
the down payment tomorrow.

568
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,500
Don't even think about running away.

569
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,940
See?

570
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:52,010
I told you it had something to do
with the loan sharks.

571
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,380
You're right.

572
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,679
I guess they asked him
for the down payment.

573
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,179
I know some professional guys
who can help us with this.

(Baekjang Distribution,

575

- Thank you for your help!
- Thank you for your help!

If you need our help
with anything at all,

577
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,900
please don't hesitate to call us.

578
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,809
I'm thinking about
asking them for help.

579
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,639
What do you think?

580
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,639
That will only cause trouble.

581
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,050
Why don't you let me handle it?

582
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,420
I'd appreciate that, Dr. Cha.

583
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,400
All he ever does is study bones.
He can't do anything.

584
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,019
Hello?

585
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,820
Hello, I'm Cha Eun Jae,

586
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,690
the person who's second in line
at Doldam Hospital.

587
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,130
Yes, that's right.
I'm glad you remember.

588
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,349
Yes, I know.

589
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,750
If I get involved,
my dad will find out.

590
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,789
But...

591
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,920
if I hide again,

592
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,489
I feel like I'll really regret it.

593
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,730
See you, Elizabeth.

594
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
You too, Jessie.

595
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,510
I don't see a mass.

596
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,250
I don't see any bleeding.

597
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,449
And it doesn't look like
brain edema either.

598
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:16,690
That means his unconsciousness
isn't due to his brain.

599
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,559
- Here's the test result.
- How does it look?

600
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,420
He has severe hyponatremia,
and he also has rhabdomyolysis.

601
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,860
Connect a foley catheter, and
carry out a urine chemistry test.

602
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,260
I'll do it.

603
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,670
Okay.

604
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,730
Should I give him 3 percent NaCl?

605
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,269
There's a high possibility
that he might have hypovolemia.

606
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,539
So let's hydrate him
with normal saline first.

607
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:40,039
And I want his electrolyte
test results every two hours.

608
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,650
Sir, he's having a seizure!

609
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,849
(Seizure: A sudden
disturbance in the brain)

610
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:46,920
It's a V-fib.

611
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,650
I'll do chest compression.

612
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,949
- Dr. Jung.
- What?

613
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,139
No way.

614
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,840
Did he sign a DNR form?

615
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,619
Master Kim.

616
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,630
Master Kim, please.

617
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,000
Master Kim!

618
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,079
Master Kim!

619
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,269
Chest compression.

620
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,940
Ms. Uhm, we need a defibrillator.
Hurry!

621
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,789
Metzenbaum scissors.

622
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Tie.

623
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,900
How is the patient's condition?

624
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,440
He's doing okay.

625
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,710
- Cut.
- Okay. Cut.

626
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,480
What's going on?

627
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,250
It's a V-tach.

628
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:07,559
I think he's having an A-fib
due to the WPW syndrome.

629
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,429
- I still feel a pulse.
- What's his BP?

630
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:14,699
80 over 40, sir.

631
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Synchronized cardioversion.
150 joules.

632
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,969
Remove the drape.

633
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,940
200 joules.

634
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,619
- Charged.
- Step back!

635
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,590
Clear!

636
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,460
- Compression.
- Let me take over.

637
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,829
Inject 1mg of epinephrine
every three minutes through the IV.

638
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,099
- Intubate.
- Okay.

639
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:55,739
What are you doing?

640
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:58,010
- Do it properly!
- Okay!

641
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,119
Ambu bag.

642
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,900
1mg of epinephrine
every three minutes through the IV.

643
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,139
Ambu bag.

644
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,610
Checking his heartbeat!

645
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,820
Charge to 200 joules.

646
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,050
- Take this.
- Okay.

647
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,019
- It's charged.
- Step back!

648
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,590
Clear!

649
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,159
Compression.

650
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,340
Don't squeeze too fast!

651
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,610
- Watch the clock! Six seconds!
- Okay.

652
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,280
Checking heartbeat!

653
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,019
Again, 200 joules.

654
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,289
- It's charged.
- Step back.

655
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
Clear!

656
00:45:58,829 --> 00:45:59,900
Compression.

657
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,829
300mg of amiodarone!

658
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:04,670
300mg of amiodarone.

659
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,210
Checking heartbeat!

660
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,320
Asystole.

661
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,889
(Asystole: Absence
of ventricular contractions)

662
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,809
Checking heartbeat!

663
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,710
ROSC. He's back.

664
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,829
I think...

665
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,130
you should call it.

666
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,780
(Current Time, 17:39)

667
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,619
5:39pm.

668
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,789
Patient Kang Ik Joon expired.

669
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,389
You son of a witch.

670
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,980
WPW syndrome.

671
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,719
Are you sure
you consulted an internist?

672
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,150
What do you mean?

673
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,289
Was Dr. Shim involved
entirely voluntarily?

674
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,119
Was this surgery rushed and forced?

675
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:56,630
That's what I'm asking.

676
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,289
You won't be held responsible.

677
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,530
This is your last day
at Doldam Hospital.

678
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,070
I was told if I scrubbed in,
I'm allowed to stay until this week.

679
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,139
That's when you have
a living patient to observe.

680
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,780
He died.

681
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,980
Didn't he?

682
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,449
He is stable for now.

683
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,019
But...

684
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,619
But what?

685
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,400
President Yeo signed a DNR form.

686
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,800
Master Kim went against it
to revive him.

687
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Hey. Did you get my text?

688
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,570
Yes. It so happened.

689
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,880
Master Kim's struggling.

690
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,710
So is everyone else here.

691
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,650
I only ask because I'm curious.

692
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,920
Why did you follow me out?

693
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,849
Come to think of it,

694
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,659
you were talented enough
to stay at that hospital.

695
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:47,300
Your career would've been
on a far better path.

696
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:52,500
I'm wondering why
you joined my hospital instead.

697
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,369
Because you wanted us
to show the world.

698
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,280
You wanted to show the world...

699
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,210
that people like us could also...

700
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,820
live a good life.

701
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,320
That's what you said.

702
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,429
I...

703
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:22,630
really wanted a decent life.

704
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,139
My parents and my aunt...

705
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,940
probably thought...

706
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,619
that it'd be easier with me dead.

707
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:47,820
That's why I threw myself at life
with everything I had.

708
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,460
Just to show...

709
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,599
that I was also worthy of...

710
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,599
a decent life.

711
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,110
I wanted to show the world...

712
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,980
that I had what it takes...

713
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,380
to have one.

714
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,349
It's why I admired you.

715
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,389
You told me...

716
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,789
that even someone like me
was worth something.

717
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,230
That's why.

718
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,210
You're unbelievable.

719
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:43,809
I truly wanted
to lift the boycott on you,

720
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,150
but a jerk like you...

721
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,889
You need to rot more
in a crappy hospital like this one.

722
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,630
Judging by how cranky Masker Kim is,

723
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,090
you've got your work
cut out for you.

724
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,900
Just know...

725
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:03,159
that I'll be keeping tabs on you.

726
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,170
So...

727
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,269
live a decent life.

728
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:11,869
Got it?

729
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,340
Show the world what you're made of.

730
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,079
All right?

731
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,389
(Employment Contract)

732
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,780
Mun Jung.

733
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,489
Where's Dr. Seo?

734
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,489
He's still here.

735
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:36,489
Actually,

736
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,530
I've been keeping him here.

737
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,070
Dr. Seo, are you heading home?

738
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,369
Yes, I guess.

739
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,599
Give it back already.

740
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:49,869
What?

741
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,369
Oh, okay.

742
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,980
It seems like you have a visitor.

743
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,730
Woo Jin.

744
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,809
Why are you here again?

745
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:28,639
Must you seriously
harass me some more?

746
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,880
I'm sorry, Woo Jin.

747
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,519
I'm sorry for harassing you,

748
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,119
beating you up,
and making you pay...

749
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:45,460
unreasonable interest.

750
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm just as sorry too.

751
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:56,139
Satisfied?

752
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,840
What is this?

753
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,110
You paid back
the money you borrowed...

754
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,949
and all the interest.

755
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:09,849
All that's left...

756
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,920
Well, consider it paid.

757
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,420
What?

758
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,860
So anyway,

759
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:19,429
this is where we part ways.

760
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,760
We're saying...

761
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,969
goodbye.

762
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,900
Let's go.

763
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:31,369
Let's never cross paths again.

764
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:33,539
Got it?

765
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,019
What's going on?
Are they really just leaving?

766
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,519
They won't come back?

767
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,090
Yes, that's what they said.

768
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:08,980
Baekjang Distribution
didn't disappoint.

769
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,610
What was that?

770
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:13,949
What? Oh, it's nothing
you need to know.

771
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:16,920
(Doldam Hospital)

772
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:25,260
I hope you politely
gave him your message.

773
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,570
Your elder asked you a question.

774
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,269
Where's the proper response?

775
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,599
Did you tell Dr. Cha,
the second most important doctor...

776
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,309
at Doldam,

777
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,170
and her friend Dr. Seo...

778
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:44,050
that you would never
show up ever again?

779
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,119
I'm asking you a question.

780
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,280
Look here.

781
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,650
You lot aren't the reason
why we're here.

782
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,119
Unbelievable.

783
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:59,730
You've got to hand it to them
for having pride. Okay, fine.

784
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,599
I won't go anywhere...

785
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,530
and spread rumors about this.

786
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,199
So you boys...

787
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,300
What are you doing?

788
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:14,139
Don't you ever come this way again.

789
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:17,349
Doldam Hospital and
this part of Jeongseon...

790
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:19,650
are our district.

791
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:23,449
I hope you get what I mean.

792
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:32,690
Let's go.

793
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:39,429
Yes, get going.

794
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,239
We won't walk you out.

795
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,039
- Boss.
- Yes?

796
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,409
Over there.

797
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:47,710
My goodness.

798
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,380
Boys, where are your manners?

799
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,880
The second most important doctor
at Doldam...

800
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,820
is smiling at us.

801
01:01:57,289 --> 01:02:00,250
Let us all show our respect.

802
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,420
- Good night, Dr. Cha!
- Good night, Dr. Cha!

803
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,369
The second most important doctor?
Awesome.

804
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,730
It's a pick-me-up.

805
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,300
I'm good.

806
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:48,199
I totally understand
Master Kim's decision.

807
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,510
I do too, but...

808
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,880
I can't say
what he did was right though.

809
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:01,550
Never...

810
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:05,789
have I questioned
his decision before,

811
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,420
but I'm not so sure this time.

812
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:18,929
Master Kim probably
feels the same way.

813
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,119
Master Kim.

814
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:42,289
You should get some rest.
I'll stay here instead.

815
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:44,860
I went...

816
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:49,559
against what he wanted.

817
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:55,670
I'm sure...

818
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,539
he'll understand.

819
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,210
I'll have to deal with...

820
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,909
what happened today...

821
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,920
for the rest of my life.

822
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,320
(My son)

823
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:54,800
Hey, Yul.

824
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,130
Yes.

825
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:03,039
I couldn't pick up
because I was doing surgery.

826
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,579
What?

827
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:14,820
Of course.

828
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,179
Yes, he lived.

829
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,460
Yes.

830
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:30,530
What about you? Did you finish
your lesson at the academy?

831
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,219
(Chairman Do Yun Wan)

832
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,329
Hello, Park Min Guk speaking.

833
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,800
I just heard some bad news.

834
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,440
I heard he died
on the operating table.

835
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,840
Are the chairman of Sejin Group
and his wife aware of this?

836
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,139
They probably...

837
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,679
would've heard by now.

838
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,590
I clearly told you...

839
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:27,190
that they're very important to us.

840
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,690
How could you make another mistake?

841
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:33,489
I'll take responsibility
for everything that happens...

842
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,530
from now on.

843
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:39,070
You'll need to do more
than just resign...

844
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:41,699
from your position.

845
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,809
What do you mean?

846
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,909
Listen to me carefully, Dr. Park.

847
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,380
This might be...

848
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,119
your only chance to survive.

849
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:20,639
Come in.

850
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,019
What do you need?

851
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,920
About that homework
you offered to give me yesterday...

852
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,190
Yes?

853
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:32,750
I'll take it.

854
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,829
You can only ask two questions.
That's it.

855
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:45,630
Do I get any hints?

856
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,070
What?

857
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,539
Okay, fine.

858
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:53,969
And one more thing.

859
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,880
What is it this time?

860
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:58,309
About the money I owe you...

861
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,820
Can I continue to pay you back...

862
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,389
1,000 dollars every month
like I used to?

863
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:06,519
Why?

864
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:07,960
I thought there's
a hospital in Seoul...

865
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,590
that offered you
twice the current paycheck.

866
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,159
Didn't things turn out very well?

867
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:14,829
Well, kind of.
They refused to hire me.

868
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,670
I was told to rot here for longer.

869
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,140
Take it with you.

870
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,680
What's this?

871
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:31,109
You asked for a hint.

872
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:32,449
(Oddball Project)

873
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,079
Isn't this a bit too much?

874
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,920
(Oddball Project)

875
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,859
If you read through all these files,

876
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,489
you'll find something
that will be of help.

877
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,430
Now, you only get to ask...

878
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:54,300
one more question.

879
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,300
What?

880
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:58,270
You're going to count this
as a question?

881
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,569
Do you have a problem?

882
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:02,779
If you have a problem,
you can just give up.

883
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,350
(Oddball Project)

884
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:20,060
Back then,
I had absolutely no idea.

885
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,899
(Oddball Project)

886
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,460
I didn't know...

887
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:27,329
the meaning
behind the Oddball Project.

888
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,390
(Doldam Hospital)

889
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:48,890
Is that...

890
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:51,989
No way.

891
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,409
This place hasn't changed at all.

892
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:18,050
Did you take care
of that headhunter?

893
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:20,789
Don't tell me
you gave yourself away.

894
01:10:20,789 --> 01:10:21,859
What are you talking about, Dr. Nam?

895
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:25,960
Come to think of it,
he really is one fickle man.

896
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,600
Ms. Oh, did you just call me fickle?

897
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:29,159
What do you take me for?

898
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,180
If you're interested,
feel free to call me whenever.

899
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,880
I'll find you a great job.

900
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,210
I'm looking into it,
so you should wait.

901
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,960
Good work, Manager Jang.

902
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,229
But why do you want me
to keep this a secret?

903
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,699
"Don't let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing."

904
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:48,010
it's just my fate as a lonely hero.

905
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,380
What do you call someone
who's fickle in English?

906
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,520
Dr. Nam.

907
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
How would he know that in English?

908
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,819
Do you know what an apple is?

909
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:01,260
- Are you serious?
- What is it?

910
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,119
It's apple. Did you think
I'd say Steve Jobs?

911
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,189
You're unbelievable.

912
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:06,359
Then how do you say pineapple?

913
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,159
It's pineapple.

914
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,579
(Dr. Romantic 2)

915
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,180
How is his brain?

916
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,720
You saw Dr. Do In Beom?

917
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,550
What are you doing here?

918
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:34,989
Will you stop?

919
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:36,020
Why? Can't you see?

920
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,359
I guess your sight
isn't as good as your hands.

921
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,630
Their goal...

922
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,430
is to find whatever reason they can
to shut down Doldam Hospital.

923
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,770
It looks like they're even trying
to get rid of Dr. Shim.

924
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,770
What did you just do, Dr. Seo?

925
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:49,399
I won't let anyone do anything...

926
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,010
to Doldam Hospital or Master Kim.

927
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,939
You little punk!
Do you have a deathwish?

928
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:56,710
I won't let anyone
mess with this place.
