1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,049
Hand it over.

2
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,619
No.

3
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,890
I'll hold onto this.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,420
You know who the doctor was?

5
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,329
Then tell whoever it is
to inform the patient.

6
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,859
Seo Woo Jin!

7
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,130
I will wait until tomorrow evening.

8
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,399
As a doctor myself,
I'd at least do that much.

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,469
Do you know
who the operating surgeon is?

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,680
Must I know?

11
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,140
I feel like you should.

12
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,680
Who is it?

13
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,219
Cha Eun Jae.

14
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,060
Who?

15
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,989
The operating surgeon
who cut the bile duct.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,900
It was Dr. Cha's brother.

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,400
So what brings you by?

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,640
I heard about your condition.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,739
(Episode 12)

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,170
I came running over
as soon as I heard.

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,780
I'm deeply worried, you know.

22
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,810
Is it true that you have
carpal tunnel syndrome?

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,319
Says who?

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,620
I went golfing yesterday
with Chairman Do.

25
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,219
That man truly is amazing though.

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,790
He knows everything about you.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,060
One might even call him a stalker.

28
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,329
He must be fond of you.

29
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,799
Hey, quit the nonsense...

30
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,030
and tell me why you're here.

31
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,439
How about a beverage first?

32
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,139
There's a water dispenser outside.

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,150
Unbelievable.

34
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,650
Treat me better, will you?

35
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,990
I came here as an ally.

36
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,189
How about you just leave?

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,689
Have you heard of Mirae Hospital?

38
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,490
Because of it,

39
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,129
land value in this area
has been on the rise.

40
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,830
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,469
I knew it.

42
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,069
Of course, you're clueless.

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,370
Where do you think
that the new hospital...

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,710
will be built?

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,780
Yes, exactly.

46
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,349
Right here where Doldam stands.

47
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,919
Doldam will be torn down...

48
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,520
to make room for it.

49
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,990
A place for the five percent...

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
that have money to buy their health.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,330
The new hospital will serve
as a private facility for the rich.

52
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,599
A single two-week program...

53
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,639
will give them back
at least 5 to 10 years.

54
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,310
Park Min Guk was sent here
to fast-track the entire project.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,210
He has probably...

56
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,580
already begun the sorting process.

57
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,650
Sort whom?

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,319
He's hoping that those at Doldam...

59
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,219
will work at the new hospital...

60
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,419
and has begun
stirring up your employees...

61
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,789
by firing those
that stand against him.

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,560
The choice is yours.

63
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,729
You can insist
on informing the patient...

64
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,370
and make things worse...

65
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,939
or...

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,139
do as I say and let it slide.

67
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,680
Tell me by tomorrow evening.

68
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,659
A rash sense of justice...

69
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,060
always comes at a price.

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,430
He was an extremely
competent surgeon.

71
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,500
But because of his darn
sense of justice,

72
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,740
he was banned from the OR
for about a year.

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,310
He barely got to operate again.

74
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,110
Wouldn't it be too harsh to take
that opportunity away from him...

75
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,810
just because of that darn
sense of justice?

76
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,149
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,680
Don't act naive.

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,050
You know how things work
in this field.

79
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,360
You really shouldn't
incite him like that.

80
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,430
He already has a difficult life.

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,699
Don't get him too riled up about...

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,540
being a conscientious,
responsible, and a just doctor.

83
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,240
He'll only end up feeling miserable.

84
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,540
Do you understand, Ms. Oh?

85
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,959
They used the application.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,399
They apparently don't know
what to do next.

87
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm so jealous.
They seem so relaxed.

88
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,540
Just three days' worth
of this medicine will do.

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,250
Hello, sir.

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,949
Yes, I just told him
what you asked me to tell him.

91
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,759
Yes, of course.

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,860
Now, he'll start butting heads
with Min Guk.

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,529
Good work.

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,230
Let's play golf again next weekend.

95
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,629
Okay, bye.

96
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,029
(Chapter 12: The error
in the exchange of equivalents)

97
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,170
It's not complicated.

98
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,240
They're willing to pay this much
because you're competent.

99
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,339
I can get you...

100
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,779
a 50 percent raise
from your current annual salary.

101
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,120
A 50 percent raise?

102
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,560
I don't think I'm relevant.
I'm still a resident.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,220
Bye then.

104
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,199
You can easily get a raise...

105
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,129
according to your workload
and position.

106
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,670
Really?

107
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,339
I've actually been thinking about it
a lot these days.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,209
I've been living away from my family
for almost three years.

109
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,449
I'd love to go to the main hospital,
but it's always full there.

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,680
No, it's okay. Why don't you
do this somewhere else?

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,779
Ms. Uhm.

112
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,519
I'm more interested in learning
than making money right now.

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,860
But still,
he's willing to get us a raise.

114
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,290
Nothing is for free.

115
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,459
And you can't get a free upgrade.

116
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,060
The better the offer,
the more you'll have to pay.

117
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,930
That's a quote by Ms. Oh.

118
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,170
Ms. Uhm.

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,699
I'll be off now.

120
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,910
Can I also get an advance...

121
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,509
and receive 50 percent
of my annual salary beforehand?

122
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,779
No, never mind.

123
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,180
Is it possible though?

124
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,949
The thing is,
my wife wishes to move...

125
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,220
so our kid can get
a better education.

126
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,589
Yes, of course.
As long as you make up your mind.

127
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,620
Really?

128
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,360
I'll do my best.

129
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,600
Dr. Jung. Dr. Jung?

130
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,199
- Yes?
- Dr. Bae, did you just call me?

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,470
What were you thinking about?

132
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,500
Nothing much.

133
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,410
I get worried every time
I talk to my wife on the phone.

134
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,339
Do you need anything?

135
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,680
The ER is way too relaxed today.

136
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,509
There are no emergency patients.

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,220
Dr. Bae, don't you know yet?

138
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,450
They're stopping all the patients...

139
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,049
from coming here.

140
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm sorry. The ORs are full.

141
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,460
Please find another ER.

142
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,700
Aren't all the operating rooms
empty right now?

143
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,029
President Park
only wishes to treat patients...

144
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,940
who make appointments beforehand.

145
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,639
For the time being...
Actually, I don't think...

146
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,580
we'll get any emergency
trauma patients anymore.

147
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,980
What?

148
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,049
Hello, this is the ER
at Doldam Hospital.

149
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,279
I'm sorry.
We can't accept any patients.

150
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,590
Please find another hospital.

151
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,960
At this rate,
the ER might just disappear.

152
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:18,100
So they're just
sending away all the patients?

153
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,769
Yes, sir. And you need to see this.

154
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,500
He's an alumnus,
but I don't know him very well.

155
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,669
But I heard
he's close with Dr. Yang.

156
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,779
And apparently,
he's at Doldam Hospital right now.

157
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,909
He's the guy that had a feud
with Dr. Seo at Samjin Hospital.

158
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,090
Are you seeing any progress?

159
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,690
Dr. Jung In Soo from EM
seems interested.

160
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,720
(EM: Emergency Medicine)

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,830
What about the others?

162
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,929
When you scout people,

163
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,860
they're normally
very negative at first.

164
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,330
But you need to keep
interacting with them...

165
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,769
and constantly talk about
the employment conditions.

166
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,970
That's how they come around.

167
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,909
What a cunning jerk.

168
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,179
How is Woo Jin doing?

169
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,840
Woo Jin might end up...

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
ruining another doctor's career.

171
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,779
Again? Who is it this time?

172
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,080
There's this girl named Cha Eun Jae,

173
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,049
and there's something
going on between them.

174
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,720
But unfortunately, it's her brother.

175
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,639
Shouldn't you be busy?

176
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,710
I am.

177
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,139
Then why aren't you
doing anything?

178
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,419
I have something to think about.

179
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,850
Why? Do you have
trouble with something?

180
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,289
You told me your brother
is also a doctor, right?

181
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,320
Yes.

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,730
He's a general surgeon like you.

183
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,929
He's the vice-president of
a pretty famous hospital in Seoul.

184
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,370
He's very proud of himself.

185
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,240
Are you close with your brother?

186
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,139
I'm not sure.

187
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,879
We're pretty mean to each other,

188
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,049
but at the same time,

189
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,220
we care about each other a lot.

190
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,980
We're just the typical
type of siblings.

191
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,190
But why do you suddenly
want to know about my brother?

192
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,470
Eun Jae.

193
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,799
Just a second.

194
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,539
Hey, Mom.

195
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,179
Yes, I have time to talk.

196
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,039
Why? What is it?

197
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,889
What? You're going to come here?

198
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,259
He's in a huge pickle.

199
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,629
Aren't you going to help him?

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
Not yet.

201
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,970
By the way, why do you keep
using me as a spy...

202
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,139
if you're not going to do anything?

203
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,879
You're not a spy.

204
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,879
But I still need to know
what's going on.

205
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,379
Let me ask you something
out of curiosity.

206
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,450
Why aren't you doing anything?

207
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,559
You know you can
turn the tables around.

208
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,759
If you want, you can even
get rid of President Park.

209
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,000
The hidden card...

210
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,470
should always come last.

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,299
What if you miss the right timing?

212
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,570
This time, you could end up
losing someone, sir.

213
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,019
Something doesn't feel right
these days.

214
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,690
I can't even focus on work.

215
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,289
Don't get influenced
so easily, Ms. Joo.

216
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,330
It's because I even heard
a weird rumor about Master Kim.

217
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,759
What weird rumor?

218
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,129
What is it?

219
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,710
Tell me.

220
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,509
What's the weird rumor?

221
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
The thing is,
I heard Master Kim collapsed...

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,820
because he has an illness,
not because he was injured.

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,789
So what?

224
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,120
I heard he even dropped a scalpel
during surgery...

225
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,690
because he couldn't
move his fingers.

226
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,259
The scrub nurses think
that's why we decided...

227
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,070
not to accept
any more trauma patients.

228
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,970
And what else?

229
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
And apparently, Dr. Nam...

230
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,840
That's enough.
You don't need to hear this.

231
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,110
Tell me.

232
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,740
What about Dr. Nam?

233
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,740
Apparently, he got fired.

234
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,210
That's why he can't come here.

235
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,220
Ms. Joo, why would you say
things like that?

236
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,320
They're just rumors.

237
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,950
Ms. Oh asked first.

238
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,889
My gosh. Here you all are.

239
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,669
Was there an urgent meeting?

240
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,570
It was about tasks in the ER.

241
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,000
We were just wrapping up.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,769
I heard all of your concerns,

243
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,740
so return to your stations, please.

244
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,639
Okay. Let's all get back to work.

245
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,120
See you. Do your thing.

246
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,769
Ms. Oh and Mr. Park
are very concerned about him.

247
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,470
They're afraid we'll burden him.

248
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,009
What if this is our fault?

249
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,279
What if that's why
he keeps overexerting himself?

250
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,750
There aren't any problems,
are there, Ms. Oh?

251
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,090
Of course not. No problems.

252
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,159
Excuse me then.

253
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,700
Do you know something?

254
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,639
You aren't burdens.
You're my strength.

255
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,080
You, Do Il, and Eun Tak.

256
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,779
Everyone at Doldam Hospital.

257
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,990
Just in case you forgot.

258
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,169
You know that, right?

259
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,009
Yes, I do.

260
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,009
Good.

261
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,320
Officer Goo, it's Master Kim.

262
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,730
That's what I called you about.

263
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,359
I must ask you for a favor.

264
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,410
Ms. Oh.

265
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,440
Are you leaving already?

266
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,009
Yes.

267
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,549
I don't think there will be any
emergency patients or surgery.

268
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,420
Really? Then shall we
leave together?

269
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,920
How about a drink at On Your Way...

270
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,150
No, no.

271
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,019
I'd like you to deal with
this person first.

272
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,490
Sort him out.

273
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,660
(Im Hyun Joon)

274
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,630
Who is this?

275
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,259
A headhunter.

276
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,829
He's talking to
all our staff, offering raises,

277
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,099
and giving them ideas.

278
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,170
What?

279
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,009
How could he do that
in someone else's hospital?

280
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,410
So instead of getting distracted,

281
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,109
get rid of people like this
first, okay?

282
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,250
Don't say that.

283
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,450
I had a long day
escorting a VIP myself.

284
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,789
You have a tendency to belittle...

285
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,890
what we administrators do and...

286
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,460
Not again!

287
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,029
Do you think we should be
dividing medical...

288
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,630
and administrative duties?

289
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,259
You know the situation we're in.

290
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,200
That's only because
you always look down on me.

291
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,240
I don't look down on you.

292
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,470
It's because I'm upset.

293
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,240
You're upset? Because of me?

294
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,309
Yes.

295
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,180
We should be supporting each other,

296
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,680
but instead we're taking sides
and that upsets me.

297
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,250
It's so distressing.

298
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,789
Why would you feel upset
and distressed over that?

299
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:38,890
I know.

300
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,329
Even parents and children
and husbands and wives...

301
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,559
all have different opinions.

302
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,730
We're just colleagues,

303
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,869
so why wouldn't we?

304
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,099
But...

305
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,900
still...

306
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,009
we're in the same boat
that's called Doldam.

307
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,380
Aren't we?

308
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,750
Please...

309
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,920
don't speak to me with that gaze.

310
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,420
When you look at me like that,

311
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,990
my heart...

312
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,359
Do that for me, Manager Jang.

313
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,299
She's such a fox.

314
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,009
(Doctor Agency, Im Hyun Joon)

315
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,559
Hey, are you going somewhere?

316
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,890
Yes, home.

317
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,490
I have a sudden appointment
and am leaving an hour early.

318
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,500
I won't be far,

319
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,460
so call me if there's
an emergency, okay?

320
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,730
Can you spare me five minutes
before you leave?

321
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
I have something important to say.

322
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,240
Later. I really can't
afford to be late.

323
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,269
Sorry.

324
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,990
Are you eating flour again?

325
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,589
No. Well, not often.

326
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,690
Rarely, when
an operation ends late.

327
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:01,470
Very rarely, when I'm really hungry.

328
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,970
I have a cup noodle.

329
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,000
A cup noodle?

330
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
My gosh.

331
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,809
You can't eat such things.

332
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,240
I said no instant or junk food.

333
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,480
Your skin will
lose its elasticity...

334
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,779
and get wrinkly in next to no time,
you know.

335
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:18,880
Okay.

336
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,019
I'll be more careful, Madam Jung.

337
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,859
What got into you anyway?

338
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,829
You didn't say anything
on the phone this morning.

339
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,660
Did you and Dad fight?

340
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
What?

341
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,170
Fighting is so undignified.

342
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,430
You really came here
because you missed me?

343
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,900
That too.

344
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,009
Actually,

345
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,509
Eun Ho called me.

346
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,579
He called you?

347
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,279
Why? Is he getting married again?

348
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,849
He has a favor to ask of you.

349
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,819
Did he get out of
the wrong side of his bed?

350
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,450
Why would someone like him
ask me for a favor?

351
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,589
What is it? Does he want to hire me?

352
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,430
Does someone called Seo Woo Jin
work at your hospital?

353
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,069
What?

354
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,569
Has it become a habit?

355
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,240
It's Cha Eun Jae's brother
this time?

356
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,339
You stabbed a senior in the back.

357
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,750
Now you're attacking
a friend's family?

358
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,480
It has nothing to do with you.

359
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,750
Drop it and go your own way.

360
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,849
Don't you live like that, Woo Jin.

361
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,190
You can't blame anyone else...

362
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,660
for your miserable life.

363
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,369
You were born to such parents...

364
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,829
who did that to you.

365
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,069
That's not a reason to...

366
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,000
ruin other people's lives
and make them unhappy.

367
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,410
Who ruined whom?

368
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,480
You ruined my life.

369
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,519
You ruined my life and my family!

370
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,119
But then,

371
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,190
I was the fool for trusting you.

372
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,630
Who can I blame?

373
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:46,200
That's why I grit my teeth
and try to move on.

374
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,369
But...

375
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,339
just to make his son a doctor,

376
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,410
my father worked hard
his whole life.

377
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,410
He invested all his savings
and a small apartment.

378
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,079
into my hospital, but...

379
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,390
Darn.

380
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,619
He even blew that as well.

381
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,829
Because of you.

382
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,059
Because of your selfish ways!

383
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,559
Then you should've done better.

384
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,329
Your father poured in
all his life-savings,

385
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,069
so you should've done right by it.

386
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,400
Why did you accept kickbacks and
abuse treatment on your patients?

387
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,670
Without taking shortcuts,

388
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,539
when would I have
paid back my loans?

389
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,640
There were no other options.

390
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,849
Still, you crossed the line by
letting someone else operate though.

391
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:37,779
You had
a medical device sales rep...

392
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,920
operate on a patient!

393
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,319
That only happened once, you jerk.

394
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,420
As if.

395
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,190
It happened on
at least seven occasions.

396
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,990
One of the patients was a minor
who almost died...

397
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,960
due to excessive loss of blood.

398
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,859
Have you forgotten that?

399
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,130
You said we should make money.

400
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,700
You're the one who wanted
enough money to rule the world.

401
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,109
I never said anything about
breaking the law in the process.

402
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,869
But that's how everyone makes money.

403
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,339
They all break the law
but still rule the world,

404
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,549
so why do you have
to be so self-righteous?

405
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,880
Why wouldn't you let me
be that way too?

406
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,980
Because it's you!

407
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:19,990
Because...

408
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,500
you're the only one who I admired
during medical school.

409
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,940
I passed up on a fellowship
with a university hospital.

410
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,710
Do you really think
it was because of the money,

411
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,380
Hyun Joon?

412
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,420
Still,

413
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,460
you should've let it slide.

414
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:57,829
Why couldn't you have let it slide
just once?

415
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,369
(Men's Changing Room)

416
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,529
Mom, did you meet with Eun Jae?

417
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes, I just got back
from talking to her.

418
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,599
What did she say?

419
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,369
What else can she say?
Of course, she'll help her brother.

420
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,339
It turns out that Dr. Seo
is a close colleague of hers.

421
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,339
She'll talk some sense into him.

422
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,609
I'm sorry.

423
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,309
I was going to call her myself,

424
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,710
but I thought it'd be better
coming from you,

425
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,180
so I asked for a tough favor.

426
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,450
A favor? Those never exist
when it comes to family.

427
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,519
Besides, you know
how much Eun Jae...

428
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,130
cares about her family.

429
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,029
Another surgeon must've...

430
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,470
swept his mistake under the rug.

431
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,900
Talk about being
unprofessional and immoral.

432
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,609
The operating surgeon
was your brother.

433
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,339
There's a limit to how much
we can cover up for each other.

434
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:29,109
Shouldn't doctors cover for
each other when needed?

435
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,480
Besides, this is your brother
we're talking about.

436
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,619
You told me your brother
is also a doctor, right?

437
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,019
Could you put in a good word
to Dr. Seo?

438
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,119
We'll make his silence worthwhile.

439
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,859
This is your brother, Eun Jae.

440
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,019
You're back so soon?

441
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,259
Well, the conversation
didn't last that long.

442
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:48,390
What about you?
Why are you still here?

443
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,529
Aren't you heading home?

444
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,700
I don't know.

445
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:01,799
So...

446
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,480
before I left, you said
you had something to tell me.

447
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,880
It was important...

448
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,319
and you asked for five minutes
of my time.

449
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,690
What is it about?

450
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,339
Tell me what it's about.

451
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,470
Later.

452
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,109
We'll talk some other time, Eun Jae.

453
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:11,269
Unbelievable.

454
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,779
After all those years
you devoted to Doldam,

455
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,680
they kicked you out
with just a single piece of paper.

456
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,089
One single letter of dismissal.

457
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,259
You haven't told Master Kim yet,
have you?

458
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,390
I couldn't.

459
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,759
I'm glad.

460
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,759
Let's not burden him with this news.

461
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,769
Dr. Shim is still there,
so she can cover my workload.

462
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,539
Burden me with what?

463
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,450
Master Kim.

464
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,319
(Termination of Contract)

465
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,490
It was delivered to him
by Dr. Yang Ho Jun.

466
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,029
The lack of respect and courtesy
is infuriating.

467
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,630
This isn't how you treat people,
you know.

468
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,009
Master Kim!

469
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,839
You're right, Mr. Oh.

470
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,880
This isn't how you treat people.

471
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,250
But Master Kim...

472
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,349
If he wishes to fire you,

473
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:29,049
then tell him to do it face to face.

474
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,890
That's the least he can do
when firing a fellow doctor...

475
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,190
who has devoted 30 years of his life
in the medical field.

476
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,960
Don't you agree, Ms. Oh?

477
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,759
Yes, I concur.

478
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,430
President Park made the decision.

479
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,829
Doldam Hospital is an organization,

480
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,369
so what can I do
when the man in charge...

481
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,970
makes up his mind?

482
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,480
I'd rather you not
say that as an excuse.

483
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,119
There is something you can do,
but you can't be bothered to do it.

484
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,789
Dealing with those...

485
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,059
who are insolent and unreasonable...

486
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,359
is a pain in the butt.

487
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,130
It's exhausting to fight back,

488
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,400
so you're avoiding it
all together...

489
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,740
by rationalizing it
with a lame excuse.

490
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
Aren't I right?

491
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,309
Master Kim...

492
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,839
Do you know how many patients...

493
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,250
were rejected and
asked to go elsewhere today?

494
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,450
4 traffic accident victims,
2 patients with fractures,

495
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,650
and someone who attempted suicide.

496
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,190
There was also a patient
having seizures which make eight.

497
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:40,990
One of them...

498
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,859
passed away on the way
to another hospital...

499
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,599
due to excessive bleeding.

500
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,170
Another patient
missed the golden hour...

501
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,069
and is still unconscious.

502
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,769
This is what happens
when we say that our hands are tied.

503
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,269
The more we avoid
doing what's needed,

504
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:01,109
this vicious cycle will never end.

505
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,420
I understand
that it's a tough fight.

506
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,519
I'm just as exhausted.

507
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,590
You want to just quit because
you're fed up with their antics.

508
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,389
That I understand too.

509
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,960
I feel the same way.

510
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,360
But this isn't how you do it.

511
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,699
If you really wish
to step away from this battle,

512
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,440
be yourself
and do it in your own way.

513
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,940
Accepting this letter of dismissal?

514
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:31,170
This isn't right, Dr. Nam.

515
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,159
(Termination of Contract)

516
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,530
What are you doing here?

517
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,099
We never know when
we'll have an incoming patient.

518
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,539
I'm just getting the station ready.

519
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,210
We won't be accepting
outside trauma patients for a while.

520
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,849
How long have you been at Doldam?

521
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,219
It's been a little over a month.

522
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,280
Why?

523
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,820
But still you don't know
how Doldam operates.

524
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,820
What do you mean by that?

525
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,329
You see, tomorrow is Friday.

526
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,909
Will we get our Friday back again?

527
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,090
Of course.
This is Doldam, after all.

528
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,440
Welcome.

529
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,440
Boss.

530
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,190
It's been while, sirs.

531
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,260
I met with you through Woo Jin.

532
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,929
I'm Im Hyun Joon
from Samjin Hospital.

533
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,800
(Doldam Hospital)

534
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,989
How come this hospital
doesn't have any patients?

535
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,929
It's pancreas head cancer.

536
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,800
A laparoscopy will be the way to go.

537
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,539
It seems better to just open him up.

538
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:15,469
Hey, are you not aware...

539
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:18,010
that Dr. Park is a master of
the laparoscopic Whipple procedure?

540
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,840
Dr. Park equals to laparoscopy.

541
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,650
Just memorize it.

542
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,210
So what will Dr. Park do?

543
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,150
A laparoscopy.

544
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,849
The patient will be opened up.

545
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,860
When he came in for a checkup
a month ago,

546
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,989
the cancer that started
in the head of the pancreas...

547
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,929
had only spread to parts
of his duodenum and stomach.

548
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,230
During the month though,

549
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,230
it spread to his
biliary tract and transverse colon.

550
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,500
That's why I'll open him up instead.

551
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,039
- Will you perform a PPPD?
- Of course.

552
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,969
Dr. Yang will cut and remove
the metastasized colon.

553
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,309
Yes, doctor.

554
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,110
And what can I do?

555
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,989
That depends on
the answer you give me.

556
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,090
Did you ask me here
to hear my answer...

557
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:15,300
rather than to let me
participate in the operation then?

558
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,500
Dr. Seo.

559
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,130
You only get this opportunity...

560
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,670
because I acknowledge
your skills as a surgeon.

561
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,269
If you wish to assist me,

562
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,210
you must prove your dignity
as a doctor first.

563
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,980
So covering up
for a fellow doctor...

564
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,150
is considered dignity now?

565
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,820
Dr. Seo.

566
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,059
You said an oath
when graduating from medical school.

567
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,230
"I will do everything
in my power..."

568
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,329
"to maintain the reputation..."

569
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,730
"and the dignified tradition
of the medical field."

570
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,670
"My fellow doctors are
my brothers and sisters."

571
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,039
All you have to do
is stay true to that oath.

572
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,079
It didn't end there though.

573
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,949
"I will perform my duties
upon my conscience and dignity."

574
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,150
"I..."

575
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,019
"will put my patients' health
above anything else."

576
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,929
Is that your answer then?

577
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,599
I'm asking...

578
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,630
if that is your answer.

579
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:31,010
He has until this evening,
so give him that time to think.

580
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,539
I will check on
the patient's condition...

581
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,179
and confirm the surgery later on.

582
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
Does that sound good?

583
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,420
Dr. Seo?

584
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,630
(Mom)

585
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:00,500
That's odd.
Why isn't she answering me?

586
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,039
Maybe she's with a patient.

587
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,840
Has she not been able
to talk to him yet?

588
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,550
Why aren't you answering that?

589
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,119
Isn't it your mother calling?

590
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,920
Are you two on the outs?

591
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,389
Who on earth are you?

592
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,929
I'm Kang Ik Joon.

593
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,260
We already met yesterday.

594
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,730
And what's your name?

595
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:32,969
Cha Eun Jae. You're Eun Jae.

596
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,909
Don't call me that.
It's Dr. Cha to you.

597
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,840
Eun Jae, will you
be participating in my surgery?

598
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,449
No, I specialize
in cardiac surgeries.

599
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,250
I mend hearts and lungs.

600
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,519
No way. You fix hearts?

601
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,550
Can you fix how someone feels too?

602
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,489
- What?
- Can you perhaps fix mine?

603
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,730
You see, it's been
malfunctioning for years.

604
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,030
Sir,

605
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,329
please go back to your room
when I ask nicely.

606
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,500
Let's go out on a date.

607
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,739
You're my type, you know.

608
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,809
I'm rich too.

609
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:15,739
Are you kidding me?

610
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,710
Look. You received a text.

611
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,659
Talk about a peaceful day, right?

612
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,619
Tell me about it.

613
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,190
I don't know
if things should be this quiet.

614
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,570
Hey, no one in Doldam's ER
should say that.

615
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,570
It's supposed to bring by
a set of trauma patients.

616
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,639
You said it's a curse.

617
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,739
But the situation
has changed for us.

618
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,269
Don't you agree, Ms. Uhm?

619
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:44,340
Right.

620
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,699
What's this?

621
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,170
No way.

622
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,440
Do you think it's a prank?

623
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,539
What are you doing?

624
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,409
Didn't you get a text
about the patients?

625
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,650
- Master Kim
- Yes?

626
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,679
What's this?

627
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:27,650
What do you think? It means
we're expecting emergency patients.

628
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,590
What emergency patients?

629
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,320
Don't be too startled.

630
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,289
You kept refusing
to accept patients.

631
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,820
So I created a separate hotline.

632
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,829
- What?
- What?

633
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,230
- Ms. Uhm
- Yes, sir.

634
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,530
The paramedics will call this phone
regarding emergency patients.

635
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,969
I want you to be in charge
of taking their calls.

636
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,000
Okay, sir.

637
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,269
- Eun Jae.
- Yes, I'm right here.

638
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:48,039
A patient with myocardial infarction
had a cardiac arrest,

639
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,809
so get ready for that.

640
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,369
The patient might
have to get surgery,

641
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,579
so call the Department
of Anaesthesiology.

642
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,780
Okay, sir.

643
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,050
Master Kim, we're also expecting
a patient with abdominal pain.

644
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,210
The patient will be here
in five minutes.

645
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,880
Where is Dr. Jung?

646
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,789
- Dr. Jung!
- Yes, I'm right here.

647
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,750
A patient with abdominal pain
will be here in five, so get ready.

648
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,190
Okay, sir. Dr. Yun.

649
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,190
Okay.

650
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,929
Ms. Uhm, just in case,

651
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:12,230
call Dr. Seo and have him
come down here.

652
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,460
Okay.

653
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,900
- Ms. Oh.
- Yes, sir.

654
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,170
Please call Dr. Nam
and ask him to come right away.

655
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,739
I will.

656
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,190
Dr. Nam, this is Oh Myung Sim.

657
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,690
Master Kim wants you here.

658
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,030
Incoming!

659
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,039
Here's the bed. 1, 2, 3.

660
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:58,070
Dr. Yun, please do CPR.

661
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,710
Let's connect the monitor
and check the heart rate.

662
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,280
The monitor is ready.

663
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,119
Here's a doctor's note, EKG,
and a CD.

664
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,150
Okay.

665
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,019
Stop for a moment
so we can check his heart rate.

666
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,219
V-fib.

667
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,429
Charge to 200 joules.

668
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,230
Clear.

669
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,429
Shock.

670
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:24,929
Do another CPR.

671
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,000
I'll take over.

672
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,539
Let's insert a tube.

673
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,469
- Incoming!
- This way!

674
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,079
Let's move the patient.

675
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,179
1, 2, 3.

676
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,960
What... What happened?

677
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,289
He and his friends were
using an air spray gun...

678
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:51,659
to get rid of the dust
on their clothes.

679
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,000
And as a joke,
they sprayed air into his anus.

680
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,800
After that, his abdomen
suddenly expanded...

681
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
which was then followed
by severe abdominal pain.

682
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,739
An air spray gun?

683
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,039
Don't you know?

684
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,239
It's a gun that sprays air
at a high density.

685
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:07,940
I'm sure they made that
for other purposes.

686
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,780
What's wrong with...

687
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,980
It was an air spray gun.

688
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,420
They sprayed it into his anus.

689
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:19,960
Let me check his heart rate.

690
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,130
ROSC.

691
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,170
It's back.

692
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,349
- The patient's heart is beating.
- Okay.

693
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,550
When he arrived at the hospital,

694
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,989
so I had it opened.

695
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,159
But his LAD and LCX
are almost clogged.

696
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,429
Yes, he has thin blood vessels,

697
00:45:58,429 --> 00:45:59,960
and it's severely calcified.

698
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,530
What do you think?

699
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,329
Can you do this?

700
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,900
Yes... What?

701
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,199
Me?

702
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,139
You want me to do this surgery?

703
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,110
Then do you think I should do it?

704
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,179
No, of course not. I should do it.

705
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,380
Instead, I'll assist you.

706
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,650
You?

707
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,719
You don't want that?

708
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,489
No, I'm honored.

709
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,699
Stop smiling. You'll grow on me.

710
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,130
Hurry up and get ready.

711
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,170
Okay, sir.

712
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,440
- Sir.
- Yes?

713
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,769
His abdomen got expanded
due to an air spray gun.

714
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,409
A sonography will be useless
because he has pneumoperitoneum,

715
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,880
but I'm pretty sure
he has bowel rupture.

716
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,179
He needs to get surgery...

717
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,849
as soon as he takes
the pre-surgery tests and CT.

718
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:56,489
I need to treat a CS patient.

719
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,090
Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh.

720
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,760
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

721
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,460
I want you and Mr. Park...

722
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,590
to help operate on a patient
with bowel rupture.

723
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,030
Okay, I'll get ready.

724
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,730
Mr. Park, a patient
with bowel rupture...

725
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,929
will be in OR 2.

726
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:10,969
Okay.

727
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,170
- I'll get ready.
- Okay, hurry.

728
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:15,369
Ms. Oh.

729
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,469
Where is Dr. Nam?

730
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,480
He'll be here. Don't worry.

731
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,110
(Mom)

732
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,159
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

733
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,829
You will be charged after the beep.

734
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,039
What do you mean
the OR isn't available?

735
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,869
The patient had a cardiac arrest,
and he's not in good condition.

736
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,010
And you're telling me...

737
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,780
that you're going to operate a CABG?

738
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,010
Yes, is there a problem with that?

739
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,380
First of all, I don't trust you.

740
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,519
Up until recently,
you used to get nauseous...

741
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,219
and run out of the OR.

742
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,820
I don't do that anymore.

743
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,389
And the patient's condition
is too severe.

744
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,190
What if we operate on him,

745
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,829
and he died on the operating table?

746
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:46,159
We both know what will happen next.

747
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,599
We'll get blamed
for medical malpractice...

748
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,829
and end up getting sued.

749
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:52,599
Why would I willingly go through
all that trouble?

750
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,239
But the patient is dying. Are you
really not going to let me in?

751
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,739
That's right. I won't let you in.
I don't want to be responsible.

752
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,440
I don't think we can save him, okay?

753
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:05,449
Then I'll take over.

754
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,320
Dr. Nam.

755
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,059
I was going to help
with the bowel rupture.

756
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,690
But I'll take over
if you're afraid...

757
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,530
to take a patient
with myocardial infarction.

758
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,090
Didn't you get dismissed?

759
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,130
I don't think it's your place
to interfere with my contract.

760
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,369
You're very rude
and disrespectful...

761
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:28,800
to mess with my privacy like that.

762
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,869
And it's very exhausting
and annoying to deal with you.

763
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:32,869
But I guess I don't have a choice.

764
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,679
A friend of mine told me
it's not time to give up yet.

765
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,550
I'll be in charge of the patient
with myocardial infarction.

766
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,849
Don't worry, Dr. Cha.

767
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,800
Hey, Dr. Shim.

768
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:59,300
Just for your information,
I'm the friend...

769
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,699
who told him not to give up.

770
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,510
And the notice he got
about his contract termination...

771
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,280
I tore it apart.

772
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,679
You can report that...

773
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,579
to President Park.

774
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,670
You've never done a CABG, have you?

775
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,639
No, I've assisted before,
but I was never put in charge.

776
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,710
Concentrate and do your best, okay?

777
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,570
Okay.

778
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,639
May I begin?

779
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,349
Yes, you may begin.

780
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,750
This patient has
a coronary 2-vessel disease.

781
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,579
I will now begin the coronary artery
bypass surgery.

782
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,150
Scalpel.

783
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,460
I will begin the surgery.

784
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,500
Scalpel.

785
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,539
Bovie.

786
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,909
Sternal saw.

787
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:25,789
Sternal retractor.

788
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,900
What will you use for the graft?

789
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,730
I'll use the ITA.

790
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,800
Okay.

791
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,170
Army Navy Retractor.

792
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,869
Forceps and harmonic forceps.

793
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:51,480
Make sure there are enough
soft tissues...

794
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,980
so you can fix
the blood vessel later on.

795
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,679
Okay.

796
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,750
Let me check the injury first.

797
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,150
Kelly forceps.

798
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,420
Bovie.

799
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,030
Shall I pour water?

800
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,530
Yes. Saline, please.

801
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,670
Another bowl.

802
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,610
Here. The rectum's perforated.

803
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:21,940
Suction.

804
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,579
It's as Dr. Shim said.

805
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,050
You said Dr. Seo shines...

806
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,949
most brightly in the OR.

807
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,820
Do I?

808
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,429
It must be because
you're confident in your skills...

809
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:41,530
and don't hesitate to do
what you believe in.

810
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,900
I think the same goes for people.

811
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,300
When you take action...

812
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,139
with confidence that you're right,

813
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,880
people shine.

814
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,010
Ms. Oh.

815
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:59,210
Do what you believe is right.

816
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:02,820
That won't get you
banned from the OR.

817
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:06,719
At least, not at Doldam Hospital.

818
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,670
- What do I do?
- What's wrong?

819
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,380
The graft is damaged.

820
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,780
It's okay. Calm down.

821
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,050
Don't get flustered.

822
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:34,849
The patient is still stable.

823
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:36,519
Eun Jae.

824
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:38,489
Take a deep breath.

825
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:44,059
Now think again what you must do.

826
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,800
Okay. I should...

827
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,630
What other graft is there?

828
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,099
- Another graft?
- Yes.

829
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:54,570
There's the gastroepiploic artery.

830
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,000
That's right.

831
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,670
I'll open the diaphragm...

832
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,139
and take a graft
from the gastroepiploic artery.

833
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,239
Okay.

834
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,340
Scalpel.

835
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,679
- Suction.
- Harmonic forceps.

836
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,860
One vessel loop.

837
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,960
Right angle forceps.

838
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,800
How do you feel?

839
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,800
Don't your hands feel light
now that you're confident?

840
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,340
One more vessel loop.

841
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,449
That's why your own will...

842
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:41,849
is important to
an operating surgeon.

843
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,619
When your will
of wanting to do it...

844
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:46,389
turns into the assurance
that you can do it,

845
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,130
the success rate
of the surgery goes up.

846
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,460
Tie.

847
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,309
- Cut.
- Cut.

848
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:10,380
There are no leaks this time.

849
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,880
You don't need to
check with me all the time.

850
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,780
This is your operation.
Do what you think is right.

851
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,820
Let's continue.

852
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:22,219
Then I'll open the pericardium now.

853
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,130
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Forceps.

854
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,380
Sutures.

855
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,599
- Cut.
- Cut.

856
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:11,639
Sutures.

857
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,010
(OR 1, OR 2)

858
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,480
Wait. Dr. Seo.

859
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,150
A visitor is waiting in
the staff lounge for you.

860
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,510
Ms. Oh.

861
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,309
I told you not to egg on Dr. Seo.

862
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:51,650
I thought I got my message across.

863
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,010
You did.

864
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,420
And I gave you my answer.

865
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,550
That what you're afraid of...

866
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,090
won't happen at Doldam Hospital.

867
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,829
Can you be responsible for
Seo Woo Jin's future?

868
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,500
Do you think that...

869
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:13,000
you can be responsible
for it yourself, Dr. Shim?

870
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,570
What?

871
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,000
All of us...

872
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,039
were sued by a patient or two
in our lifetime.

873
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,980
But we never...

874
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,340
refused a patient
for fear of being sued.

875
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,750
The advice from...

876
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,349
someone who refused to operate
because of the risk?

877
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:30,920
I wonder what help
that would be to Dr. Seo.

878
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,719
I seriously wonder.

879
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:37,860
You people.

880
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,429
Do you know
just how annoying you are?

881
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,900
My goodness. We know.

882
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,940
But that's what Master Kim calls...

883
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,469
being utter show-offs.

884
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,550
Ms. Oh.

885
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,519
- Was the surgery a success?
- Yes.

886
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,449
How about yours?

887
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,590
It went very smoothly.

888
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,889
He gets better every day.

889
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,320
In a style different
from yours, Master Kim.

890
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,960
You mean that even
his operations are good-looking?

891
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,829
How is Dr. Cha?

892
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,099
She's celebrating her first surgery
as the operating surgeon.

893
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,789
Thank you for
hanging in there for me.

894
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:42,460
Thank you.

895
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,219
Mom. What are you doing here?

896
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,719
Eun Jae.

897
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,389
Your surgery just ended?

898
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:17,889
I'm having a chat with Dr. Seo.

899
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,030
Dr. Seo. Can you excuse us?

900
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,000
Eun Jae. What do you think
you're doing?

901
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,409
He's talking with me.

902
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,869
Please. I'd like you to leave.

903
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,150
I'm not done talking yet.

904
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,650
Goodbye.

905
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,880
Wait. Dr. Seo!

906
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,289
Stop it, Mom.

907
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,849
What about your brother, then?

908
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,989
He's agitated
and won't stop calling me.

909
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:52,289
If he's that agitated, tell him to
come and sort it out himself.

910
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,800
Why is he still hiding
behind your back...

911
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,030
and calling at his age?

912
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,530
Eun Jae. Your language
is a bit too rough.

913
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,969
Mom, will you please stop?

914
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,769
This is where I work.

915
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:02,840
I know that.

916
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,170
That's why I came here myself
to politely talk it out.

917
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,880
Do you think you're being polite?

918
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,940
What?

919
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,750
This is wrong, Mom.

920
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:16,349
If Eun Ho did wrong,
he should be scolded.

921
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,719
Why would you
talk to Woo Jin about that?

922
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,659
Why would you talk to him
without even telling me first?

923
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,159
Eun Jae.

924
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:27,199
You did all you wanted so far.

925
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,800
Was that not enough?

926
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,000
My goodness.

927
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,570
What makes you think
I did what I wanted?

928
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,670
You didn't know?

929
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,670
I didn't want to study medicine.

930
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,409
What?

931
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:40,239
You said I had to.

932
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,440
You said it was your dream.

933
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,980
So I studied without
any complaints and got in.

934
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,119
I really didn't want to
become a surgeon.

935
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,119
You said I had to.

936
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,260
You said I had to become
a cardiac surgeon at any cost,

937
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,719
so I got in.

938
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:59,590
I threw up so much
because I got nauseated.

939
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,300
I ran out of the OR so many times.

940
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,829
I tried out so many medications
just to keep going back in.

941
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,800
You don't know.

942
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,909
I dozed off...

943
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:13,170
and dropped to the floor
so many times.

944
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,139
How many times
I got kicked for that.

945
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,050
You don't know.

946
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,519
Because it wasn't you
who carried me...

947
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,949
and ran out of the OR.

948
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,849
What's wrong with you?

949
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,119
It's undignified to
yell at your mother.

950
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,760
This is why I told you
not to eat instant food.

951
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,730
My gosh. Just look at
how rough you've become.

952
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,599
Mom, will you please stop?

953
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,469
This won't do.

954
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,199
Another day here
will just ruin you further.

955
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,940
Once I deal with Dr. Seo,

956
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,369
I'll find you another job.

957
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,309
This is not how I raised you.

958
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,909
How on earth
did you end up like this?

959
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,320
My goodness. Look at those eyes.

960
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:58,719
How dare you look at me like that?

961
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,219
My goodness. I don't believe this.

962
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,360
That's why your own will is
important to an operating surgeon.

963
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,929
Apologize to me right away!

964
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,170
When your will
of wanting to do it...

965
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,199
turns into the assurance
that you can do it,

966
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:15,639
the success rate
of the surgery goes up.

967
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:17,269
Eun Jae!

968
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,780
Tell Eun Ho to sort out
his own mess.

969
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:23,239
What?

970
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:25,480
Don't ask me...

971
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,380
or Woo Jin for that matter
for any favors.

972
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:31,519
This is your operation.

973
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,960
This is my life...

974
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,460
and this is my place of work.

975
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:39,130
Do what you think is right.

976
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,429
Don't humiliate me here...

977
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:44,969
and never come to me
for anything like this again.

978
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:09,960
Are you all right?

979
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:15,099
I'm sorry.

980
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,239
What do I do?

981
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:26,210
I'm too humiliated
to even look at you.

982
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:28,539
So?

983
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:30,769
What's your answer?

984
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:32,210
Tell that doctor...

985
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,780
to explain his actions
to his patient.

986
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,909
He will acknowledge his malpractice
and apologize...

987
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:39,480
for his mistake.

988
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:54,460
The doctor who operated
on your bladder is on his way.

989
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:57,400
He will officially apologize
when he gets here,

990
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,570
but I thought
you should know about...

991
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,500
what happened first.

992
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:10,280
I apologize once again
on his behalf.

993
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,880
I'm sorry.

994
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,619
(ICU)

995
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,699
Did you tell him?

996
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,900
Yes. And you?

997
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:35,239
Me too.

998
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,969
So what did Dr. Park say?

999
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,880
I'm not allowed
in the OR for a while.

1000
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,510
I see.

1001
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,949
You don't seem
worried at all though.

1002
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:54,590
You're right. I wonder why.

1003
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:57,250
Mr. Do, I'm curious though.

1004
01:06:57,989 --> 01:06:58,989
About what?

1005
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:02,289
Why do you keep
making them butt heads?

1006
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,860
If we're being honest,

1007
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:08,760
Doldam can be torn down
the second you give the order.

1008
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,570
So why are you fueling
the fire instead?

1009
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:15,340
I should get going.
We'll talk some other time.

1010
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,639
Hasn't Chairman Shin
been in contact yet?

1011
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:26,010
Yes, I put in a word three times...

1012
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,280
that you wish to speak with him,
but...

1013
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,019
Let me try again.

1014
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,690
What could he possibly be after?

1015
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:59,949
It's been a while, Master Kim.

1016
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,030
You didn't know your car was towed
until today?

1017
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:13,760
You know how busy I've been.

1018
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,770
Ever since that day I was injured,
I haven't had a chance to breathe.

1019
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:20,369
On top of that,
my mom came by yesterday.

1020
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,369
This will cost a small fortune.

1021
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:27,340
Things are tighter now that
my mom cut off my credit card.

1022
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,109
Stay here. I'll go and pay up.

1023
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,979
This much for a towed car?

1024
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:06,109
You should've picked it up sooner.

1025
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,479
What did you expect
when it has been here for days?

1026
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:10,989
Darn it.

1027
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,489
Can you believe it?

1028
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,630
They just dragged it away
and then charged me with...

1029
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,430
Gosh, look at all these zeroes.

1030
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,010
Woo Jin?

1031
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:35,840
Where did he go?

1032
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,609
Seo Woo Jin?

1033
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,619
Woo Jin?

1034
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:46,689
Where are you?

1035
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,590
Woo Jin?

1036
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,390
Seo Woo Jin!
