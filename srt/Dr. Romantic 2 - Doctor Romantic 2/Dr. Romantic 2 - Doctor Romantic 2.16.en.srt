1
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,679
(Final episode)

2
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,460
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

3
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,289
What? Well...

4
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,229
Am I invading your privacy?

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,400
All right then. Forget that I asked.

6
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,109
It was Dr. Do In Beom.

7
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,019
He's a cousin from my mother's side.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,849
His mom is my aunt.

9
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,500
President Yeo.

10
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,169
Sir...

11
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,909
He's fighting the ventilator, which
is what's setting off the alarm.

12
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,110
Let me wean him off the machine.

13
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,110
(Weaning: the decrease
of ventilator support)

14
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,280
- Ms. Oh.
- Yes?

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Please give him an ampul
of dexamethasone.

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,150
Yes, Master Kim.

17
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,759
President Yeo,
I'll now remove the tube.

18
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,360
Suction.

19
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,840
All right. I'll now extubate.

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
(Extubate:
to remove an inserted tube)

21
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,770
Syringe.

22
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:53,580
President Yeo,

23
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,050
go ahead and take
a deep breath for me.

24
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,280
Slowly inhale.

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,159
Now exhale.

26
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,800
How do you feel?

27
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,229
How's your breathing?

28
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,740
Good.

29
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,610
Thank goodness.

30
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,449
I'm truly sorry, sir.

31
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,120
I did not...

32
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,460
keep the promise I made to you.

33
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,470
I was wondering
if something had happened, you know.

34
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,199
I reached out to Chairwoman Shin
numerous times,

35
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,209
but she didn't once answer me back.

36
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,480
Things have been hectic
with his inheritance issue.

37
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,449
Most of it has been sorted out now,
so I'm sure...

38
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,879
she'll address your request
as soon as she's back in office.

39
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,550
I hear you visited
Doldam Hospital recently.

40
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,389
How did you know?

41
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,360
I doubt Master Kim told you.

42
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,399
There are a few people there
who act as my eyes...

43
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,800
and ears.

44
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,699
It seems like...

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,740
Master Kim is still
getting on your nerves.

46
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,569
Nonsense.

47
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,879
I only want an inspection
of Doldam Hospital's operations.

48
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,550
Now that Chairman Shin Myung Ho
has passed away,

49
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,850
Boo Yong Joo is a kite
flying without strings.

50
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,759
He's no longer a match for me.

51
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,029
Actually, he's a match for you.

52
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,959
His strings...

53
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,629
are still well attached.

54
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,610
Oddball Project?

55
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,250
It's a funny name for a project.
What's it about?

56
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,879
Master Kim gave me homework.

57
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,879
Homework?

58
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,730
Mun Jung's father stopped by.

59
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,529
You should've seen the way
they stared at each other.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,399
Do they not have
a close relationship?

61
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,370
Isn't that none of your business?

62
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,009
Mun Jung's the type of person
who gets along with everyone.

63
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,110
He's like a perfectly round stone.

64
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,949
He's sweet, considerate,
generous, and gentle.

65
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,490
I had a major crush on him
in medical school.

66
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,860
I even joined the Bone Club...

67
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,120
just to catch extra glimpses of him.

68
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,490
Is that so?

69
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,360
This one time,

70
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,800
after hearing how
he only drank espressos,

71
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,970
I forced myself to drink them too.

72
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,670
They were so bitter...

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,040
that I avoid them
like the plague now. Funny, right?

74
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,680
Why are you looking at me like that?

75
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,250
I hate it, you know.

76
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,519
- Hate what?
- Black coffee.

77
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
I thought you should know.

78
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,899
So is this where
you've been hiding out?

79
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,069
I wasn't hiding.

80
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,399
I just didn't keep in touch.

81
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,399
Are you...

82
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,870
still miserable
because of your divorce?

83
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,839
Only you...

84
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,209
bring misery into my life.

85
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,149
You know that.

86
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,759
A year of this is more than enough.

87
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,560
Stop being so stubborn
and come back home.

88
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,759
I don't intend to leave
any time soon.

89
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,790
Don't get your hopes up.

90
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,769
You put yourself
through medical school...

91
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,230
just to end up at a tacky hospital?

92
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,439
My life carries more meaning here...

93
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,240
compared to when
I was an object of your bragging.

94
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,189
You're still here.
I heard your father came by.

95
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, he can't stay long.

96
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:21,910
Are you...

97
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,480
Dr. Seo Woo Jin?

98
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,250
Yes, I am.

99
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,320
We should live our lives
by lending others what we have,

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,850
not borrowing what we don't have.

101
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,659
You're still young, so don't follow
your old man's footsteps.

102
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,429
Sorry?

103
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,159
Just know that you owe my son...

104
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,230
big time.

105
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,970
That's enough!

106
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,750
What is he talking about?

107
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,690
I don't get it.
He said he only drank black coffee.

108
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,360
Why did he have to lie about it?

109
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you want it first?

110
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,710
No, I only drink black coffee.

111
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,809
You forgot your coffee.

112
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,110
I pressed the wrong button.

113
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,740
You have it instead.

114
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,789
Wait. Was it so that
I could drink it first?

115
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,730
No way. I highly doubt that.

116
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,059
You're being silly.

117
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,470
(Dr. Oh)

118
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Eun Jae, it's been a while.
How have you been?

119
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,409
Extremely well, sir. What about you?

120
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,610
I'm busy with work, of course.

121
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,620
It's why I called.
You should return to Geodae.

122
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,649
- Sorry?
- I heard you overcame your nausea.

123
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,019
Master Kim already called me.

124
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,460
He did?

125
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,059
To be honest, I gave up on you...

126
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,299
as a surgeon,

127
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,429
but Master Kim sure does wonders.

128
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,899
I can't believe
he fixed your condition.

129
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,139
Why did Master Kim tell Dr. Oh?

130
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,110
How do you know the name
of that loan shark company?

131
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,649
The man you met...

132
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,950
is the one in charge.

133
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,230
But you introduced him
as your father.

134
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,330
That's right. He's my father.

135
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,299
He's the dark shadow
of Myeong-dong...

136
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,299
and the president of
the loan shark company...

137
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,370
that your father
borrowed money from.

138
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,309
Why...

139
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,779
do things like this...

140
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,679
keep happening?

141
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,820
Anyway,
you're expected back next week.

142
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,019
I'll let Master Kim know myself.
Got it?

143
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,759
Why won't life...

144
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,559
just let us be?

145
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,539
(Chapter 16: Koi's Law)

146
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,279
Good morning.

147
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,820
Ms. Jung,
tardiness isn't appreciated.

148
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,269
Ms. Joo.

149
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,039
What's going on
between Dr. Yun and Mr. Park?

150
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,450
See? I was right.

151
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Right about what?

152
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,019
She's been two-timing him.

153
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,149
Mr. Park must've found out.

154
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,730
She's approaching him!

155
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,929
Mr. Park?

156
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes, Dr. Yun.

157
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,830
Are you good?

158
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:45,669
What do you mean?

159
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,169
Well, there's President Yeo...

160
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,179
He's conscious which is a good sign.

161
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,710
Right.

162
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,720
What about us then?

163
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,759
Are we good?

164
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,919
President Yeo.

165
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,220
How are you feeling?

166
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,259
What...

167
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,860
are all these things?

168
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,299
TPN, dopamine, dobutamine,

169
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,200
mucolytics, and antibiotics.

170
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,169
That's...

171
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,279
a lot you're giving me.

172
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,649
It's time...

173
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,889
you took me off them.

174
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,820
But sir...

175
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,360
We live the life we're given...

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
and die as we are supposed to.

177
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,809
Just like you honored
my beating heart,

178
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,379
please honor...

179
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,750
my wish to die on my own terms.

180
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,559
Dr. Park?

181
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,519
(Letter of Resignation)

182
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes?

183
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,159
Chairman Do.

184
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,830
You're here.

185
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,870
I'm here to see Dr. Park.

186
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,970
He hasn't come in yet, sir.

187
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,840
Please have a seat...

188
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,169
and I'll call Dr. Park.

189
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,690
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

190
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,230
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

191
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,429
You can't reach him?

192
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,100
He didn't come to work today...

193
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,529
and his phone has been turned off.

194
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,970
I found this on his desk.

195
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,070
(Letter of Resignation)

196
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,710
President Yeo wanted what?

197
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,279
An honorable death?

198
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,649
Yes.

199
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,279
That's what he told Master Kim.

200
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,549
Is Master Kim
seriously considering this?

201
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,789
If that's what
President Yeo truly wants,

202
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,460
then we have no choice
but to honor his wishes.

203
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,029
Come in.

204
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,579
What brings you by?

205
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,950
Actually,

206
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,589
I received a call
from Dr. Oh last night.

207
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,160
He requested me back at Geodae.

208
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,460
Good for you.

209
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,099
Is it?

210
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,200
You always wanted to go back there,

211
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,740
so I'm guessing it is.

212
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,640
Do you not need me here?

213
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,779
I mean, I believe
I proved myself worthy.

214
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,779
Didn't I?

215
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,460
Are you hoping...

216
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,960
that I tell you to stay? No.

217
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,529
That will never happen.

218
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,730
Is it because
you don't need me here?

219
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,740
This decision
will define your medical career...

220
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,509
and my opinion
shouldn't get in the way of it.

221
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,539
You could still
offer me some advice.

222
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,180
Have a seat.

223
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,990
Well,

224
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,960
let's say you stayed here.

225
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,930
You'll be in for a tough time...

226
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,670
and might be forced
to sacrifice your dream.

227
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,210
The stream of patients...

228
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,509
will have you running
to the OR all the time...

229
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,740
and the constant
flood of patients...

230
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,549
might suck the life out of you.

231
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,619
However,

232
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,589
it's a job that must be done.

233
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:14,890
The burden of responsibility...

234
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,859
could crumble you,

235
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,029
but the patients you save daily...

236
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:28,539
will help feed your pride
as a doctor.

237
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,849
Now, let's consider your life
back at Geodae.

238
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,880
What if I head back there?

239
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,920
You'll have the opportunity
to build a career...

240
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,420
at a much nicer facility...

241
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,329
with a generous amount
in research funding.

242
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,529
You'll also be able to build
more meaningful connections...

243
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,529
which will lead you
to many more opportunities...

244
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,140
down the road.

245
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,269
The experience you gain
and the talent you show...

246
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,009
will be compensated monetarily.

247
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,480
Still, Master Kim...

248
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,089
Which path will lead you
to be a better doctor?

249
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,559
Which could benefit your life more?

250
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,390
Don't turn to me for advice...

251
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,230
on what will lead
to a more meaningful life...

252
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,269
because that's a question
I could never answer.

253
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,200
One's life?

254
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,380
It's never about
comparing yours with that of others.

255
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,119
It's about the choice you make.

256
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,990
What I know for sure...

257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,359
is that you'll thrive
wherever you are.

258
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,900
No matter which path you take
or which choice you make,

259
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,309
don't doubt yourself anymore.

260
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,079
Got it?

261
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,329
Dr. Seo.

262
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,559
Dr. Seo.

263
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:37,369
Dr. Seo!

264
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,170
Do you have something to say to me?

265
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,980
We should at least talk.

266
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,140
I'm sorry,

267
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,380
but I haven't wrapped
my mind around this yet.

268
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,750
I'm furious,

269
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,819
but I don't know
who to point that anger at.

270
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,960
To consider it a done deal...

271
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,359
and forget about our parents' deal?

272
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,259
Well, I'm in too much
dismay for that.

273
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,230
But still,

274
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,869
none of this is your fault.

275
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,609
Will it help...

276
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,420
if I leave this hospital?

277
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,490
I'm used to this situation by now
anyway.

278
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,690
I lost my friends this way...

279
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,000
and even those I love and care for.

280
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,200
This is where I came...

281
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,670
to avoid any more heartbreaks,

282
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,569
but...

283
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,579
life sure works in mysterious ways.

284
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,200
What's up with you?

285
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,299
Did Master Kim scold you?

286
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,180
Actually, Woo Jin...

287
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,640
What is it?

288
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,279
I'm being called back.

289
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,450
Dr. Oh requested me back at Geodae.

290
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,660
When?

291
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,160
Next week.

292
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,970
Good for you.

293
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,869
Congratulations.

294
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,299
Please give Dr. Park another chance.

295
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:30,710
If you do, I'll make sure
it's worth it.

296
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,109
What's your name, doctor?

297
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,150
It's Yang Ho Jun.

298
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,319
I worked under Dr. Park
for 10 years...

299
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,519
and I'm ready to do
anything for him.

300
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,559
I await your orders.

301
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,990
You tell me then.

302
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,569
How far are you willing to go
for Dr. Park?

303
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,880
(Letter of Resignation)

304
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,279
(Park Min Guk)

305
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,660
I wonder if Dr. Seo
made any progress on his homework.

306
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,730
Beats me.

307
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,029
I bet he's struggling though.

308
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,099
It's not the easiest diagnosis
for a second-year fellow to make.

309
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,440
Do you know what...

310
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,910
Master Kim is suffering from?

311
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,380
I'm heading out.

312
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,809
That must mean he knows something.

313
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,009
Hold up.

314
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,150
Dr. Bae!

315
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,150
Hey, wait.

316
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,029
Woo Jin, did you hear the news?

317
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,299
Eun Jae was requested
back at Geodae.

318
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,769
Yes, I know.

319
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,569
We were talking about
a farewell party.

320
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,609
Right. Ms. Uhm, you can be
in charge of organizing it.

321
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,180
Sure thing.

322
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,710
Can we have it
somewhere other than On Your Way?

323
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,910
Like I said, there's no place
like On Your Way.

324
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,279
And like I said,
that place is getting old.

325
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,289
Tell me about the patient.

326
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,589
He has acute appendicitis.

327
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,230
A portion of his lungs
was cut off before,

328
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,130
probably from
a left lower lobectomy.

329
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,160
Is that effusion I see?

330
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,200
He seems fine to me.

331
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,700
After a lobectomy,
early onset pneumonia...

332
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,640
can be misread as reactive fluid.

333
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,369
This patient seems fine though.

334
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,109
Really? Okay, thanks.

335
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:51,250
- Anything else?
- No, I'm good.

336
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,319
Fine then.

337
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,490
Sure.

338
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,710
What's with those two?

339
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,869
Beats me.

340
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,710
Is it already over between them?

341
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,779
- What?
- What?

342
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,009
Were they seeing each other?

343
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,279
Weren't they? That's what I assumed.

344
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,170
Even when a neighbor's dog
leaves for another home,

345
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,500
he would jerk more tears.

346
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,099
It's not just anyone
but me who's leaving.

347
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,940
How can he not care?

348
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,569
Can you believe it?

349
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,880
She's required to be back
at Geodae next week...

350
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,849
but she just dropped
that bombshell on me...

351
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,849
without even asking
how I feel first?

352
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,450
Him asking me to stay
won't change my decision but...

353
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,650
It's not like...

354
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,789
I'd ask her to stay
or anything but...

355
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,690
Still, this isn't something
he should brush off either.

356
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,500
Still, couldn't she have been
more considerate?

357
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,130
Please say something.

358
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:22,440
Oh, right. I was getting a grip
on the situation.

359
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,980
I thought you were furious with me,

360
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,079
but you barged in here...

361
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,750
to confide in me.

362
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,980
Am I making you uncomfortable?

363
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,519
No, of course not. I'm good.

364
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,319
I mean, if you're comfortable,
then I am too.

365
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,529
Mun Jung.

366
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,670
Why did you want
to escape your father?

367
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,869
Didn't I tell you about
how I got divorced...

368
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,569
a month into my marriage?

369
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,940
You didn't.

370
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,609
She was the daughter
of an assemblyman...

371
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,279
whom my father sponsored.

372
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:07,549
Apparently, she married me
for my father's money.

373
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,250
My father believed he could
buy everything with money...

374
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,319
and he even bought himself
a daughter-in-law.

375
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,390
She was someone I truly fell for.

376
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:23,200
I no longer wanted to be his puppet.

377
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,799
It seems like...

378
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,710
you had a crappy life too.

379
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,609
It doesn't compare to yours though.

380
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,089
What do I do about Eun Jae?

381
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,660
Just tell him how you feel.

382
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,019
How can I?

383
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,630
We're colleagues who work
at the same hospital.

384
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,299
Who will deal with the aftermath
if we break up?

385
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,170
Isn't it silly to worry about
breaking up...

386
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,430
when you haven't
even started to date?

387
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,599
I don't think I can
hold a successful relationship...

388
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,539
while being
the best doctor I can be.

389
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,700
Then be less perfect in both fields.

390
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,440
Why stress out about
being the best all the time?

391
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,740
I envy you.

392
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,710
You always have
an easy view on life.

393
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,980
Hasn't it occurred to you
that you overthink everything?

394
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,250
You have Dr. Seo, you're
a specialist, and you're tall.

395
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,589
From where I stand,
you have everything.

396
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
She's right.

397
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,230
Why do I overthink
and complicate everything?

398
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,480
Are you heading home?

399
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,349
Yes, I'm heading home.

400
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,569
Actually,
I want to ask you something.

401
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,369
What is it?

402
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,869
Why haven't you asked me to stay?

403
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,279
Do I not...

404
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,619
mean anything to you anymore?

405
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,690
I'm scared.

406
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,630
I didn't want to cross the line...

407
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,859
and lose you too.

408
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,769
You idiot.

409
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,269
I'm the one
who just crossed that line.

410
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,140
Didn't you notice?

411
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,019
But you wanted
to go back to Geodae.

412
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,049
That's why you won't ask me to stay?

413
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,990
What if you regret this decision?

414
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,460
Well...

415
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,190
Then I'll do that thing
you taught me.

416
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,859
What I taught you?

417
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,970
Reset.

418
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,690
Sorry about that.

419
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,519
I shouldn't have
ambushed you like that.

420
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:38,930
I'm normally a fast learner but...

421
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,170
(Doctor's Office)

422
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,440
Dr. Bae.

423
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,509
Are you going home?

424
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,049
Yes, Dr. Yang.
You're here until late.

425
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,619
Well, yes.
Dr. Park didn't come to work,

426
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,619
so I should be here instead.

427
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,990
By the way, does Master Kim
have another illness...

428
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,690
other than CTS?

429
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,400
What do you mean?

430
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,369
It's just that I heard
a rumor about it.

431
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,970
I'm not sure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

432
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh, really?

433
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:57,339
I see.

434
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,809
Okay then.

435
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:01,680
I'll see you.

436
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,050
Starting today,

437
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,949
we're going to respect
President Yeo's decision...

438
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,659
and stop giving him
life-prolonging treatment.

439
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,030
Those who wish...

440
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,739
to say goodbye to him...

441
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,570
for the very last time,

442
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,070
you may do so.

443
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,849
Master Kim sounded
a lot calmer than expected...

444
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,719
as he announced the last farewell.

445
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,659
And...

446
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,730
our last goodbyes...

447
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,769
weren't as serious
as I thought they'd be.

448
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:08,840
If I fail to pass my board exam,

449
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,070
will I be able to work here
at Doldam Hospital?

450
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,150
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

451
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,179
What do you think?

452
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,719
I think she's worried for nothing.

453
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,949
That's enough.
Just make sure you pass.

454
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,929
People who are smart
tend to worry all the time.

455
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:31,730
I really hope you're right, Ms. Joo.

456
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,650
Ms. Uhm.

457
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,190
I'm sorry.
I really didn't want to cry.

458
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,690
Don't cry.

459
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:07,559
It's sad that we have
to say goodbye.

460
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,530
But in a way,

461
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,639
dying...

462
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,880
might not be as sad as we think.

463
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,929
Sir, would you like to hear me sing?

464
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,800
Ah Reum, I don't think
that's necessary.

465
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,829
I don't think you're that good.

466
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,840
Will you do me the honor
and sing for me, Dr. Yun?

467
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,079
Okay. I'll sing my favorite
children's song for you.

468
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,340
Why are you going to sing
a children's song?

469
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,849
It can bloom wherever

470
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,860
It can bloom without a name

471
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,530
It can bloom however it wants

472
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,469
In the end, they're all flowers

473
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,809
It's a flower
even if it blooms in the mountains

474
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,179
It's a flower
even if it blooms in the garden

475
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,349
It's a flower
even if it blooms out in the street

476
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:34,880
In the end, they're all flowers

477
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,360
It can bloom wherever

478
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,860
It can bloom however it wants

479
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:50,769
It can bloom without a name

480
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,539
In the end, they're all flowers

481
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,250
Come in.

482
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,190
Master Kim.

483
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,889
President Yeo is waiting.

484
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,099
Okay.

485
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,639
Let's go.

486
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,159
Ms. Oh, please mix 100ml
of pathidine...

487
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,699
into his IV bag.

488
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Okay.

489
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,309
Let's remove the TPN,

490
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,050
dopamine, and dobutamine.

491
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,780
Okay.

492
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,500
I'll do it.

493
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,730
President Yeo.

494
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,440
We got rid of everything
that's been keeping you alive.

495
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,909
There's nothing more we can do.

496
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,019
Thank you.

497
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:00,590
I'm sorry we have to say
goodbye like this.

498
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,489
But personally,

499
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,059
this is a very grateful...

500
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:11,599
and blissful way to say goodbye.

501
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,679
I wish you...

502
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,179
all the best.

503
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,039
And Master Kim.

504
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,469
Yes, go ahead.

505
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,780
I hope you succeed...

506
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,619
in establishing a trauma center.

507
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,460
Okay.

508
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,690
I promise...

509
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,030
that I'll make it happen.

510
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,980
I'll see you again, sir.

511
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,929
Any type of farewell...

512
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,099
leaves a scar on people's hearts.

513
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,110
People normally feel pain,

514
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:08,880
hurt,

515
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,650
sad,

516
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:19,460
or lonely.

517
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,889
So I don't want...

518
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,699
to have to say goodbye
to anyone anymore.

519
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,570
(We think of our patients
like family.)

520
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,269
But...

521
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,789
Do you need something?

522
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,829
I brought the answer...

523
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,300
to the homework you gave me.

524
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,289
(Oddball Project)

525
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,760
What should I do?

526
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,260
I can't find any hints.

527
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,530
Why don't you
narrow things down first?

528
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,659
How?

529
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,269
Don't you remember
what Master Kim said?

530
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:41,099
I don't think it requires
a general surgeon's opinion.

531
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,239
Let's get rid of General Surgery.

532
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,750
His other symptoms have nothing
to do with Orthopedics,

533
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,750
so let's get rid of it as well.

534
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,579
What about Cardiac Surgery?

535
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,989
I don't think it has anything to do
with cardiology either...

536
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,519
based on the symptoms he told me.

537
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,360
Then let's get rid of it as well.

538
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
The only one that's left is...

539
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,199
(Oddball Project)

540
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,360
The only one that's left
is emergency medicine.

541
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,230
Then among all our emergency cases,

542
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,869
we just need to find the ones
that didn't require trauma surgery.

543
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,840
I started adding medical cases...

544
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,039
to the project about two years ago.

545
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,610
But Dr. Yoon gathered most
of the cases and organized them.

546
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:27,449
Is there anyone who knows about
this project as well as Dr. Yoon?

547
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,489
Yes, I participated in the project
from the very beginning.

548
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:32,719
But why do you ask?

549
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,920
Master Kim gave him some homework.

550
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,889
And he won't receive surgery
for his CTS...

551
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,829
until Dr. Seo finds the answer.

552
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,099
Tell me the symptoms.
I'll help you find what it is.

(The diagnosis

556
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,059
You're my doctor, so you can
discuss things with Orthopedics...

557
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,699
and fix a date for my surgery.

558
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,530
Okay?

559
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,440
Okay.

560
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,320
This spot right here has...

561
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,889
the best view of the lake.

562
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,630
I was always so busy...

563
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,000
that I never made time
to see this beautiful view.

564
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,670
Why did you want to see me?

565
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,480
Today, I'm getting CTS surgery
on my right wrist.

566
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,550
And?

567
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,380
For about three weeks
after the surgery,

568
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:45,449
I won't be able to perform
any surgeries in the OR.

569
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,690
And?

570
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,960
During that time,

571
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,559
I'd like you to take my place...

572
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,900
and operate instead.

573
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,329
I don't understand.

574
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,400
Why are you asking me to do that?

575
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,409
You're still the president
of Doldam Hospital.

576
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,280
I'm sorry, but I already resigned.

577
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,349
So this has nothing to do with me.

578
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,820
Ask someone else.

579
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,860
Are you running away again?

580
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:27,099
If you keep running away like that,

581
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:30,900
you'll never be able
to escape from anything.

582
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,409
You must've gotten used
to acting like a mentor...

583
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,510
and leader among a bunch of losers.

584
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,809
Look at you
trying to lecture me as well.

585
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,019
I don't appreciate
how you think I'm no different...

586
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,349
from those losers.

587
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,519
They're not losers.

588
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,860
They're just people with scars.

589
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:00,300
And everyone, including both of us,

590
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,829
has their own scars.

591
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,340
It's for just three weeks.

592
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,210
I'm not asking you
to do this for anyone.

593
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,579
At least consider doing it
as a fellow doctor.

594
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,900
Dr. Park.

595
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,170
You're here.

596
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,769
I couldn't get a hold of you,
and you didn't even come to work.

597
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,170
You have no idea
how worried I've been.

598
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,269
Did you take my resignation letter?

599
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,940
Yes.

600
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,179
Bring it back.

601
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,650
I threw it away.

602
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,420
Who told you to do such a thing?

603
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,849
I'm sorry.

604
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,519
But you can't just
resign like that...

605
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,519
without even telling me.

606
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,889
Do you have any idea...

607
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:07,599
how much time and effort
I invested in you?

608
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,929
- What?
- Listen.

609
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,469
I bet everything on you, sir.

610
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,670
So you can't just give up like this.

611
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,110
You can't give up at a hospital
in the countryside...

612
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,809
just because of an absurd doctor.

613
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,780
Listen to me, Dr. Yang.

614
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,380
I won't acknowledge...

615
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,150
your resignation letter.

616
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,789
Up until now,
you always did everything your way.

617
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:32,650
You made decisions
based on what you wanted to do.

618
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,090
But I won't let you do that...

619
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,989
with your resignation letter.

620
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,300
Do you understand?

621
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,429
You're being pathetic.

622
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,429
You can call me pathetic.

623
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:47,039
You can call me an idiot.

624
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,500
And you can call me a jerk.

625
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:54,039
All I'm asking you to do is
to stay where you belong.

626
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:55,780
Are you crazy?

627
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,510
When you decided to come down here,

628
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,880
I followed you
without a single complaint.

629
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:04,750
I kept you company when you wanted
to drink, drove you home,

630
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:07,889
and did all sorts
of other stuff for you.

631
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,030
I never once complained.

632
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,030
Do you know why?

633
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:17,530
It's because I wanted to succeed.

634
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,570
Okay?

635
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:25,340
I wanted to be on your side
because you're famous and competent.

636
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,210
I wanted to be among the successful.

637
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,050
But if you just give up like this,

638
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,079
what am I supposed to do?

639
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,360
Your life will be completely fine.

640
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,090
But what about me?

641
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,800
You can still go back
to the main hospital.

642
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,400
I'll make sure they take you back.

643
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,239
I don't mind being a minion.

644
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,510
But I don't want to be a loser.

645
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,780
I've been loyal to you
for the past 10 years.

646
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,820
So it's time for you
to take responsibility.

647
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,949
Don't run away and stay.

648
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,659
Stay there and take responsibility
for my past 10 years.

649
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,550
Okay then. Let's get going.

650
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:47,590
You didn't have to wait here.

651
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,590
Okay, let's go.

652
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,969
What are you all doing here?

653
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:11,280
Thank you all in advance
for everything.

654
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,920
- Let's go.
- Master Kim.

655
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:21,489
They're here to greet you as well.

656
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:43,449
My goodness, Mr. Koo.

657
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
Now,

658
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,730
I'm going to ask you
one last question.

659
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,800
Why did you give me this homework?

660
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,170
You told me that you need
competence and luck.

661
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:09,800
You're right. It's important
for surgeons like us...

662
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,739
to have competence and luck.

663
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:18,349
But in order to have
that much competence and luck,

664
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,920
you also need to put in
a lot of effort...

665
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:24,489
and go through tons of experience.

666
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:28,860
That file consists...

667
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:31,929
of all the cases of trauma surgery
that I've performed...

668
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,760
and the emergency treatments
that I've given...

669
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,530
ever since the moment I came
to Doldam Hospital.

670
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,639
The surgeons that took part
in the project...

671
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,309
went over each medical case
over and over again...

672
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,039
from at least five
to dozens of times at most.

673
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,010
We tried so many
different simulations.

674
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,349
There are times when we succeeded.

675
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,650
And there are times when we failed.

676
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,960
But we always searched
for the best method possible...

677
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,489
and tried to find a way
to minimize the damage...

678
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,300
for all our patients.

679
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,369
Incoming!

680
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,869
The intercostal vessel.

681
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:17,969
The reason I was able to find
the pneumothorax...

682
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:20,010
and the intercostal vessel...

683
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:24,079
wasn't because I was
merely competent and lucky.

684
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,090
There's only one way to decrease
your chance of making mistakes.

685
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,119
It's to have
a lot of firsthand experience.

686
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,230
So we're gathering
all our medical cases...

687
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,230
to create a new protocol.

688
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,769
And that's what
the Oddball Project is all about.

689
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,510
I'm sure it took you a long time
to gather all this information.

690
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,079
So why did you share it with me?

691
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:03,519
Because you're also
one of the oddballs.

692
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,820
Does that...

693
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,329
answer your question?

694
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,510
Senn retractor.

695
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,409
One more.

696
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,750
Ms. Joo, focus the light, please.

697
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,780
Okay.

698
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:41,820
How is it, Dr. Bae?

699
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,329
Self-retaining retractor.

700
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,739
There. We see the transverse
carpal ligament.

701
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,010
(Transverse carpal ligament:
Near the wrist on the palm side.)

702
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:01,179
It's badly inflamed.

703
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,440
It is.

704
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,579
And he did all the surgery
in this condition.

705
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,250
Now we just have to take out
the tenosynovium.

706
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,320
(President Park Min Guk)

707
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,860
(Letter of Resignation)

708
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,869
We'll move the patient. 1, 2, 3!

709
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,269
We'll remove the flap. 1, 2, 3.

710
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,869
Sir, do you have
any chronic illnesses?

711
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,670
Were you diagnosed
or are you taking any medications?

712
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,010
No, not at all.

713
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,179
But my stomach hurts so bad.

714
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:12,550
Vitals?

715
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,719
120 over 70, 110bpm.

716
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,250
I'll press your stomach.

717
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,250
This is the liver.

718
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,989
Set up an IV line and
run the operation laboratory tests.

719
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:23,360
Give him nasal oxygen.

720
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,860
A dose of tramadol as well.

721
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,929
Yes, doctor.

722
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,599
Once the IV's in,
we'll do CTs and X-rays.

723
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:30,329
- Dr. Yun.
- Yes?

724
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:31,429
I'll give the orders.

725
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:33,199
Before the CT, check the FAST.

726
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,340
Yes, doctor.

727
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,539
Sir, I'll check with
an ultrasound first.

728
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,579
What?

729
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,349
What's this?

730
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,360
Go ahead. They're almost done here.

731
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:58,730
Okay.

732
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:06,329
(Professor Oh)

733
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,670
Yes, professor.

734
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,539
What? Situs inversus?

735
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,880
Where the organs are reversed?

736
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,179
I think all his organs are reversed.

737
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:22,449
That makes it
situs inversus totalis.

738
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,480
Have you seen it before?

739
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,719
No. I read about it but
I've never seen a case before.

740
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,219
The contrast medium's leaking.

741
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:31,630
I think a mesentery vessel ruptured.

742
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:34,300
I don't think the spleen
tore due to trauma.

743
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,170
It looks like he has
multiple spleens.

744
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:41,599
Situs inversus is caused
by malrotation.

745
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,110
Some malrotation patients
have multiple spleens.

746
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,710
(Malrotation: When
fetal organs fail to rotate.)

747
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,679
He needs surgery. What should we do?

748
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,880
Master Kim's unavailable.

749
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,000
Dr. Park. Just a moment.

750
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,340
We have a traffic accident victim.

751
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,210
He has situs inversus.

752
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,710
Situs inversus totalis...

753
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,079
and multiple spleens.

754
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:31,489
He requires surgery
for abdominal bleeding,

755
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,889
but I've never done it before.

756
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:36,820
Please help.

757
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,400
Are you running away again?

758
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,239
If you keep running away like that,

759
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,869
you'll never be able
to escape from anything.

760
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,110
I'm not asking you
to do this for anyone.

761
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,980
At least consider doing it
as a fellow doctor.

762
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,579
Dr. Park.

763
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:12,559
- Where's the patient?
- In the hybrid room.

764
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,269
How is he?

765
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,510
FAST.

766
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,969
Boo Yong Joo, this fool.

767
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,070
He kept this a secret?

768
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:02,210
Will that...

769
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,280
be enough to oust
Master Kim from Doldam Hospital?

770
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,650
It depends on how we make it look.

771
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,750
You did a great deal.

772
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:17,690
You accomplished something
even Park Min Guk couldn't.

773
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:21,599
What's your name?

774

Yang Ho Jun, sir.

775
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,269
From now on,

776
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,300
I will remember your name.

779
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,489
What are you doing? Waiting for me?

780
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,730
Shall we have a coffee?

781
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:05,840
It tastes good.

782
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,820
Talk to me. You have
something to say.

783
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,389
What?

784
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,599
Do you read minds now?

785
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,329
I've known you since medical school.

786
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,730
Just a look at your face...

787
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:35,840
and I can tell if you're in
a good mood or bad.

788
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,510
I can tell if you're suffering
or embarrassed.

789
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,150
Or if you have something to say.

790
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,210
I can tell that much.

791
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,480
The truth is,

792
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,619
Professor Oh called.

793
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:55,559
Some urgent cases came in,

794
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,389
and he has three
overlapping operations.

795
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,929
He asked if I could
help with just those.

796
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:03,159
It'll take 2 or 3 days.

797
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,400
So you're going to
Geodae Medical Center?

798
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:12,239
How can I say no to my professor?

799
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,480
Can I go for a few days?

800
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,489
Yes. You can.

- Good morning.

804
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:58,690
Hi. Sleepy morning.

Good morning.

Good morning, Dr. Yun.

807
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,590
How did your exam go?

808
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:07,230
When are the results out?

809
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,559
Who wants coffee?

810
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,300
Me.

811
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,239
What are you doing alone?

812
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:29,219
Thinking of how I can
hide from everyone.

813
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,320
Don't worry when you don't
even know what the results are.

Everyone at Doldam Hospital...

815
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,829
seem to be geniuses.

Why am I such a dunce?

817
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:46,170
You're a genius too.

818
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:49,269
- I am?
- Yes.

819
01:07:50,769 --> 01:07:51,809
Your smiles are genius.

820

You were so stiff for a while
that I was afraid of you.

823
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,519
I wasn't being stiff.

824
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,789
I was being silly.

825
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,260
The truth is,
when I heard that you...

826
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,069
and Dr. Do were related,

827
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:22,800
I felt this weird gap
or distance between us.

828
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,739
It's true that In Beom
comes from a great family,

829
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,979
but my family's just ordinary.

830
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,079
My dad teaches elementary students
at school.

831
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,109
Aunt and Uncle were always busy,

832
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:35,649
so In Beom used to hang out at ours.

833
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,350
I started to bug him
after starting medical school.

834
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,119
Why do you like me, Ah Reum?

835
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,029
You're good-looking.

836
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,729
You have a good-looking face,
a good-looking mind,

837
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,770
and a good-looking heart.

838
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,289
From now on,

839
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:19,960
I'll try to be an even
better looking boyfriend.

840
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:26,770
Okay.

841
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,810
Let's take a look.

842
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:43,649
Let's see.

843
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,430
- How does it feel?
- Good.

844
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:57,460
The chronic pain
that bothered me is gone,

845
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,170
and I can move my wrist much easier.

846
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:03,970
At this rate, I could
start operating even today.

847
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,510
You can't.

848
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:10,779
Avoid surgery as well as
any strenuous activities.

849
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:13,380
Don't worry, doctor.

850
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:15,180
With this wrist,

851
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:19,020
I can work for another 30 years
with no problem.

852
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,689
Keep taking your medications.
Starting next week,

853
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,159
we'll begin rehab.

854
01:10:27,229 --> 01:10:29,029
And do as you're told this time.

855
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:30,970
I will, Bone Doctor.

856
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,069
Master Kim!

857
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,539
It has come at last. Look.

858
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,409
Later.

859
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,369
Let's talk about it later.

860
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,510
Oh, okay. I understand.

861
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:55,319
We don't have to worry.

862
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,789
The surgery went really well
and he's recovering fast.

863
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,399
It looks like he's being
very careful too.

864
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,329
Okay. That's fine.

865
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:07,170
What about Eun Jae?

866
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,270
She still hasn't called?

867
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,409
- 2 days?
- 2 to 3 days.

868
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,409
Two days.

869
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:20,850
Okay. Two days.

870
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,630
I'll come for you
if you don't return.

871
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:38,970
Mister.

872
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:42,970
The person I care for
the most is right here.

873
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:45,069
How could I not return?

874
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,840
Right?

875
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:53,949
Drive safely. Okay?

876
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:56,649
Okay.

877
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,970
That's what she said.

878
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:15,170
But it's been a week.
No, not a week.

879
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:19,510
For almost 10 days,
she hasn't called or come back.

880
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:22,109
Professor Oh got her good.

881
01:12:22,109 --> 01:12:26,010
He's famous for having
a thing for talent.

882
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,680
If someone's just a bit good,

883
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,850
he wants that person
to work for him.

884
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:32,689
He's known for managing
his own people.

885
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:35,359
You won't eat your ramyeon?

886
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:36,689
- It's getting cold.
- Right.

887
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,989
Anyway,

888
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,930
I think that Eun Jae...

889
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,239
She won't come back, Woo Jin.

890
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,050
Suction, please.

891
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,390
Suction.

892
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,619
Suture.

893
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:10,319
Suture.

894
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,670
- Cut.
- Cut.

895
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,770
What happened to you...

896
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,279
at Doldam in the past two months?

897
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:32,609
I owe all this to Master Kim.

898
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,180
I learned so much.

899
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,319
Since you're already here,

900
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,520
take the lobectomy case too.

901
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,189
I already did three more operations
than we agreed on.

902
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:45,689
With your skills,
after just a year or two here,

903
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:47,729
you could rule the whole department.

904
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:50,630
Why go back to
a hospital in the outback?

905
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,130
Stay with me and
you could gain wings.

906
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,569
I'll make sure you fly high.

907
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,939
Why didn't you say that sooner?

908
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,109
When I was lost and a mess,

909
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,310
when I dozed off
or passed out in the OR,

910
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,750
you could've believed in me
and taught me then too.

911
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,850
Back then, you were a dreadful mess.

912
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,560
Do you know Koi's Law?

913
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:20,260
What's that?

914
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,229
Depending on the fish tank
or pond they're kept in,

915
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:25,199
the koi grows to be a certain size.

916
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,000
What does that have to do with you?

917
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,500
I'm sorry but...

918
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,699
I believe that...

919
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,840
the aquarium
you can provide for me...

920
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,310
is a little too small.

921
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,050
I'll get going.

922
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:47,720
My gosh.

923
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,029
Master Kim said this.

924
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,560
People do as well as
they're trusted to.

925
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,600
They become
as strong as they're care for,

926
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,670
and grow as much as
they're acknowledged.

927
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:06,569
The surroundings
and mindset that I choose...

928
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,180
bring upon
a huge difference in result.

929
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:17,220
I heard you operated
15 times in the last week.

930
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:19,819
The staff praised you...

931
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:22,260
for your prowess in the OR.

932
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,029
You're such a great
emergency surgeon.

933
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,529
How did you manage to operate
only on cancer patients?

934
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:32,470
I told you all along,
from the start that...

935
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,430
I like routine.

936
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:36,539
Stable situations
that follow a pattern.

937
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:38,739
Situations that I can control.

938
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:42,039
Shall I make a bet?

939
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,850
You fall exactly in my category.

940
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:51,689
You used me as an excuse,

941
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:54,350
but you were drawn here.

942
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,789
I was not. You're mistaken.

943
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,390
Let's just work together.

944
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,359
Twisted surgeons like you and I...

945
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,829
don't suit working with VIPs.

946
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,899
Rather than work in Seoul,

947
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,140
we're better off saving people
in the countryside.

948
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:14,539
That suits us much better.

949
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,210
Don't you think so?

950
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:22,380
So stop running away.

951
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,949
If I agree to remain here,

952
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,689
it'll be much more
of a hassle for you.

953
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,529
An adequate amount of anxiety...

954
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:38,600
isn't always a bad thing.

955
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:44,500
I can't work with
this kind of system.

956
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,470
Do you have any ideas?

957
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,979
If I'm to remain here,

958
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:52,510
within three years,

959
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:56,779
I want to open government-funded
regional trauma center.

960
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,390
A trauma center is something
I want more than anything.

961
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,930
That means getting involved with
lots of politics.

962
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:11,430
Can you handle that?

963
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:14,739
Deal. Let's do it.

964
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:19,739
Okay?

965
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:24,109
Guess what?

966
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,720
Master Kim.

967
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:35,319
You're a real lunatic.

968
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:03,550
Hi.

969
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,189
Get the Ministry of Health and
Welfare's Assistant Secretary Lee.

970
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:11,560
Just like that,
Master Kim started to put...

971
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:14,800
Doldam Hospital's dreams
slowly into place.

972
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,300
(Exam Results)

973
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,270
At last.

974
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:24,100
Drumroll, please.

975
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,840
Drumroll.

976
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,510
Oh?

977
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:31,909
Oh.

978
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:32,909
What is it?

979
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:34,649
What's wrong?

980
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,550
Did I fail?

981
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:43,659
It's okay.

982
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:45,329
I'll study hard...

983
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,729
and take the exam again next year.

984
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,829
For the future I dream of
in 20 years' time,

985
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,229
I can sacrifice a year.

986
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,199
You passed.

987
01:18:58,510 --> 01:18:59,569
What?

988
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:06,010
For real? I really passed?

989
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:09,149
Of course, you passed.
96 percent of the applicants did.

990
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:10,220
Let me see.

991
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,149
It's here.

992
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,989
My name is here.

993
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:16,720
I can't believe I passed!

994
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,529
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

995
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:22,229
- Congratulations.
- Buy us dinner.

996
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,560
What do you want to be
in 20 years' time?

997
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,569
Oh, that?

998
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:29,670
In 20 years,

999
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:32,670
I want to be
the next Master Kim of Doldam.

1000
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:36,310
That's different.

1001
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:39,550
Hang on. In 20 years, I will be...

1002
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,609
68 years old.

1003
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,119
Then I'll be Doldam's
next head nurse.

1004
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:46,949
That would be amazing!

1005
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:50,920
The future Master Kim
and head nurse.

1006
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,960
I'd like that.

1007
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,659
Master Kim and you, Ms. Oh
should work harder.

1008
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:55,829
So they don't catch up.

1009
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:58,029
If it's to these two,
I'm more than willing...

1010
01:19:58,029 --> 01:20:00,029
to make way at any time.

1011
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,500
- Don't you think?
- I totally agree.

1012
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,239
You two have been
agreeing on things...

1013
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,039
very naturally these days.

1014
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:10,939
- Let's get back to work.
- Back to work.

1015
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,479
How dare you?

1016
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,609
- You're a specialist now.
- What will you buy us?

1017
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:15,979
Hey!

1018
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,750
I'll expose you for dating.

1019
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,710
What brought you here again?

1020
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,020
It's obvious why
I'd come to see you.

1021
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,619
One, I want to get rid of you
from this hospital.

1022
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,359
What's the other reason?

1023
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,859
I want to get rid of
this hospital too.

1024
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:05,500
Chairman Do.
You're so very consistent.

1025
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:08,800
I commend you for that much.

1026
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:16,939
You have multiple sclerosis.

1027
01:21:24,449 --> 01:21:25,720
So what?

1028
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:30,060
You dropped a tool in the OR.

1029
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,460
You even had surgery
for carpal tunnel syndrome.

1030
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,229
Your wrist is damaged,

1031
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,659
and your nerves
will slowly deteriorate.

1032
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:39,729
Do you still think you can operate?

1033
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,569
Why can't I?

1034
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,670
The CTS surgery went well
and I'm recovering just fine.

1035
01:21:47,109 --> 01:21:48,739
The multiple sclerosis
isn't serious,

1036
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:50,840
and I'm controlling it
with medication. So what?

1037
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,949
The thing is,

1038
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,449
multiple sclerosis...

1039
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:58,590
can become a huge issue
if we want it to be.

1040
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,689
That's true.

1041
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:02,819
If you make an issue
out of a non-issue,

1042
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:05,729
then it becomes an issue.

1043
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:06,760
That's why...

1044
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:10,060
the board of Geodae Foundation...

1045
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,199
is considering your dismissal
seriously.

1046
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:15,869
Why would you be doing that here?

1047
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:16,939
Don't you know?

1048
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:20,340
Geodae Foundation
has full control over...

1049
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,909
Geodae Medical Center
and Doldam Hospital's...

1050
01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:24,609
personnel matters.

1051
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,220
Manager Jang!

1052
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:35,520
Yes?

1053
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,529
Give me that envelope.

1054
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,810
How beautiful.

1055
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,850
(Medical Corporation Permit)

1056
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:02,750
This just happened to arrive today.

1057
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:07,590
(Doldam Medical Foundation,
Representative: Boo Yong Joo)

1058
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,859
- What's this?
- You didn't know?

1059
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,359
Now Doldam Hospital...

1060
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:16,529
has nothing to do with
Geodae Medical Center.

1061
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:18,569
It's an independent
medical foundation.

1062
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:20,829
What?

1063
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,800
Geodae Foundation pays us
four million dollars each year,

1064
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,739
but management and administration...

1065
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,140
are kept completely separate.

1066
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:35,949
That's according to the will of
the late Chairman Shin Myung Ho.

1067
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:41,250
Things have been hectic
with his inheritance issue.

1068
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,029
Actually, he's a match for you.

1069
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,229
His strings...

1070
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,970
are still well attached.

1071
01:24:03,609 --> 01:24:06,109
(Chairman Do Yun Wan)

1072
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:09,550
Hello, Chairman Do.
It has been a long time.

1073
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,590
Yes, that. That's true.

1074
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,750
It's in my father's will.

1075
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:19,229
Dealing with that is
what delayed the inheritance issues.

1076
01:24:22,659 --> 01:24:23,829
I had no choice.

1077
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,569
He said I wouldn't get anything...

1078
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:29,270
unless I keep Doldam Hospital open.

1079
01:24:30,369 --> 01:24:33,010
That's why I did that,
so don't be too upset.

1080
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:35,609
By the way.

1081
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,550
Master Kim. How is he?

1082
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:54,930
No one is on my side! No one!

1083
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:06,310
Chairman Do.

1084
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:11,409
I have no one. No one!

1085
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:16,250
- Chairman Do!
- Don't ever come here again.

1086
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,420
Shut up!

1087
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,520
Don't come after us!

1088
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,689
And stay out of our business.

1089
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,489
Don't twist facts and
turn them into nonsense...

1090
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,659
that you think looks believable.

1091
01:25:30,829 --> 01:25:34,829
People who don't know the truth
will actually believe it!

1092
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:37,539
You scumbag. Boo Yong Joo!

1093
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:42,609
Let go!

1094
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,640
- Hey.
- Let go.

1095
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:48,619
It has creases because of you.

1096
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:52,350
Can you stop causing a ruckus
and please leave?

1097
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,520
Move.

1098
01:25:58,859 --> 01:25:59,859
Step aside.

1099
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:04,029
Don't you know who I am, you fool?

1100
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,699
I'm the chairman of the foundation.

1101
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:14,970
Mr. Koo!

1102
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,409
Please leave.

1103
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,579
Sir.

1104
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,399
Master Kim! Bad news.

1105
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,239
What is it?

1106
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,939
A fire broke out in a sauna.

1107
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,609
How many were injured?

1108
01:26:45,609 --> 01:26:47,239
24 dead and wounded so far.

1109
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:49,140
Seven of them are critical.

1110
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,010
- Did you all hear that?
- Yes.

1111
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:53,850
It's currently 24,
but that number can go up.

1112
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:55,319
- Ms. Oh!
- Yes?

1113
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:57,420
Have someone on site
separate them by severity.

1114
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,250
Send the minor cases
to local hospitals...

1115
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:02,359
and critical patients
are to be sent straight to us.

1116
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,460
Okay.

1117
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,060
Woo Jin, Bone Doctor, Mr. Park.

1118
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:09,699
With Dr. Jung,
check the incoming patients.

1119
01:27:09,699 --> 01:27:11,029
- Okay.
- Hurry.

1120
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:12,100
Let's go.

1121
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,470
- Manager Jang.
- Yes, Master Kim.

1122
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,640
Call President Park and say...

1123
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,710
I'm here.

1124
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:33,050
Why are you just standing there?
You won't get to work?

1125
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,619
No, I will.

1126
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,829
I'll get changed real quick.

1127
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,800
How about we go and prepare the ORs?

1128
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:54,840
I said I'd play video games
with my son today.

1129
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:08,819
Did you see that?

1130
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,329
That's what doctors do.

1131
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:23,199
The law of romantic conservation.

1132
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:27,869
Most people know they exist,

1133
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,109
but believe they don't.

1134
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:33,779
Yet they still hope that
someone preserves them.

1135
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:35,550
Those beautiful values.

1136
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,289
Living means taking
a new path every day.

1137
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,460
Whether you want it or not,

1138
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:49,960
you face the reality
that comes at you each day.

1139
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:54,930
Incoming!

1140
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,109
- Dr. Jung. Bed 1.
- Okay. Bed 1!

1141
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,340
To the hybrid room.

1142
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,949
Bed 2.

1143
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,279
Come this way.

1144
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:11,520
- 2, 3.
- We'll remove this. Step aside.

1145
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,649
Both sides.

1146
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,720
We can't get things right
all the time,

1147
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,489
but Master Kim always said this.

1148
01:29:20,289 --> 01:29:21,689
Don't give up asking...

1149
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:25,970
why we live and what we live for.

1150
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,539
