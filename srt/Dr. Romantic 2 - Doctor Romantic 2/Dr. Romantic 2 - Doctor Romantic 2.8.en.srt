3
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:11,109
Truth be told,
I wanted to be a violinist.

4
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,049
But my teacher one day...

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,780
told me I didn't have the talent...

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,150
and that I should
only play the violin as a hobby.

7
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,219
After crying for two days straight,
I finally gave up on my dream.

8
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,980
Not being competent enough
seems to be the same story...

9
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,209
in this line of work too.

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,349
I should've realized it that day
when I first...

11
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,780
dissected a human cadaver.

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,150
I should have...

13
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,519
made a run for it.

14
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,969
I probably should
answer this call though, right?

15
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
Come on. Let's go.

16
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,169
You can't let this slide, sir.

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't care if everyone here
follows his orders.

18
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,699
He's still only a department head.

19
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,139
How dare he confronts
the president like that.

20
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,379
It was uncalled for
especially in the staff's presence.

21
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,979
Your principles? What a joke.

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,479
You're only cowardly
avoiding any trouble...

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,580
just to keep your hands clean.

24
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,520
This is a matter
of respect and discipline.

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,590
You must make him...

26
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,620
and every employee here
bow down to you.

27

And one of the inmates

ended up with vascular trauma.

Incoming.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,650
- How is his level of consciousness?
- He's alert.

36
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,750
Take him to the hybrid room.

37
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,620
Please be careful.

38
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,289
He's really young.

39
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,189
Yes, you're right.
I heard he murdered two people.

40
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,389
But he's a lot younger
than I thought he'd be.

- Ms. Uhm!
- On my way!

42
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,530
- We're going to move him now.
- Okay.

43
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,829
No, wait.

44
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,759
Can you uncuff him?

45
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,300
- Let's move him. 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

46
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,709
- His vitals?
- 80 over 40. 110bpm.

47
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,180
Give him 300cc of half saline
at top speed.

48
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,379
And bring me two PRBCs.

49
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,389
- Warm saline?
- Yes, warm.

50
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,420
He has ESRD,
so make sure you don't overdose him.

51
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,889
Should we insert the IV
on his right arm?

52
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,800
Yes, let's do that.

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,029
Okay.

54
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,600
I heard he has ESRD.

55
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,100
How long have you been
on hemodialysis?

56
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,310
Five years.

57
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,610
Five years ago,
he had kidney failure...

58
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,779
due to the abuse of drugs.

59
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,480
And ever since, he's been receiving
hemodialysis three times a week...

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

61
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,120
What if it's completely damaged?

62
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,160
- Dr. Jung.
- Yes?

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,819
We need to stop the bleeding first.

64
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,930
So let's move him to the OR
and carry out a suture.

65
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,930
Okay, sir.

66
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,629
I'll give him a second-generation
cephalosporin.

67
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,629
- Get me some gauze and EB.
- Okay.

68
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,040
- Please call Dr. Cha for me.
- Okay.

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,410
I'm here, sir.
What's the patient's condition?

70
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,240
He has ESRD.

71
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,680
He's been on hemodialysis
for five years.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,850
And his AVF got damaged.

73
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:44,250
He's an inmate,
and he's being very uncooperative.

74
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,319
The damaged AVF is
pretty much useless now,

75
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,449
so it needs to be sutured.

76
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,420
Then he needs to receive surgery
for a new blood vessel.

77
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,029
Should I place a hemodialysis
catheter for temporary treatment?

78
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,629
Yes, you should do that.

79
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,430
Then schedule AVF surgery
on his other arm.

80
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,629
Okay, sir.

81
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,600
How are you?

82
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,310
Are you okay?

83
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,180
I'm trying to be okay.

84
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,750
Just let it go.
It wasn't your fault.

85
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,050
Okay?

86
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,129
Call me if anything happens.

87
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,959
Thank you.

88
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:34,899
Thank you for saying that.

89
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,980
Dr. Cha, should we move the patient?

90
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes.

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,350
Mr. Park.

92
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,220
Will you come with me to the OR?

93
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,850
Yes, of course.

94
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,009
(On Your Way)

95
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,750
Is he not here?

96
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,600
We have an emergency patient.

97
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,259
I'll be done once the doctor
sutures his blood vessel...

98
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,800
and inserts a catheter.

99
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,230
I won't be too late.

100
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,100
Okay.

101
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,120
Please excuse me for a bit.

102
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,319
He even has tattoos
on his inguinal region.

103
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,120
Mr. Park, how are things
on your side?

104
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,060
This part is a mess too.
It's covered in pus.

105
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,129
The same goes for his neck.

106
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,930
Where did you get your tattoos?
They're all festered.

107
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,370
He probably got them in prison.

108
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,569
"In prison"?

109
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,269
Isn't that illegal?

110
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,139
They give each other tattoos
when the guards aren't around.

111
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,410
A friend of mine
also got a tattoo in prison.

112
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,120
You have a friend
who went to prison?

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,120
If it weren't for Master Kim,
I probably won't be here.

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,059
Come here and take a look.
This side of his neck seems okay.

115
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,100
Yes, this will do.

116
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,230
He was given
preoperative antibiotics...

117
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,269
before the suturing process, right?

118
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:49,269
Yes.

119
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,570
We're going to insert a catheter
on the right side of your neck.

120
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,539
So will you please
turn your head this way?

121
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,009
Sir.

122
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,340
You need to get this
in order to receive hemodialysis.

123
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,950
If this part also gets infected,

124
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,750
a kidney transplant
will be your only option.

125
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,889
Who would give a murderer
his or her kidney?

126
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,730
Who in the world would do that?

127
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,929
So you should let the doctor
insert the catheter.

128
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,470
There might not be a donor,
but you still need to live.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,470
We need to insert a catheter
so you can receive hemodialysis.

130
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,600
Now, turn your head.

131
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,639
Turn your head.

132
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,519
Sir, you need to stay still.

133
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,350
Get me a new pair of gloves
and a drape.

134
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,129
Incoming!

135
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,200
A paramedic got injured?

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,470
This is Choi Soon Young.

137
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,669
What happened?

138
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,110
She got hit on the head
at around 5pm...

139
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,269
while trying to save a drunk man.

140
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,809
And about 15 minutes ago,
she suddenly collapsed,

141
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,240
and she's been unconscious
ever since.

142
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:08,950
Let's move her to the hybrid room.

143
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,049
Okay.

144
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,379
- Ms. Uhm, call Master Kim.
- Okay.

145
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,990
Master Kim, I'm calling from the ER.

146
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,340
Miss.

147
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,879
She's in a coma.

148
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,379
- Her vitals?
- 100 over 60. 70bpm.

149
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,820
- Get me an intubation tube.
- Okay.

150
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,850
Prepare an IV line
and give her 1L of normal saline.

151
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,919
Okay.

152
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,559
Here.

153
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,399
Fix it at 22cm.

154
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,379
She's having a cardiac arrest.
I'll get on top of her.

155
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,250
Give her 1ml of epinephrine
every 3 minutes.

156
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,279
Okay.

157
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,190
Ms. Oh, who did you say this is?

158
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,389
Choi Soon Young.

159
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,230
She suddenly collapsed
and lost her consciousness.

160
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,629
Let me check her heart rate.

161
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,740
ROSC?

162
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,110
It came back pretty quickly.

163
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,110
- Her vitals?
- 140 over 70. 110bpm.

164
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Ms. Oh.

165
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,980
Connect a center line.

166
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,450
Mix 500ml of 5DW
with 30ml of norepinephrine...

167
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,419
and give it at 10cc per hour.

168
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
Okay.

169
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,019
I'll do it.

170
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,190
Should I call for a chest portable?

171
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,259
No, she needs to get
a CT scan first.

172
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,860
Then she can take a chest x-ray
on her way back.

173
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,519
Both her pupils are dilated.

174
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,889
There's a problem with her brain,
isn't there?

175
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,100
The center line is ready.

176
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,639
She's ready for a CT scan.

177
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,700
Let's move the patient.

178
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,809
Mr. Heo.

179
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,649
Have you contacted her guardian?

180
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,649
Yes.

181
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,289
She lives with her single mother,
and we were able to reach her.

182
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,590
She's on her way here.

183
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,059
Is her condition very bad?

184
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,200
I heard she suddenly collapsed
out of nowhere.

185
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,299
Can you tell me what happened?

186
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,240
She went to save a drunk
and got hit on her head a few times.

187
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,840
Sir, you need to wake up.

188
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,809
How much did you drink?

189
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,340
Gosh, stop being annoying
and get out of my sight.

190
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,080
It's very cold outside.
Let's get up first.

191
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,580
Darn you. How dare you
boss me around?

192
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,190
- Sir, don't do that.
- You fools.

193
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,389
- Darn you.
- Gosh.

194
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,450
Don't do this.

195
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,090
- What's wrong with you?
- Darn you.

196
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,929
- Let go!
- Come on, sir.

197
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,860
She was fine for about
two hours or so.

198
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,860
Then she suddenly threw up,
saying she didn't feel well.

199
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,970
Then she collapsed
and won't wake up.

200
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,299
I think that...

201
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,710
there's a problem with her brain.

202
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,539
We must see the CT scan to be sure,

203
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,580
but both her pupils...

204
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,509
are fully dilated.

205
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,509
- What?
- What?

206
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,429
Oh, no...

207
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,470
Hold the probe for me.

208
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Okay.

209
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,940
Local anesthesia.

210
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,440
Sir, this will hurt a bit.
You can make a noise.

211
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,120
The tube.

212
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,960
You can move the probe.

213
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,379
You'll feel this go in.

214
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,509
It's done. We just
have to secure it.

215
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,480
You're pretty good.

216
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,789

218
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,730
We're almost there. This way.

- Ma'am.
- Oh. Here you all are.

222
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,450
You said Soon Young's hurt.
Where exactly?

223
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,990
How badly hurt is she?

224
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
The thing is, ma'am...

225
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,289
What? Is it bad?

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,129
Soon Young.

227
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,799
Where is she?

228
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,909
It looks like...

229
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,379
we're helpless.

230
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,139
Is it a SAH?

(SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage)

232
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,110
It is a SAH,

233
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,049
but not caused by
the trauma to the head.

234
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,649
Was it spontaneous?

235
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,019
But then, we can't
completely rule out...

236
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,220
a causal relationship
between the two.

237
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,730
How is Ms. Choi doing right now?

238
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,730
She's not breathing on her own
and no stem signs either.

Doctor.

244
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,430
I was told that my Soon Young
was badly hurt.

245
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,440
We took a CT scan.

246
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,680
It looks like...

247
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,480
there's bleeding in her brain.

248
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,319
Can she live if she has surgery?

249
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,730
Soon Young's pretty healthy.

250
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,700
We'll have to see how she does,

251
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,230
but as of right now,

252
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,339
it looks a bit helpless.

253
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,210
But can't you still...

254
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,279
operate on her?

255
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,220
People from all over...

256
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,819
say that if you operate,

257
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,519
everyone lives.

258
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,829
Can't Soon Young...

259
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,369
Can't you operate on her too?

260
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Please?

261
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,309
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

262
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,980
As of right now, there's...

263
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,819
There's nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

264
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,049
I'm sorry.

What's up? Is something wrong?

274

A paramedic was brought in
with a head injury.

275

Yes. Probably.

into a lifer's neck.

He murdered two people.

283
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,720
He doesn't seem to be
interested in living himself.

284

Look.

289

You cared for a patient
after getting cut in the neck.

290

That mindset in a doctor
is a talent.

Someone asked me for directions
to the hospital,

00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:41,920
Mr. Park.

331
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:44,920
it's cold outside.
You should hurry back inside.

332
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,460
Is that Manager Jang?

333
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:52,059
Yes, the ER team gathered
to have a drink.

334
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,759
I see.

335
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,170
You should spend time
with them today then.

336
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,299
What about you?

337
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,299
I'll take a rain check.

338
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,640
Mr. Park, aren't you coming?

339
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,710
The stew will get cold.

340
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,720
You should join them.
Have a good time.

341
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,200
Unbelievable.
The food here is great.

342
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,569
Have some wine too.

343
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,079
No way. This is phenomenal.

344
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,220
Do you know your wine?

345
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,289
Of course, I don't.

346
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,920
Truth be told, I'm more into soju.

347
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,089
I enjoy soju mixed with beer.

348
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,529
Are you and Dr. Seo close?

349
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,700
I don't know.

350
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,000
Either we're close
or just well-acquainted.

351
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,710
We've known each other
since medical school,

352
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,470
so I know what he's like.

353
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,839
Then...

354
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,579
do you know how
his parents passed away?

355
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,519
Sorry?

356
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,519
I think he was in middle school.

357
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:27,460
His parents died
due to a tragic accident.

358
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,160
I see you didn't know.

359
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,029
I had no idea.

360
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,039
Doesn't it sting?

361
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,279
I figured he didn't have
the best upbringing but...

362
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:51,819
- Call me if there are any issues.
- Sure.

363
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,630
I vaguely assumed
that there was a story...

364
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,700
behind his grumpy attitude, but...

365
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,849
(Hankuk Milk)

366
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,119
I never guessed...

367
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,420
that he had made it this far
without any family to lean on.

368
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,400
Dr. Yun?

369
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,460
Didn't you head home?

370
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,269
Dr. Seo, I'm glad you're here.

371
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,700
I ordered fried chicken.
Do you want to join me?

372
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,569
- Cheers!
- Cheers, everybody.

373
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,119
Why isn't Mr. Park coming back in?

374
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:01,519
Beats me.
He was on the phone with someone.

375
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,549
Gosh, that's good.
It just washes everything down.

376
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,519
There's more where that came from,
so dig in.

377
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,529
- Sure.
- Thanks.

378
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,559
What is it? Is something wrong?

379
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,470
Oh, it's nothing.

380
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,000
Are you perhaps
seeing someone, Manager Park?

381
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,039
Really?

382
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:23,740
Must you rub it in like that?

383
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,710
I'd be glad
if that's who is texting me.

384
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,950
Where are you off to?

385
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,420
The restroom...

386
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,279
also known as the washroom
or the toilet.

387
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,589
Unbelievable.

388
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,289
You have been
looking dandy these days.

389
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,319
I bet you're seeing someone!

390
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,390
He's right!

391
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,130
Yes, this is Manager Jang.

392
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,630
Where are you again?
Yes, of course, I know.

393
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,200
I'll be right there.

394
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,670
Taxi!

395
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,440
You won't believe it.

396
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:02,180
You see, I came across Ms. Oh.

397
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,210
She was staring at something.

398
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,119
I guess she was looking
for the menu.

399
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,349
Don't you agree?

400
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,119
Should we get her some?

401
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,119
Gosh, she'd love that!

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,829
I'm sorry.
I had trouble catching a cab.

403
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,569
Please catch your breath.

404
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:31,569
Thank you.

405
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,480
Goodness.

406
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,990
Now, I'd like to ask...

407
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:46,119
why you called me here
at this late hour.

408
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,029
We needed someone
to discuss the hospital with.

409
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,829
There's no one at Doldam...

410
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,559
who could provide a better insight.

411
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,930
That's true, I guess.

412
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,670
So,

413
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,180
what is this about?

414
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,210
Truth be told,

415
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,180
both President Park and I...

416
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,220
have great concerns
regarding Doldam.

417
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,779
There are no rules
and everything is done on the fly.

418
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,190
Every major decision is made by...

419
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,119
Master Kim.

420
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,289
It is not only dangerous
but also preposterous.

421
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,460
We don't have enough staff members,

422
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,829
but trauma patients
come flooding in, and...

423
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:32,069
President Park wishes to arrange
a more sensible system...

424
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,470
that is better structured.

425
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,569
In order to do so,

426
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,140
he must be able to take the reins.

427
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,349
Take the reins?

428
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:43,349
Here.

429
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,750
Shouldn't the hospital...

430
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,019
be restructured...

431
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,849
so that it centers around
President Park?

432
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,259
Are you talking about...

433
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,259
setting the tone in some way?

434
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,529
Do you have any ideas?

435
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,109
If you're looking for
the fastest and most effective way,

436
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,880
it's money.

437
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,220
Good faith and justice
may be important,

438
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,859
but what holds all the power
to our lives...

439
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,460
is money.

440
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,660
Money, or the money.

441
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,700
That is why
you will all receive a raise.

442
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:44,410
First and foremost,
you will all receive...

443
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,339
a raise of five percent.

444
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,109
Overtime pay will also
be increased...

445
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,349
by five percent.

446
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,750
- Thank you so much.
- Nice!

447
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,289
- Bravo!
- I can't believe it.

448
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,420
And just like that,

449
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,690
he erases President Yeo
by flashing around some money.

450
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,029
No way.

451
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:07,900
Someone's presence
can't be erased with chump change.

452
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,529
But why is this making me uneasy?

453
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,970
- Park Min Guk.
- Park Min Guk.

454
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,140
- Park Min Guk!
- Park Min Guk!

455
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,940
- Park Min Guk.
- Park Min Guk.

456
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,650
Dr. Cha.

457
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,059
Dr. Yang.

458
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,289
So,

459
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,559
have you been
looking for other hospitals?

460
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,599
You said I had a month.

461
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,730
And?

462
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,170
You'll take that long?

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,039
Dr. Yang.

464
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,339
What can I do to subside your anger?

465
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,240
If you let me know...

466
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,410
There's no way.

467
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,819
What if I try harder?

468
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,549
I'll do better.
If you give me the second chance...

469
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,990
There are a few things
one can never let slide.

470
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,089
Those who think
they're better than their seniors.

471
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,230
Those who stick
their noses into everything.

472
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,900
If you generously
give them the second chance,

473
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,569
they stab you
right in the back once again.

474
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,700
Getting rid of them
is the only solution.

475
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,539
Let me stay until
I'm allowed back at Geodae.

476
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,509
As if anyone would want you back.

477
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,049
Get your head out of the clouds...

478
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,480
and look for another hospital
to work at, Dr. Cha.

479
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,700
What was that?

480
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,269
It was nothing.
There's no need for you to know.

481
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:55,869
The loan sharks.

482
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,039
Did they come by again?

483
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,210
Please...

484
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,980
I'd rather not talk about that
with you.

485
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,779
Right.

486
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,420
I guess we shouldn't then.

487
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,659
It's not like we've been
that close as friends anyway.

488
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,690
Right?

489
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,360
What's gotten into you?

490
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,130
Come to think of it,
it turns out that...

491
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,699
we know nothing about each other.

492
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,699
A twisted turn of events...

493
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,800
brought us to Doldam
at the same time,

494
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,869
and that led us to become close...

495
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:31,510
due to our similar situations.

496
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,550
But it's not enough
to say that we're friends.

497
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:36,880
Right?

498
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,309
Is something up with you?

499
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,380
My life has been a mess
since the day I got here...

500
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,489
and that's still ongoing.

501
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,190
Tell me what's going on.

502
00:34:58,269 --> 00:34:59,670
Maybe later.

503
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:13,219
Sir, does this hurt?

504
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,949
What's his temperature?

505
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,219
It's 37.1℃.

506
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,119
Do you feel chilly?

507
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,300
I want CBC, ESR, CRP,

508
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,170
and a catheter tip culture.

509
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,599
What about his hemodialysis?

510
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,570
Right. Hold on.

511
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,010
A procedure on the other side
will lead to inflammation.

512
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,780
Let's not take it out yet.

513
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,320
We'll switch it to
a third-generation cephalosporin...

514
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,650
and give him vancomycin.

515
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,050
Before giving him the antibiotics,
conduct a blood culture...

516
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,889
and also replace...

517
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,019
his hemodialysis catheter.

518
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,889
Give him a propacetamol IV
if needed.

519
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:04,670
Was the full bag of mannitol given?

520
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,170
Yes, Dr. Seo.

521
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,369
And her temperature?

522
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,440
It's 36.8℃.

523
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,969
Is norepinephrine being administered
with a micro drip tube?

524
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,010
Yes.

525
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,940
She's still not breathing
on her own...

526
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,409
and there are no brainstem reflexes.

527
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,920
I'm afraid she's brain dead.

528
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,329
As a doctor,
what makes us helpless...

529
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,099
is when there's nothing
we can do for a patient.

530
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,679
Ma'am.

531
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,590
(Organ Donor Card, Choi Soon Young)

532
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,719
Doctor.

533
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,760
- Yes?
- Here.

534
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,360
My daughter
seems to have been registered.

535
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,400
(Organ Donor Card, Choi Soon Young)

536
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,940
(Cornea after death,)

537
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,210
(organs after brain death,

538
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,380
(Organ Donor Card, Choi Soon Young)

539
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,349
Please...

540
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,460
take good care of her, doctor.

541
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,380
Even in that sense of helplessness,

542
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,880
he didn't seem sad...

543
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,019
but angry.

544
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,230
Do you know where Master Kim is?

545
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,889
I texted him but he hasn't answered.

546
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,500
He's in a meeting right now.

547
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
The paramedic
who came in last Saturday...

548
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,099
is being declared as brain dead.

549
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,739
What's this about?

550
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,369
The patient with the catheter...

551
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,610
is running a slight fever
due to vasculitis.

552
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,909
- Did you remove the catheter?
- No.

553
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,510
I didn't since he's receiving
his hemodialysis today.

554
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,750
If this carries on,

555
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,280
his only option will be
a kidney transplant.

556
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,159
- Dr. Cha.
- Yes?

557
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:46,500
The paramedic who's about
to be declared brain dead...

558
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,530
has the same blood type.

559
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,599
Her blood type is A positive
just like your patient's.

560
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,539
As per our regulations,

561
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,380
we will commence a committee
to declare one's brain death.

562
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,110
In the ICU, there is a patient...

563
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,480
who has been suggested
as brain dead.

564
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,090
- Dr. Seo.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,889
She is a 39-year-old paramedic...

566
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,119
who was brought into the ER...

567
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,630
after suffering
a head injury on the job.

568
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,130
She was already
in a coma upon arrival.

569
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,300
One count
of cardiac arrest occurred,

570
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,670
but then ROSC was detected.

571
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:26,039
The CT scan of her brain
showed SAH,

572
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:29,070
and even after 36 hours
of her admittance,

573
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,010
there aren't any
spontaneous breathing...

574
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,380
or brainstem reflexes.

575
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,880
Did you crosscheck
with the neurological examination?

576
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,179
Yes, I did, but she didn't respond.

577
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,349
What about her EEG?

578
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,050
Her EEG result...

579
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,320
is enough to declare her brain dead.

580
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,719
The patient was registered
as an organ donor.

581
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,190
Do we have approval
from her next-of-kin?

582
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,260
Her mother...

583
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,869
informed us of
her daughter's wishes.

584
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,500
We will now conclude.

585
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,809
Does anyone have any objections...

586
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,809
with this declaration?

587
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,349
No.

588
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,010
No.

589
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,559
I declare her...

590
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,300
brain dead.

591
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,349
I feel awful considering
how young she still is.

592
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,980
I remember how she used to...

593
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,190
always smile when coming to the ER.

594
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,000
Master Kim, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

595
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,269
A kidney transplant?

596
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,099
For the lifer?

597
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,570
Vasculitis occurred where...

598
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,940
the hemodialysis catheter
was inserted...

599
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,579
and now he has a mild fever.

600
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,210
I checked for other areas,
but that won't be possible...

601
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,150
due to the inflammations
caused by all the tattoos.

602
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,119
And even if we manage to insert one,

603
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,949
it'll soon get infected again.

604
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,289
So what?

605
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:31,159
How is he going to get a transplant
when he's far behind the list?

606
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:37,829
The paramedic
who just got declared brain dead...

607
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:39,840
has the same blood type as his.

608
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:41,670
Eun Jae, are you serious?

609
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,369
Please let me carry out an HLA
typing and crossmatch testing.

610
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,079
If it turns out to be a match,

611
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,210
the priority goes to my patient.
Am I correct?

612
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,019
I don't agree with this.

613
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,260
Why not? I just want to check
if she's a suitable donor.

614
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,960
Her one and only daughter
was declared brain dead.

615
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,730
We should give her time to mourn.

616
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,530
I understand what you mean.

617
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,230
But she'll be giving it
to someone who really needs it.

618
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,539
On top of that,
she has a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

619
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,610
If we miss the right timing,

620
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,170
she might not be able to donate
any of her organs at all.

621
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,239
Do you...

622
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,079
Do you only care about the donee?

623
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,210
What's so wrong about trying to save
a patient while we can?

624
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,219
I'm just saying
we should show our respects.

625
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:28,679
Why can't you understand
what I'm trying to say?

626
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,250
Are you sure it's not because he's
a prisoner serving a life sentence?

627
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:33,559
- What?
- He murdered two people.

628
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,519
Is that why you're being like this?

629
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,829
We're talking about
a human being, okay?

630
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,469
She was someone's daughter,
a paramedic,

631
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,039
and a person named Choi Soon Young.

632
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,269
She isn't just an organ donor.

633
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,309
She was a human being.

634
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,250
What did I just hear?

635
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,489
You're going to donate
my daughter's organs...

636
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,530
to whom?

637
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,099
Why? Why won't the mother
donate her daughter's organs?

638
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,739
It's normal for guardians
to change their minds.

639
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,940
Let's give her some more time.

640
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:33,380
We already have six people
on the waiting list.

641
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,820
There's a 16-year-old pianist
who can't see...

642
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,949
and a man who's waiting to see
his son get married.

643
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:41,920
She'll be giving them
a second chance in life.

644
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,469
Will you please try to convince her?

645
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,349
No.

646
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,849
I'm not going to do that.

647
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:15,360
I'd be more than grateful
if she willingly decides to donate.

648
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,860
But even if she decides against it,

649
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I don't want to pressure her
to do something against her will.

650
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,929
I know it's important
to think about the donee.

651
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,039
But before all that,
we need to respect the decisions...

652
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,670
of the donors and their families.

653
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:33,280
That should always be the order.

654
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,219
Was I wrong again?

655
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,800
I guess you even schedule
appointments with Mr. Park...

656
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,469
and even go on dates with him.

657
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:58,769
Oh, that?

658
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,869
We just agreed to meet up
for some beer.

659
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,170
At On Your Way?

660
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,809
Well, yes.

661
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,780
I knew it. I knew it'd be you.

662
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,309
What?

663
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:12,079
Never mind.

664
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,480
Congratulations.

665
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,090
- On what?
- Your future.

666
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:19,820
What? What do you mean?

667
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,219
There's nothing going on between us.

668
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,130
I know, right? There's nothing
going on between you guys.

669
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,730
But I feel like I lost my chance
before I could even do anything.

670
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,199
This is very upsetting.

671
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,920
Did you tell Ms. Joo
that we planned to meet up...

672
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,789
for beer yesterday?

673
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:51,949
No, I didn't.

674
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,960
Then how did she find out?
It looked like Ms. Uhm knew as well.

675
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,530
What did Ms. Joo say?

676
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,800
She suddenly congratulated us
on our future.

677
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
Then she said she didn't even
get a chance to do anything.

678
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,829
What should we do?
What if everyone thinks that way?

679
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,400
- Is that so wrong?
- Yes, of course.

680
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,469
There's nothing going on between us.

681
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,440
We haven't even done anything yet.

682
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,840
I thought we did.

683
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,219
My gosh.

684
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,420
You're very straightforward.

685
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,219
Does it make you feel uncomfortable?

686
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,090
If that's the case,
I'll slow down a bit.

687
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,699
You even know
how to control your tempo?

688
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,969
You're like a professional.

689
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:45,670
I once had a crush on someone.

690
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,909
But I couldn't express my feelings
until she finally left.

691
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,920
And that's how it just ended.

692
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,090
I'm not going to make
the same mistake.

693
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,300
By any chance, are you...

694
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,570
asking me out?

695
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,409
I promise I won't be late next time.

696
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,280
But instead, you also shouldn't...

697
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,880
eat chicken with someone else
when you promised to meet me.

698
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,110
- They're taking out the catheter.
- Okay.

699
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,380
He also needs a fever reducer.

700
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,079
Please make way.

701
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,719
Let me see him just once.

702
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,420
Please let me see my son
just this once.

703
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,460
You're not allowed to go in
when it's not visiting hours.

704
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,630
My goodness,
what's going to happen to him?

705
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,940
Due to an increase in inflammation,

706
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,840
we decided to take out his catheter.

707
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,050
We'll try to look
for another blood vessel,

708
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,579
but it won't be easy.

709
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,250
If he doesn't receive dialysis,
he probably won't be able to last...

710
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,719
for more than three days.

711
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,300
My son.

712
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,710
My poor son.

713
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:09,250
What am I going to do? My poor son.

714
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,130
Here.

715
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:54,960
Master Kim...

716
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,699
told me to return it to you.

717
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,699
(Organ Donor Card, Choi Soon Young)

718
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,809
I heard he was bullied in school.

719
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:11,409
That young man
who's serving a life sentence.

720
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,619
His mom gave him medicine
that could help him concentrate...

721
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,489
so he could get better grades.

722
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,219
That's how his kidneys failed.

723
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,130
He was on dialysis,

724
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,530
and that's what made him
get bullied.

725
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,929
After a while of getting bullied,
he couldn't stand it anymore.

726
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,909
That's how he ended up
killing two people.

727
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:45,349
This is all my fault.

728
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,050
I was obsessed with money.

729
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,650
I was so focused on making money...

730
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,889
that I had absolutely no idea
what my son was going through.

731
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:00,630
All I ever told him
was to get good grades.

732
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,469
It's all my fault.

733
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:10,340
Those kids died because of me.

734
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,880
And I'm the reason
my son became sick.

735
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,550
It's all my fault.

736
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,500
That's what all moms are like.

737
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,329
When something bad
happens to their children,

738
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,670
they always think it's their fault.

739
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,219
The organ donation.

740
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,190
Let's do it.

741
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,800
My daughter's specialty...

742
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,769
was to help and
rescue those who suffered.

743
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,440
On her way out...

744
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,480
I guess she wanted to save someone.

745
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:35,519
To someone,

746
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,489
the grief and sadness
of having to say goodbye,

747
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,969
to others,

748
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,800
it sometimes becomes hope.

749
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,110
To someone,

750
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,750
it gives them
a renewed will to go on living.

751
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,989
(Choi Soon Young)

752
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:13,130
To the very end,
we must do our best to honor...

753
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,860
the donor and her mother.

754
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,070
Let's be respectful...

755
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,400
in the next procedures.

756
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,969
Yes, Master Kim.

757
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:24,570
Okay.

758
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,079
Okay.

759
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,889
(Doldam Hospital)

760
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,409
I'll turn off the ventilator
and set off.

761
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,719
- Okay.
- Okay.

762
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,539
Okay. I understand.

763
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:34,210
Choi Soon Young is on her way down.

764
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,610
Please be ready.

765
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,099
(Operating Room)

766
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,960
Goodbye,

767
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,389
my little girl.

768
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,940
Thank you for being my daughter.

769
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,480
I love you.

770
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,940
Ma'am.

771
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,480
We'll take her now.

772
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,820
Okay.

773
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,320
Ma'am.

774
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,869
Soon Young...

775
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,949
Let's pay our respects
to the deceased.

776
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,960
All bow.

777
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,130
Thank you.

778
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:22,599
Anesthesiologist, may I begin?

779
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes, you can begin.

780
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,039
Okay. Then I'll begin.

781
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,469
Scalpel.

782
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,579
I'll administer the anesthesia.

783
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,210
Wait.

784
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Yes?

785
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,320
What? Do you have something to say?

786
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,519
Thank you.

787
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,530
Please tell her I said thanks.

788
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,559
You can tell her yourself...

789
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,329
once you get better.

790
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,630
I'll administer the anesthesia.

791
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,239
Give him 5ml of propofol.

792
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,929
The heart has been disconnected.

793
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,130
Lung team, you may come in.

794
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,300
Scalpel.

795
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,679
Gauze.

796
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,710
Forceps.

797
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:46,449
Bovie.

798
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,289
They'll remove the donor's kidney,

799
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:55,760
so I'll cut down to the iliac fossa.

800
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,789
(Iliac fossa: Room for
the new kidney)

801
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,380
The liver has been removed.

802
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,380
We will now begin the cannulation,
so bring in the thoracic team.

803
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,420
Prepare the perfusate.

804
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,650
Perfusate prepared.

805
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,150
Have the ice on hold.

806
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:28,389
The perfusate is ready,
so you may begin.

807
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:30,260
Then I'll begin.

808
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:34,059
Cutting the aorta.

809
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,639
- Perfusion on.
- Perfusion on.

810
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,579
Perfusion begins at 16:23.

811
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:49,010
16:23.

812
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,650
Dr. Park, are the fluids
being entered properly?

813
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,250
Yes, Master Kim.

814
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:58,590
Removing the heart.

815
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,219
Scissors.

816
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,090
Container, please.

817
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,239
The heart has been removed.

818
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:18,510
Bring in the lung team.

819
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,949
Removing the lung.

820
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,789
The lung has been removed.

821
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,159
The liver team may enter.

822
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,260
The liver has been removed.

823
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,800
The liver has been removed.

824
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,599
Next up are the kidneys.

825
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,139
Long forceps.

826
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,010
Vessel loop, please.

827
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,809
(Vessel loop: Rubber cords that
are used to identify blood vessels)

828
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,610
Please check on the other OR.

829
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:57,980
Yes, doctor.

830
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,719
Sure.

831
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,320
The other OR
is asking about our progress.

832
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,820
Tell them that we've cut
the iliac vessel.

833
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:10,389
The iliac vessel has been cut.

834
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,730
Removing the kidneys.

835
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,360
The container, please.

836
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,269
Here's the right kidney.

837
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,900
The next one
is for our other patient.

838
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,969
Here's the left kidney.

839
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,480
I'll head outside
and clean up its blood vessels.

840
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:33,349
Understood.

841
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,380
The kidney has been removed and the
blood vessels are now being cleaned.

842
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:38,219
Master Kim will be here shortly.

843
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,550
Okay.

844
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,440
Ophthalmology team, you may come in.

845
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,030
(Doldam Hospital)

846
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,340
(Kidneys)

847
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,369
(Eyes, Hanseong Hospital)

848
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,340
(Lung and bowel,
Hana General Hospital)

849
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:21,219
The surgery was a success.

850
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,059
The transplant went without a hitch
and he's urinating properly.

851
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,500
We only need to wait now.

852
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:29,699
I'm glad.

853
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,000
Is something troubling you?

854
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:42,880
I'm always the root of my troubles,
so all I do is worry about myself.

855
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:46,179
Why is that?

856
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,090
I feel like I always find
the wrong answer.

857
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,090
I thought that working hard
was enough,

858
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,889
but that isn't the case.

859
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,599
I believed that I was doing well
by not being a nuisance to anyone,

860
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,230
but that hasn't worked out
for me either.

861
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,739
I've been doing my best,

862
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,369
but I'm not sure
if that's the best...

863
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,170
by everyone's standards.

864
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,949
Could it be because
you're trying to find answers...

865
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:20,079
that have been set by others?

866
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,619
Instead of the answers
that others want,

867
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,019
have you ever thought about
the answers that you want?

868
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,099
Life can be mostly unreasonable,

869
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,300
but knowing the answers I want...

870
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:42,139
makes living in it easier.

871
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:49,679
Please smile.

872
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:51,880
Please look over here.

873
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,019
Let's now look at
the camera on the left.

874
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:19,710
Are you all right?

875
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:21,679
Well,

876
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,179
I guess.

877
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:25,880
What about you?

878
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,250
I...

879
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,420
don't know.

880
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,119
That's perfectly fine.

881
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,530
It's impossible
to know everything anyway.

882
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,559
I didn't run around
advocating for you...

883
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,030
because I like you.

884
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,230
You're my patient.

885
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,069
Whether you're a lifer or not,

886
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,369
you are still my patient.

887
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:23,840
That's why I did my best.

888
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,239
So...

889
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,779
become a model prisoner
when you return.

890
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,609
Become one,

891
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:35,279
receive parole,
come back to society,

892
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:37,420
and be a good son to your mother.

893
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:39,689
Also,

894
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:43,020
try to become as close...

895
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,989
as to having a selfless life
like Ms. Choi's.

896
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,000
Got it?

897
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:00,609
I will relay what you said...

898
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,609
when he wakes up.

899
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,479
Thank you. Good day.

900
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:14,920
One down.

901
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,630
Dr. Yang!

902
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,140
I...

903
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,270
will not leave Doldam.

904
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,310
- What?
- I won't look...

905
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,569
for another place to work at.

906
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:37,979
I don't know why you think
you can be this brazen.

907
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,750
Well, let me apologize
for my attitude then.

908
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:42,649
Still,

909
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:45,289
I feel like I was wronged though.

910
01:09:46,489 --> 01:09:47,960
Even after taking a blade
to my neck,

911
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,619
I sucked it in
and kept working hard.

912
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,789
All I did was do my job,

913
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,229
so why must I move
to another hospital?

914
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,970
- Are you being sassy with me?
- I apologize for that too.

915
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:00,800
However,

916
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:03,640
while I'm at it,
I'll just keep going.

917
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,470
If I move to another hospital
without doing so,

918
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:10,539
I'll be humiliated
and angry about it forever.

919
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,350
I'll probably resent myself.

920
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,010
Are you high or something?

921
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,420
Who do you think
you're talking back to...

922
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,479
You're right.

923
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,920
I'm on drugs.

924
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,430
Thanks to this medication,

925
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,430
I've been able to operate in the OR.

926
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:30,500
So don't you give me an ultimatum...

927
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,369
and tell me to leave.

928
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,899
I refuse to endure
any further threats.

929
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:37,869
Thank you.

930
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:54,920
2 down, 1 to go.

931
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:12,340
What are you doing here alone?

932
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:15,140
Nothing.

933
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,479
I'm going over the organ
transplant surgery I did earlier.

934
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,510
Oh, I see.

935
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,449
My dad is a doctor.

936
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,159
My older brother is also a doctor,
and so is my older sister.

937
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,859
My mom is just a normal housewife.

938
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,170
And her joy in life is
talking to me on the phone.

939
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:42,270
Are you boasting that you're
from a family of doctors?

940
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,539
But among the doctors in our family,
I'm the one who always falls behind.

941
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:49,439
I see.

942
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,310
No wonder you were always obsessed
with getting the best grades.

943
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,619
To be honest,

944
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,489
I was bothered by you
the moment we first met.

945
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,260
Same here.

946
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,260
I was bothered by you too.

947
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,060
You were always so cold to everyone.

948
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,760
You were arrogant and haughty.

949
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,270
You always did things your way.

950
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,470
You put on airs
and was always so mean.

951
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,100
Plus, you thought
you were really good-looking.

952
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:18,210
So you were a pain in the neck.

953
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,369
But...

954
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,810
There's a twist?

955
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,210
But it also...

956
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,119
hurt me a little.

957
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:33,119
Yesterday,

958
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,819
I heard for the first time...

959
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,529
that your parents passed away
when you were young.

960
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:47,029
When I heard that,

961
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:50,670
my heart ached for some reason.

962
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,550
There's no need to feel that way.

963
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:02,319
I'm being really serious right now.

964
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,350
Well, don't be.

965
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:08,960
The moment things become serious,
we'll start to fall apart.

966
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,130
Things will turn
boring and pathetic.

967
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,229
So just forget what you heard.

968
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,329
How do you expect me to forget
what I already heard?

969
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:19,100
I can't just forget everything.

970
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:20,399
Why not?

971
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,100
Do you want me to teach you
once again?

972
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,409
Teach me what?

973
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:26,909
Reset.
