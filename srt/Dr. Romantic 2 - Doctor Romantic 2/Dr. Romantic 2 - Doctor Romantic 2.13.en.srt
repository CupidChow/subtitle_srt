1
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,219
This is the list of people
I've been approaching.

2
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,189
The five at the top
are ready to jump ship.

3
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,820
The others are still
weighing their options.

4
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,590
Most of them will
take the offer though.

5
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,259
Let me add one more name.

6
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,310
Will it be possible?

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,609
Unbelievable. Why is the old man...

8
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,780
obsessed with that hospital anyway?

9
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,409
It's not the hospital,
but the person in it.

10
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,780
Master Kim.

11
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,090
Chairman Do...

12
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,989
has been requesting
a meeting with Chairman Shin.

13
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,519
It seems like
he's working with a giant company...

14
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,060
to push his project forward.

15
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
The directors on the board...

16
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,170
are already mostly on board.

17
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,739
Before it is officially
brought up for a vote,

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,109
we should make our move.

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,810
May I ask why you're being hesitant?

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,480
A particular reason?

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,250
It's the people, I guess.

22
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,560
A hospital can't be run by itself.

23
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,659
It needs doctors
and medical staff...

24
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,829
to properly function.

25
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,129
Dr. Kang Dong Joo
and Dr. Yoon Seo Jung.

26
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,729
Won't they be back in the next year?

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,340
You also have
an orthopedic doctor...

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,400
two new fellows.

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,110
Still,

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,580
they need someone with experience
to guide them.

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,750
And they have you.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,750
Are you saying
they need someone else?

33
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,939
You think you won, don't you?

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,539
Dr. Park.

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,550
Do you head in to surgery
just to beat other doctors?

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,150
That's not the attitude...

37
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,490
a doctor should harbor.

38
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,000
Something about him...

39
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,870
keeps provoking Dr. Park
in some way.

40
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,469
Now, this has become
a matter of pride to him.

41
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,710
Is this Master Kim truly that great?

42
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Come on.

43
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,379
Even Seo Woo Jin has gotten cheeky
now that he's with Master Kim.

44
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,610
There's nothing more
I can do for the old man except...

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,719
So how about it?

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,849
Can you get rid of the jerk?

47
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,060
(Seo Woo Jin)

48
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,439
Are you going to just stand there?

49
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,770
Don't you know it's polite
to greet your elders?

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,139
Save it.

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,750
I'd rather we talk someplace quiet.

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,650
Do you want to cause a fuss,
or will you just quietly follow us?

53
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,110
Can you believe it?

54
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:38,120
They just dragged it away
and then charged me with...

55
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,519
Gosh, look at all these zeroes.

56
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,589
Woo Jin?

57
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,389
Where did he go?

58
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:52,800
Seo Woo Jin?

59
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,269
Woo Jin?

60
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,439
Seo Woo Jin!

61
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,990
(Chapter 13: Defense mechanism)

62
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,189
(11 hours ago)

63
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,930
It's healing nicely.

64
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,399
Of course, it's healing nicely.
You did the stitches.

65
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,970
It's all done.

66
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,240
I'll take out the stitches
after 3 to 4 days.

67
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,300
Okay, sir.

68
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,610
- How is your wrist?
- It's fine.

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,709
And your elbow?

70
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,339
That's fine too.

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,449
When are you going to fix a date
for your CTS surgery?

72
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,779
The OS department
will take care of that.

73
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,449
Can you tell me the date as well?

74
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,620
After all, I'm your doctor.

75
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,629
My doctor?

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,230
Yes, I'm your doctor
until I take out your stitches.

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,430
Are you bored these days?

78
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,439
No, I'm not bored.
I'm worried as your doctor.

79
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,910
How long are you going to
stay out of the OR?

80
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,050
I'll take care of that issue.

81
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,810
That's between me and Dr. Park.

82
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,519
When you have time,

83
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:25,689
you should study
as many medical cases as you can.

84
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,389
A surgeon who's on a break
should always be ready...

85
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,360
to go back to the OR.
Do you understand?

86
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,230
Yes.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll be off now.

88
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,399
Bye.

89
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,620
Have you arranged the schedule
for the Whipple's operation?

90
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,620
Well, the thing is,

91
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,319
Dr. Shim hasn't confirmed
the surgery yet.

92
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,699
Do I also need to take care
of the OP booking now?

93
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,360
No, sir.

94
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,430
I'll deal with it, sir.

95
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,170
Where is Dr. Shim?

96
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,839
What's the problem, Dr. Shim?

97
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,709
Why haven't you arranged surgery
for Kang Ik Joon yet?

98
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,389
I already told him
that he can get surgery today.

99
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,519
Something bothers me.

100
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,560
What do you mean?

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,290
The operation laboratory tests
came out fine.

102
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,389
But his EKG is what bothers me.

103
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,029
What's wrong with the EKG?

104
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,160
It looks like he has WPW syndrome.

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,500
"WPW"?

106
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,029
"WPW"?

107
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,939
I think we should operate on him
after consulting an internist.

108
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,209
Call the internal
medicine department.

109
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,250
Okay, sir.

110
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,089
Hello, sir. It's Yang Ho Jun.

111
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,990
I'm sure you already know
how much this surgery means to me.

112
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,560
Yes, I know.

113
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,430
That's why I think
we should be careful.

114
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,250
My gosh, I must be nuts.
I can't believe I woke up so late.

115
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,009
What is the matter with me?

116
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,819
I even set two alarms.

117
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,690
But I can't believe
I ignored both of them.

118
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
Have you ever operated
on a patient with WPW syndrome?

119
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,460
Yes, just once.

120
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,690
We operated after the patient
checked with a cardiologist,

121
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,659
took an EP study, and received
an ablation procedure. Why?

122
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,730
Does someone have WPW syndrome?

123
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,669
I think Dr. Park's VIP patient...

124
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,669
has that syndrome.

125
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,700
Let's go out on a date.

126
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,509
I need to go. Let's talk later.

127
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,809
Hey, wait.

128
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,950
What?

129
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,250
Do I have sleep in my eyes again?

130
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,460
Hope you have a good day.

131
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,299
My gosh, I'm running late.

132
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,299
You too, Woo Jin.
I hope you also have a good day.

133
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,129
What kind of patient is it?

134
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,159
Incoming!

135
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,370
Take him to the hybrid room.

136
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,110
- How are his vitals?
- 100 over 70. 140bpm.

137
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,279
Let's move the patient. 1, 2, 3.

138
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,750
Set up IV lines
and run operation laboratory tests.

139
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,580
And ask for
two packed red blood cells.

140
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,590
- Okay.
- Is everything else fine...

141
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,690
other than his leg?

142
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,419
Yes, his leg got amputated
by a cutter in the factory.

143
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,289
His colleagues tried
to stop the bleeding with a belt.

144
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,059
So thankfully,
he didn't bleed out too much.

145
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,759
Let's just leave the belt.

146
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm sorry I'm late.

147
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,570
Get me a gauze
and some dry dressings.

148
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,639
Okay.

149
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,889
What should we do
with the amputated leg?

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,019
Mr. Park, please take the stump.

151
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,320
Okay. Let me take that.

152
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,429
Cool the resection margin first.
Then cover it with gauze...

153
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,860
dipped in saline
so that it doesn't dry up.

154
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,500
- Okay.
- Mr. Park, I'll help.

155
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,769
His vitals?

156
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,440
100 over 60. 135bpm.

157
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,039
Give him 5mm of morphine.

158
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,610
Okay.

159
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,950
Sir, please wait for a little.

160
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,720
We'll give you morphine.
Hang in there.

161
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,960
Dr. Bae, how is the patient?

162
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,559
It's a thigh amputation.

163
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,129
He needs to get surgery right away.

164
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,330
Mr. Heo, does he work
at the factory?

165
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,629
- Yes.
- Did you call his guardian?

166
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:35,769
The guardian is on the way.

167
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,870
Okay.

168
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,200
I want CS...

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,470
to get involved in this.

170
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:44,309
Dr. Bae, call Anesthesiology,

171
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,610
and get ready for surgery.

172
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,649
Okay.

173
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,179
We'll perform a bone fixation
on his supine position first,

174
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:52,350
and make him get cardiovascular
surgery on his prone position.

175
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,389
Ms. Oh, please take his x-ray.

176
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,919
- Okay.
- Sir.

177
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,759
Let me take a look at your wound.

178
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,620
Ms. Oh, get me a pair of forceps
and some gauze.

179
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,100
Cover it with the gauze.

180
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,850
What do you want?

181
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,980
I'm not a cardiologist.

182
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,820
So I can't calculate the OP risk.

183
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,090
So what?

184
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,389
What should we do?

185
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,460
I think we should
further study his condition.

186
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,230
We're not well-equipped,

187
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,730
so you should send him
to the main hospital.

188
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,460
But he purposely came
all the way here...

189
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,230
just to get surgery.

190
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,629
Wouldn't it be rude to send him back
to the main hospital?

191
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,600
Well, you do have a point.

192
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,470
Then what do you think we should do?

193
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,440
Well...

194
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,279
He didn't show
any particular symptoms.

195
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,210
And he's been doing fine until now.

196
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,750
And because he's so young,

197
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,080
the cancer is spreading very quickly
and aggressively.

198
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,649
It's only been a month,
but it already spread...

199
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,220
to his biliary tract
and transverse colon.

200
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,889
Either way, we'll be taking a risk.

201
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,730
I guess you're right.

202
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,799
Let's do this.

203
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,330
Let's take him
to the main hospital...

204
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
and study his condition
after we complete his surgery.

205
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,539
What do you say?

206
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,970
Pardon?

207
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,580
I'll refer to your note...

208
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,389
and discuss the matter
with the anesthesiologist.

209
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,659
You may leave.

210
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,059
What do you want?

211
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,200
We have an acute
appendicitis patient.

212
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,169
He needs surgery right away.
What should we do?

213
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:51,470
Hey, why are you asking him?

214
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,940
He's busy with his VIP patients.

215
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,940
Why don't you go ask Master Kim?

216
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,179
He's treating a patient
with an amputated leg...

217
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,009
and is planning
to do surgery with OS.

218
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,450
If you'll lift my surgery ban,
I'll go in.

219
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,919
Dr. Yang, you do it.

220
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,190
- Me?
- It doesn't take that long.

221
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,889
You do it.

222
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes, sir.

223
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,889
I'll call Anesthesiology.

224
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,639
What do you mean?

225
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,509
We can't use OR 1?

226
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,110
Dr. Park told us to
keep OR 1 free...

227
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,639
at all times in case of VIP surgery.

228
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,679
Even if it's the president's order,
this is an OR.

229
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,279
You can't stop
an anesthesiologist from going in.

230
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,919
I know that.

231
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,090
But it's the president's order.

232
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,659
Take OR 2.

233
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:45,919
It's a thigh amputation,

234
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,190
and that requires
a precise operation.

235
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,129
We need the machinery in OR 1.

236
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,629
Don't you get what I mean?

237
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,159
I do.

238
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,370
But what can I do?
It's the president's order.

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,870
Take OR 2.

240
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,240
I'm taking OR 2.

241
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,980
The VIP needs more tests...

242
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,179
and his surgery will be delayed,
just so you know.

243
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,080
- But...
- Acute appendicitis case.

244
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,610
To OR 2.

245
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,460
Even with the president's orders,
opening the OR...

246
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,289
is up to Anesthesiology.

247
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,159
You crossed the line.

248
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,460
Do you understand?

249
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,029
What?

250
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,039
Dr. Shim did that?

251
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,269
What should I do?

252
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,409
I should tell Dr. Park, right?

253
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,809
Darn it.

254
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,409
Let's deal with the acute
appendicitis patient first.

255
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,320
Nothing good will come
from telling him now. Okay?

256
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,389
What?

257
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,419
The patient's refusing surgery?

258
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,690
Why?

259
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,659
I think it's because of
the medical bill?

260
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,029
The medical bill?

261
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,129
Sticking my leg back on...

262
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,269
doesn't mean
I'll have full use of it.

263
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,710
Without a guarantee
that I'll fully recover,

264
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,179
must I go through
with expensive surgery?

265
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,009
If it's an industrial accident,
you will be compensated somewhat.

266
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,049
Even if it's ruled
an industrial accident,

267
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,690
I'll still have to pay
a hefty chunk of the bill.

268
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,990
I don't have that much money.

269
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,100
Mr. Park.

270
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,559
No one came from the factory?

271
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,200
No. No one
from management is here yet.

272
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,710
A man is that badly hurt.

273
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,610
How come no one's here yet? Darn it.

274
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm here for Lee Dong Woo.

275
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,490
Are you Mr. Lee's wife?

276
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,329
Yes. He's my husband. Where is he?

277
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,500
I was told he hurt his leg.

278
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,700
Is it bad?

279
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,690
What now?

280
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,960
What should we do now?

281
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,940
- Seung Hee.
- What now?

282
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,240
I told you to be careful.

283
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,450
I told you to watch out!

284
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,279
What will you do now?

285
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,920
What should we do about this now?

286
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,490
What should we do?

287
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,490
How are we to live?
What will happen to you?

288
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,490
- What now?
- I was...

289
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,829
just not careful enough.

290
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Honey.

291
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,099
How could this happen?

292
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,109
What should we do?

293
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,380
What are we to do now?

294
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,420
What can we do?

295
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
What now?

296
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,759
Why is my mom crying?

297
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,369
Your dad was badly hurt.

298
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,839
I think your mom's in shock.

299
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,440
Shall we wait outside?

300
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,170
I have a lollipop.

301
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,509
Why is my mom crying?

302
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,390
Ma'am. Crying won't
provide us with a solution.

303
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,460
Mr. Lee. You need surgery.

304
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,200
What? Surgery?

305
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,599
- Surgery?
- Yes.

306
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,940
Then can he get his leg back?

307
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,539
I can't get it back.

308
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,779
Even if they put it back on,

309
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,309
it won't recover 100 percent.

310
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,450
Your determination...

311
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,250
will affect
the percentage of recovery.

312
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,849
What if the surgery is a failure...

313
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,690
and the leg rots?

314
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,690
You said then
it has to come back off.

315
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,930
That means yet another operation.

316
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,299
I'm sorry, but I can't
go through with that.

317
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,940
I can't spend
tens of thousands of dollars...

318
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,609
into surgery that might not work.

319
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,440
And I can't deal with the finances
after spending that.

320
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,710
So because of money,

321
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,619
you'll give up a leg?

322
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,680
What should we do?

323
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,779
This is...

324
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,950
the hand I was dealt with.

325
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,759
I was given a rotten hand in life.

326
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:56,359
I have no choice.

327
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,529
Listen to me.

328
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,970
Your son is out there
hearing all this.

329
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,940
How can you say that
and call yourself a father?

330
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,609
If you blame your life and luck,

331
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,609
do you think someone will
take pity on you?

332
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,250
The world doesn't care for people
who give up on their own.

333
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,619
It's not just the world.

334
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,250
Your son...

335
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,849
will see, remember,
and learn this lesson.

336
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,059
That everything's
up to luck and life.

337
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
That you can do nothing about it.

338
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,759
Even if you lose a leg, you have
no choice because you're poor.

339
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,470
He'll remember you
as a father who just gives up!

340
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,609
Don't yell at my dad!

341
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,779
My dad's in pain!

342
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,109
Don't scold him!

343
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,319
Don't cry.

344
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,190
Your son is better than you.

345
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,930
Come to me. Come here.

346
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,539
What should we do?

347
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,160
It's all my fault.

348
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

349
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,170
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,539
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

351
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,210
How far...

352
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,250
must we treat a patient?

353
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,599
How deep...

355
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,569
must we look for their wounds?

356
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,519
(Operating Room 1,
Operating Room 2)

357
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,900
This is a thigh amputation.

358
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,640
Master Kim will join us later
to help with the vascular surgery.

359
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,609
Can I begin?

360
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,180
Yes. You can begin.

361
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,180
Keep track of the tourniquet time.

362
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,309
Yes, doctor.

363
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,619
We'll use the plate
to fixate the bone.

364
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,019
Let's start with the reduction.

365
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,019
(Reduction:
correcting bone alignment)

366
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,190
Self retractor.

367
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,759
One more, please.

368
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:20,460
The bone holding clamp.

369
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:32,509
(Operating Room 1,
Operating Room 2)

370
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,750
- What now?
- Another patient needs surgery.

371
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,079
Another? What is it this time?

372
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,390
Appendicitis.

373
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,720
Again?

374
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,589
I just took care of one
with appendicitis.

375
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:46,619
I said
it's an appendicitis patient...

376
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,490
because it's
an appendicitis patient.

377
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,190
I don't have an answer
for why that is.

378
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,960
It's not like I went out
looking for an appendicitis patient.

379
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:59,970
There are odd days like this.

380
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,400
Anyway, I'll start prepping.

381
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,740
Hey, must I be wasting my time
on appendicitis patients?

382
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,910
I have enough on my plate
with the VIP's Whipple procedure.

383
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,779
It's not me
who you should be complaining to.

384
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,289
You annoying little...

385
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,789
Yes, doctor.

386
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,660
Dr. Yang, it's President Park.

387
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,299
Put me on speaker, please.

388
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
Yes, doctor. It's me.

389
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,170
Have you confirmed with the
internist on Mr. Kang's surgery?

390
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,170
Well, the thing is,

391
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm still in surgery.

392
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,609
An appendicitis
shouldn't take this long!

393
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,710
Actually,

394
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,779
another patient with appendicitis
came in.

395
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm on my second
appendicitis patient.

396
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,920
Dr. Yang didn't have a choice.

397
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,559
You're the one
who banned Dr. Seo from the OR.

398
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,730
He seems furious.

399
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,230
You don't know the half of it.

400
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,500
He's been constantly on my case.

401
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,480
Yes, Dr. Na. It's me.

402
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,079
When you're done consulting,
don't bother contacting Dr. Yang.

403
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,720
Send the report to me directly.
Right now.

404
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,759
Yes?

405
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,660
This is Seo Woo Jin.

406
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,289
Another trauma patient just came in.

407
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,299
He dropped from a ladder...

408
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,059
and is showing signs
of an abdomen blunt injury.

409
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,130
After the CT scan,
he'll need immediate surgery.

410
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,839
Should I have Dr. Yang
take the patient...

411
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,309
or would you like
to operate on him yourself?

412
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,309
Understood, sir.
I'll assign him to Dr. Yang.

413
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,890
Dr. Seo, you're more tenacious
than I gave you credit for.

414
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,460
Me?

415
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,829
You're provoking President Park
on purpose.

416
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,500
What else can I do?

417
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,869
Trauma patients keep coming in
and I can't stand by and do nothing.

418
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,079
Call it a one-man strike.

419
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,380
You're hoping that
he'll finally cave in?

420
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,950
It's more like
I won't stop until he does.

421
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,490
- Dr. Yun.
- Yes?

422
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,319
Take the abdomen injury patient
to get a CT scan...

423
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,890
and prep him for emergency surgery.

424
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,390
I'll notify OR 2.

425
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,430
Yes, doctor.

426
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,460
Dr. Seo, it's for you.

427
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,599
It's President Park.

428
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,670
Take that one.

429
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,880
This is Seo Woo Jin.

430
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,309
It's only until I'm done
with the surgery on my VIP patient.

431
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,250
The trauma patients
will be yours to operate on.

432
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,250
You will no longer
pester and bother my teammates.

433
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,190
Understood?

434
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,859
No way.

435
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,730
I'll get prepped for surgery then.

436
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,740
He truly has changed, hasn't he?

437
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,539
I don't remember him
to be that easy with smiles.

438
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,579
Doldam Hospital
must be growing on him.

439
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,759
Bring over the C-arm.

440
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,029
C-arm on.

441
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,109
Okay, the bones
seem to be in alignment.

442
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,309
The six-hole plate, please.

443
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,420
Guide pin.

444
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,490
Drill.

445
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,430
C-arm on.

446
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,960
On.

447
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,470
Master Kim,
I have something to ask.

448
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,509
Yes?

449
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,440
You see, I emptied the medicine
you prescribed me.

450
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,180
The medicine?

451
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,779
You know,

452
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,119
the one you prescribed
for my nausea.

453
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,650
Right. And?

454
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,950
If you hand me the prescription,
I'll...

455
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,990
A prescription isn't needed.

456
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,190
You've been taking
pancreatic enzymes.

457
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,289
Sorry?

458
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,900
Pancreatic enzymes?

459
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,230
Pills for indigestion?

460
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,099
Yes.

461
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,410
Let me get this straight,
Master Kim.

462
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,950
So the pills I've been taking
for my nausea...

463
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:12,819
were indigestion pills?

464
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,549
Yes, that's right.

465
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,660
Sorry about that.

466
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,759
I'm famished lately
whenever I come into the OR.

467
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,470
Gosh, I'm hungry.

468
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,140
Still, how could you
give me pancreatic enzymes?

469
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,619
Eun Jae, have a seat.

470
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,490
I consulted a specialist I know
in neuropsychiatry about your case.

471
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,900
The doctor suggested that...

472
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,400
you were dealing
with too much pressure.

473
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,130
Wanting to be better...

474
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,769
would swallow you whole
especially in tight spaces.

475
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,039
The doctor said that your body...

476
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,240
was only kicking into defense.

477
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,210
Eun Jae,

478
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,420
there's no need for you
to feel pressured anymore.

479
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,519
You've been doing well...

480
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,759
and I'm sure you'll keep
doing great work.

481
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,660
Don't you agree?

482
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,670
What are you doing here?

483
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,009
Eun Jae?

484
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,410
They were pancreatic enzymes.

485
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,420
What was?

486
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,990
The medicine Master Kim
prescribed me for my nausea.

487
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,490
They were pills for indigestion.

488
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,630
No wonder.

489
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,259
Now I get why I was
always hungry in the OR.

490
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,170
I'm not the type
to binge-eat at night,

491
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:13,970
but...

492
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,369
I've been taking digestive medicine.

493
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,279
What now?

494
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,779
What else?
Just do what you've been doing.

495
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,720
What you believed in
weren't those pills anyway.

496
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,819
What do you mean?

497
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,490
The answer should be yours
to figure out.

498
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,900
Bone tap, please.

499
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,140
The 36mm locking screw.

500
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,789
What I believed in...

501
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,299
weren't the pills?

502
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,130
What else can it be?

503
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,599
What are you up to?
Are you on your break?

504
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,609
I have no time to babysit.

505
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,440
These are macaroons from Seoul.

506
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,779
Do you want some?

507
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,180
I can't since I have to be NPO.

508
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:34,950
My head's spinning as is,
so don't make it worse.

509
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,329
Dr. Park.

510
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm back. Unbelievable.

511
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,109
Trauma patients were flooding in...

512
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,509
Dr. Na sent his consultation report.

513
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,109
Take it and discuss the details
with Dr. Shim...

514
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,950
and make sure that
we can operate on him today.

515
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,349
Yes, sir.

516
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,679
(Medical Consultation Report)

517
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,219
But Dr. Park,

518
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,590
Dr. Shim just went
into another surgery.

519
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,929
Don't worry about it, sir.

520
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll confirm the schedule
as soon as possible.

521
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,570
OR 1 is still vacant, right?

522
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,340
Actually,

523
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,940
there was a patient
with an amputated thigh.

524
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,679
It required an intricate surgery...

525
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,639
and the tools in OR 1.

526
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,409
Mr. Heo and I were against it,

527
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,949
but Master Kim forced his way in.

528
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:41,719
Are you...

529
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,289
more afraid of Dr. Boo?

530
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,349
Sorry?

531
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,090
No, of course not, sir.

532
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,130
That is not the case.

533
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,429
When will you finally
stop disappointing me?

534
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm sorry, sir.

535
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,670
I'll straighten it out right away.

536
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,039
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

537
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,619
What is it Dr. Yang?

538
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,659
Could you come out here
for a second?

539
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,500
The IN doctor just sent over
his consultation report.

540
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,070
Can't you see that I'm in surgery,
Dr. Yang?

541
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,369
I only need five minutes.

542
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,610
Dr. Park is fuming.

543
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,809
It'll take me more than five minutes
to look over anyway.

544
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,380
Wait until I'm done.

545
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:42,579
But Dr. Shim...

546
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,360
I spot another bleeding.

547
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,699
You checked all the blood vessels.

548
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,300
Could it be the spleen?

549
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,900
I don't think so.

550
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,769
The diaphragm is torn.

551
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:09,769
(Diaphragm: thin muscle
at the base of the chest)

552
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,679
Dr. Seo?

553
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,750
Dr. Seo, not again...

554
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,889
What? A torn diaphragm?

555
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,559
I was treating
an abdomen blunt injury patient...

556
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,599
for a rupture in his large bowel,

557
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:38,000
but I spotted a tear
in his diaphragm.

558
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,469
Can you scrub in, Dr. Cha?

559
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,239
Are you kidding me?

560
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,139
You had to ask me that right now?

561
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,480
You're on speaker
and everyone's listening.

562
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,050
Look here, Dr. Seo.

563
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,119
What kind of show
are you wishing to see?

564
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,590
Must you see me
pass out in the OR again?

565
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:02,860
Don't worry.

566
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,030
I'll carry you out on my back again.

567
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,099
Where's your confidence?

568
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,940
You've successfully performed
many cases of surgery already.

569
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,670
You saved a patient
from a penetrating trauma in the ER,

570
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,210
successfully performed
the artery bypass,

571
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
and saved a man
with an umbrella stuck in his lung.

572
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,510
Yesterday, you led
the CABG case yourself.

573
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,150
Is there really anything
you're still afraid of, Dr. Cha?

574
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:33,889
So what I trusted
and believed was...

575
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,300
The Runner did a good job
on the emergency procedure.

576
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,530
There's no need
to seek my confirmation.

577
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,599
This is your operation.
Do what you think is right.

578
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,309
You have five minutes to decide.

579
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,409
I'll wait for you, Dr. Cha.

580
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,510
Please hang up.

581
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,130
Shouldn't you get going?

582
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,989
It seems like you're needed.

583
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:23,210
Dr. Seo, it's been
almost five minutes.

584
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,679
You should stop the bleeding
and close him up.

585
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,079
That's a first.

586
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,650
Ms. Oh and I agree on something.

587
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,309
She's right, Dr. Seo.

588
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,579
Wrap this up already.

589
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,650
Dr. Seo.

590
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,730
Suture, please.

591
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,159
Wait, it's Dr. Cha.

592
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,199
It ruptured due to the pressure
that was built up in his abdomen.

593
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,000
I think I already said this,

594
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,599
but isn't this something
a GS surgeon can do?

595
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,269
Yes, I can.

596
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
What?

597
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,239
This is my way of telling you
not to be afraid.

598
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:33,380
Whether you get a panic attack,
run out after vomiting,

599
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,610
or pass out,

600
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,349
I'll back you up.

601
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,190
Suture, please.

602
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,010
Focus.

603
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,960
- Cut.
- Cut.

604
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,230
Cut.

605
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,099
Cut.

606
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,239
We have bleeding.

607
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,139
Is it a clot?

608
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,079
No, there seems
to be another origin.

609
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
Scissors.

610
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,860
He has a blunt injury, right?

611
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,800
He crashed onto a rail
after falling off a ladder.

612
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,369
- On his chest wall?
- No.

613
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,429
Slightly left to his umbilicus,

614
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,199
so I doubt his chest
received any trauma.

615
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,539
I don't feel any injury
along the chest wall.

616
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,869
It's an abdomen blunt injury,

617
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,809
so I doubt
it's an issue with his lungs.

618
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,380
- The phrenic vessel.
- The phrenic vessel.

619
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,119
(Phrenic vessel:
a blood vessel on the diaphragm)

620
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,960
Found it. It was the phrenic vessel.

621
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,000
Suture, please.

622
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,929

Cut.

625
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,130
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

626
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,769
- They're ready for you.
- Okay.

627
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,639
My gosh, you startled me.

628
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,670
What are you doing here?

629
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:21,480
Pardon? I'm waiting for Dr. Shim.

630
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,409
- Are you sick?
- Pardon?

631
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,219
No, I'm fine.

632
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,190
Go to the ER and ask Dr. Jung
to check your condition.

633
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,059
You don't look very well.

634
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,500
Go on. Get going.

635
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,400
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

636
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,949
- Cut.
- Cut.

637
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,780
Dr. Seo, you can wrap up.

638
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,190
Do you have a prior commitment?

639
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,789
Yes, I need to go to OR 1.

640
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,590
- Good work.
- You too.

641
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,030
Good work.

642
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,309
I'll wrap up. Suture, please.

643
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm sorry I'm late.

644
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:30,650
You shouldn't have come at all
if you were going to be so late.

645
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,110
Why did you even bother?

646
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm a cardiologist.
I should be here.

647
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,349
From now on,

648
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,389
I'm going to attend
all your operations.

649
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,420
My goodness, you're very eager.

650
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,659
I like it.

651
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,159
Eun Jae.

652
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,500
Will you be okay?

653
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,369
Of course.
I just operated on someone already.

654
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,769
I'll be fine.

655
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,880
Okay. Attention, everyone.

656
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,619
Despite his difficult situation,
this patient...

657
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:09,690
still decided to get an operation.

658
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:13,489
Let's do our best
so he can walk again.

659
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:14,760
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.

660
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,530
Okay then.

661
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,760
Let's start with the artery.

662
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,059
Irrigation.

663
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,239
Sponge stick.

664
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:30,610
Suture.

665
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:44,550
Cut.

666
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,949
Cut.

667
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,389
- Cut.
- Cut.

668
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,610
What brings you
here without calling?

669
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,940
No reason.

670
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,280
I was passing by,
and I thought I'd come visit.

671
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,849
Please take a seat.

672
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,280
No, I don't want to waste your time.

673
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,889
I heard the second son
of Sejin Group's chairman is here.

674
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,190
Yes, that's correct.

675
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,659
Did you arrange the schedule?

676
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,860
I'm discussing it with Dr. Shim.

677
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,469
I guess...

678
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:10,539
you prefer to keep things
to yourself.

679
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,980
I was going to tell you...

680
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,679
after I completed the surgery.

681
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,820
I really hope
this surgery goes well.

682
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,960
I'm not sure if you know.

683
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,530
But Sejin Group
has a very close relationship...

684
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,630
with our foundation.

685
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,380
- Dr. Yun.
- Yes?

686
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,809
What are you reading?

687
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,079
I'll be taking
my medical board exam soon.

688
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,250
So I'm procrastinating.

689
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,489
Will you go back to the main
hospital if you pass the test?

690
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,019
I'm not sure.
I haven't thought of that.

691
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,659
You can't go anywhere.

692
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,929
You're totally fit for
Doldam Hospital.

693
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,000
Really?

694
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,960
Thank you.

695
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,500
- Do you think that's a compliment?
- What?

696
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,110
Here.

697
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,010
Aren't you tired?
Have a drink, ladies.

698
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,679
What is all this, Manager Jang?

699
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,280
I feel like I haven't been
very attentive to the ER staff.

700
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:28,280
Go ahead and have a drink.

701
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

702
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,019
By the way,
is everything okay these days?

703
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,289
What do you mean?

704
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,329
Well...

705
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,230
Has anyone dropped by
to check on you guys?

706
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,969
Or has anyone approached you...

707
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,699
and talked about a job position
at a different hospital?

708
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,010
What? Do you mean that guy
named Im Hyun Joon?

709
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,280
I saw him again earlier today.

710
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,780
Really? Where did you see him?

711
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,480
Well, I don't think...

712
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,460
My goodness, that's Dr. Jung.

713
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,360
Unbelievable.

714
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:13,599
Has he convinced Dr. Jung already?

715
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,460
Darn it.

716
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,929
Here is the contract
that they gave me.

717
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,369
Give it a read.

718
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,769
Then sign it,
and give it to me by tomorrow.

719
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,250
You're getting everything you asked,

720
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,250
so you should just sign it.

721
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,019
You know this kind of chance
will never come again.

722
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,349
Dr. Jung.

723
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:40,760
Yes?

724
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,400
What are you doing here?

725
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,230
Well, I'm...

726
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,599
I asked him where the men's room is.

727
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,570
(Toilet)

728
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,909
It's right there.

729
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:00,780
Gosh, look at the time.

730
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,980
I'll be off now.

731
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,949
Hey, listen.

732
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,349
Do you think
I don't know who you are?

733
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,260
Your name is Im Hyun Joon.

734
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,190
And I know you're
trying to steal our staff...

735
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,329
by offering them twice their wage.

736
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:21,500
My goodness, you know that already?

737
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,630
You really are amazing,
Manager Jang Gi Tae.

738
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,769
What?

739
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:28,170
How do you know my name?

740
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,039
How could I not?

741
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,039
You're legendary
in this field of business.

742
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,940
"Legendary"?

743
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,309
Me?

744
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,519
Doldam Hospital is
running at a deficit.

745
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,679
The only reason it still exists...

746
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,250
is all thanks
to your managing skills.

747
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,960
Everyone knows that already.

748
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,659
Didn't you know?

749
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,230
No, not at all.

750
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:57,769
To be honest,

751
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,500
I feel uneasy to say this myself.

752
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,369
But it's not entirely wrong.

753
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:11,280
So I've been thinking...

754
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,980
Should I introduce you
to a decent job in Seoul?

755
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,090
What? Me?

756
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,059
Once people find out
that you're on the market,

757
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,289
they'll go crazy to hire you.

758
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,099
Really?

759
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:33,170
If you're interested,
give me a call.

760
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,670
(Lim Hyun Joon)

761
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,570
I'll find you a decent job.

762
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,789
(Operating Room 1)

763
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,500
I don’t think you can file
for an industrial accident.

764
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,869
But the doctor told me earlier...

765
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,809
that the factory will help us
file for an industrial accident.

766
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,469
He even agreed to write
a doctor's note regarding the issue.

767
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,639
That kind of stuff is useless.

768
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,349
Listen. Why don't you...

769
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,750
just settle it with
company insurance?

770
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,079
Company insurance?

771
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,289
What do you mean?

772
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:30,159
It means the factory
will compensate.

773
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:33,230
Industrial accidents are
taken care of by the government.

774
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,300
But if you do as I say,
the factory will take care of it.

775
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,869
But they're pretty much the same.

776
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,539
Really?
I've never heard of it before.

777
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,539
Let's be realistic here.
We're not even a main contractor.

778
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:46,980
We're pretty much
in the very bottom line.

779
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,179
It's hard to get
an industrial accident ruling.

780
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,980
That's why we rely on
company insurance.

781
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:56,380
Like you said,
there's always a solution.

782
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,219
Even if it's ruled
an industrial accident,

783
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:01,159
the payout won't be much different.

784
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,460
Hospitals aren't a charity.

785
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,360
Expensive procedures
aren't covered by insurance.

786
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,730
In the end,
they just take money from...

787
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,469
poor people like us.

788
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:12,800
Do you get what I'm saying?

789
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,409
- Doctor.
- Hello.

790
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,280
Is my husband out of surgery?

791
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,710
Yes. We just moved him to the ICU.

792
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,650
The surgery went well.
Let's see how he does.

793
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,349
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,619
Is this gentleman from the factory?

795
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:35,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

796
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,929
I'm the factory's head manager.

797
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:39,260
Don't listen to him.

798
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,659
He's barking mad.

799
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,130
- Pardon?
- What?

800
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,000
As I explained before the surgery,

801
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,539
your husband suffered nerve damage,

802
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,440
and we don't know
what disability he'll be left with.

803
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,110
That's why you must apply for
industrial accident coverage now...

804
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:58,210
to get compensated depending on
the severity of his disability.

805
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,250
If you settle it with the factory,
they most likely won't offer that.

806
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,920
We're a subsidiary of a subsidiary.

807
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,760
Industrial accidents
don't apply to us.

808
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,889
My goodness.

809
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,760
What do you mean
that doesn't apply to you?

810
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,000
Death or any injury or illness that
takes over three days to treat...

811
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
can be compensated for
by industrial accident coverage.

812
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,300
That's what the law says.

813
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,869
Let's be honest. You just
don't want to bother with it.

814
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:26,309
Because if you make a claim,

815
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,340
your premium goes up
and your factory loses points.

816
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,750
What are you talking about?

817
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,750
Seung Hee. That's not true at all.

818
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,019
I thought you wouldn't know
much about this,

819
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,519
and came here to
explain other options.

820
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,789
If you persuade
this clueless woman...

821
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:45,730
to contact your insurance company
and you get caught,

822
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:48,760
do you know the fine for that
is 15,000 dollars?

823
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,670
If you can afford that,

824
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,800
give it to the injured worker
to cheer him up.

825
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,170
How dare you try to be sly?

826
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,170
How could you do that?
You should be ashamed.

827
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,940
How dare you say that?

828
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm being sly?

829
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:05,409
When did I try to be sly?

830
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,519
Then what? Were you
trying to be smart?

831
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:10,989
What? Smart?

832
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,250
Listen, doctor.

833
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:16,389
How old are you?

834
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,630
How dare you talk to me like that?

835
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,159
A man was hurt!

836
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,159
You should at least do your duty...

837
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,239
and then explain
the company's circumstances.

838
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,110
You must be a husband
and father yourself!

839
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,840
If you don't feel pity,

840
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,380
then at least try to pretend
you're sorry.

841
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:37,610
And what?

842
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:41,349
Why did you ask how old I am?

843
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,579
Me?

844
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,889
I was born on November 3, 1964.

845
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,619
My gosh. I don't believe
I'm saying this.

846
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,989
My gosh. Darn it all.

847
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,699
My goodness.

848
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,170
Drink it. It's yours.
You must be hungry.

849
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,809
I'm sorry I yelled earlier.

850
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,150
I yelled out of concern
for your dad.

851
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,989
I was frustrated
that he was refusing surgery.

852
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:52,619
Well,

853
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,659
Mom sometimes yells at him too.

854
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,829
For being frustrating.

855
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,429
I see.

856
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,199
Mister.

857
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,900
What?

858
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:10,710
Are you a good surgeon?

859
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:13,409
Yes.

860
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,579
I am pretty good when I'm...

861
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,719
in surgery.

862
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:25,849
That's good, then.

863
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,639
You were hungry.

864
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,429
You should say hello
if you noticed someone.

865
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,800
We're not exactly close enough
to say hi when we meet.

866
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,900
How's your wrist?

867
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,969
I heard it's bothering you.

868
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,179
We're definitely not close enough
to ask about such things.

869
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,280
You're getting along with Dr. Park?

870
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,190
That guy is...

871
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,860
more close-minded than he looks
and can be frustrating.

872
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,860
I wonder if you have any problems.

873
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:39,889
Does he know that...

874
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,860
you talk about him behind his back?

875
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:47,099
The VIP patient staying here.

876
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,239
Geodae Foundation considers him
a very important client.

877
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,780
Take a bit more interest
as head of surgery.

878
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,849
I'm sure President Park
is doing what he must.

879
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,280
It's his patient.

880
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,590
You know, principled
and inflexible people like him...

881
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,590
tend to mess up big time
whenever they do.

882
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,889
That sounds like
you want him to mess up.

883
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,699
Would I now?

884
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,230
I'm just being concerned.

885
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:21,300
See you around.

886
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,739
Oh, right.

887
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,809
Give Ms. Jo...

888
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,309
my regards.

889
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,809
Here's the internist's answer.

890
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,980
You can see that it says...

891
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,179
he recommends further tests
after the operation.

892
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,349
That's the answer.

893
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,420
Isn't Dr. Na a pulmonologist
and not a cardiologist?

894
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,449
Pardon?

895
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:15,889
Well, yes.

896
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:19,159
But it's the same internal medicine.

897
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,969
Can't you please
just schedule the surgery?

898
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:26,599
You know something bad happens...

899
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:28,239
when you ignore a nagging feeling.

900
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,010
You know how sensitive
Dr. Park has been lately.

901
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,440
Only too well.

902
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,610
He lost his composure
which isn't at all...

903
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,510
like the Dr. Park we know.

904
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,349
He's so anxious that
he just won't listen.

905
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,820
Exactly.

906
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:47,190
He's killing me.
I'm dying over here.

907
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,659
Save me, Dr. Shim.

908
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,389
Schedule the surgery.

909
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,829
What if it were Dr. Seo...

910
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,369
and not you standing there?

911
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,599
What?

912
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,070
He'd try to persuade me
not to do this surgery.

913
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,340
Dr. Shim.

914
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:09,079
What now?
Shall I talk to Dr. Park...

915
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:10,780
or will you tell him?

916
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,949
Tell him what?

917
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:13,780
That I oppose this surgery.

918
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,480
I have a bad feeling about it.

919
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,389
(Park Min Guk)

920
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,760
So what?

921
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,690
She didn't schedule the surgery?

922
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,260
The thing is,
Dr. Shim's being stubborn.

923
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,360
What on earth...

924
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,500
did you do today, Dr. Yang?

925
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,829
I'm sorry.

926
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,239
I kept you around
for your smarts, not your skills,

927
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:36,599
and now you're not even smart.

928
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:39,510
You can't even control
an anesthesiologist...

929
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,610
and you're ruining my plans?

930
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,380
I apologize. I'm very sorry.

931
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,550
Go to the patient right now...

932
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,989
and inform him that the surgery
has been postponed to tomorrow.

933
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,360
And whatever happens,

934
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,030
make sure it's scheduled
for tomorrow.

935
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:00,730
Okay?

936
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,829
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

937
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:12,710

What's the matter?

941
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,030
Was your car towed?

942
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,559
I guess so. What now?

How could I have forgotten about it?

946
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,739
Do you want me to come with you?

947
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,110
Gosh. Would you?

948
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,949
I'd be more than grateful.

949
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,789
- You're buying dinner.
- Of course.

950
01:01:57,789 --> 01:01:58,889
It should include a meat dish.

951

Hold on.

But my mom cut me off
so I'm broke.

Hold on. Wait for me!

954
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:08,000
Beef would be nice.

955
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,329
Beef? That's Insane!

956
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,730
I have a better idea.
How about fried chicken?

957
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,900
I quit eating that.

958
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,969
Are you sick, my friend?

959
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,710
How can you quit fried chicken?

960
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,869
Let go of me.

961
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,110
But fried chicken...

962
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,309
No one quits fried chicken!

Right, Elizabeth?

That's not how one should be.

to quit fried chicken.

01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,000
I even have a nightmare about it.

986
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,369
What kind of nightmare?

987
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:06,309
One where everyone passes except me.

988
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:10,110
Wouldn't that be the worst?

989
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:13,079
I didn't know
you worried about those things.

990
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,880
Everyone worries, don't they?

991
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,489
The future is unstable
for all of us.

992
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,360
Once you become an attending,

993
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:25,429
will you head back
to the main hospital?

994
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:29,099
Why is everyone asking me that?

995
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,530
Who asked you that?

996
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,099
Ms. Joo.

997
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,699
Well,

998
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,139
I guess that's how...

999
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,940
everyone prepares for a goodbye.

1000
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,579
Those who come here
could leave at any time.

1001
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,349
Are you also...

1002
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:50,750
preparing for a goodbye then?

1003
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,090
Because I can always leave?

1004
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,190
Should I...

1005
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:56,789
prepare myself?

1006
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,960
You always dodge my questions!

1007
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,369
If I tell you to stay,
I'll seem obsessed.

1008
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,010
If I tell you to do as you please,

1009
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:14,139
I'll worry about
you actually leaving.

1010
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,579
That's why.

1011
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:22,719
Well,

1012
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:25,920
I'll give you an answer
once I pass the exam.

1013
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,920
Only then will I tell you
if I'm staying or not.

1014
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:34,159
You always play hard to get.

1015
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:35,960
You're right.

1016
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,199
For some reason,
it seems to only work on you.

1017
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:49,909
Mr. Park, have you seen Dr. Seo?

1018
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:51,909
No, I haven't.

1019
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,909
Didn't you two
leave together earlier?

1020
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,650
We did,

1021
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,550
but he disappeared.

1022
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,889
His phone is turned off too.

1023
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,920
What's going on?

1024
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:07,329
What do you think happened?

1025
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:10,659
I'm not sure.

1026
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:38,489
What is this?

1027
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,960
A contract.

1028
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:51,239
I'm still furious about
what you did to me,

1029
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,639
but I won't stomp
on a skilled colleague's future.

1030
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,079
That's why I sought out
other senior doctors...

1031
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,650
and lifted their boycott on you.

1032
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,179
I brought you a contract
with the best deal.

1033
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,320
Just for you.

1034
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,320
How tear-jerking.

1035
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:10,690
Friends don't get better than this.

1036
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,090
The contract even includes...

1037
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,900
a yearly salary
that's twice your current pay.

1038
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,229
With that money,

1039
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:20,270
you can pay off your debt
and thank Hyun Joon...

1040
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,369
for all his troubles.

1041
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:24,270
Don't you agree?

1042
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:37,649
Sign the darn papers
while we ask nicely.

1043
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:47,729
Woo Jin.

1044
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:51,470
I hear there's a doctor...

1045
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,270
named Master Kim.

1046
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,479
(Oddball Project)

1047
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,189
Could something have happened?

1048
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,560
He hasn't shown up
for almost an hour...

1049
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,199
and his phone has been turned off.

1050
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,100
Should I call the police?

1051
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:33,140
What?

1052
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,720
Woo Jin, are you kidding me?

1053
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,989
You can't just disappear like that.

1054
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,699
I was worried sick.

1055
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,270
I have something to tell you.

1056
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:04,510
Sure. Go ahead.

1057
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:09,510
I'm afraid...

1058
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,949
I'll move to another hospital.

1059
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:25,359
What?

1060
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,100
You see,

1061
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:36,899
my journey up until this point
wasn't easy.

1062
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:41,710
Life was...

1063
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,609
so cruel...

1064
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:53,619
that I wanted
to call it quits several times.

1065
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:02,800
Still...

1066
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:07,470
I'm glad I didn't give up.

1067
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,739
For the first time in my life,

1068
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:18,850
I complimented myself.

1069
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:23,850
Because I didn't give up,

1070
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,689
I was able to meet you.

1071
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,430
Our time together has been short,

1072
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,100
but I'm grateful for everything.

1073
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,579
(Dr. Romantic 2)

1074
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,520
Will you stop playing the victim?

1075
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,649
Did you sleep with him?

1076
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,350
We're friends.

1077
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,250
So please don't leave.

1078
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,359
Woo Jin, I want you to be in charge.

1079
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,659
Aren't you going to scrub in?

1080
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:41,300
May I ask why you keep pushing it?

1081
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,260
This might be your only chance
to survive, Dr. Park.

1082
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,899
I think you have a guest.

1083
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:48,739
Think of it as my last homework.

1084
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,470
I'm hoping you would've
at least learned something...

1085
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:54,270
during the time
you spent here with me.
