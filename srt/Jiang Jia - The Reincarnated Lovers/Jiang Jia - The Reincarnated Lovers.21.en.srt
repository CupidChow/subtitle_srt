Have some.

You haven't eaten anything long.

You won't be able to take it.

We'll

have another baby.

that he died of a sudden illness.

But I had a coroner check him.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,239
He died

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
from chronic toxicity.

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,319
This is a diary I found

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,680
at his home.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,120
Thursday.

25
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,560
Queen of Jiangling

26
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,680
is pregnant

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,359
for two months.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,239
Tang Wanwan had just lost her baby.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,159
She and Xuan Yi will
be in no mood to investigate.

30
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,680
As time passes,

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,319
the mystery will
become more difficult to solve.

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,359
However, Father has

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
always favored Xuanyi.

34
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,200
This half-month appointment

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
might not happen.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
There are

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,159
thousand ages to traverse

38
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,520
and eight directions to explore.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,639
Princess Jingyue.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
There is ample time ahead.

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,680
Mr. Zhuge,
thanks to your ingenious plan,

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Lv Qiao

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,639
concealed musk within the unity knot.

44
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,960
Tang Wanwan would never have thought

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,719
that the gift she gave to Xuanyi

46
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,439
caused the death of her baby.

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,280
(Baby.)

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,639
(I failed to protect you.)

49
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,879
(I'm sorry.)

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,479
(In your next life,)

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,000
(you must find a good family)

52
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,960
(and grow up peacefully and healthily.)

53
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,400
Mr. Chen.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,039
Your Highness.

55
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,000
Whose is this?

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
A few days ago,

57
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,080
I found this baby in the backyard.

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,800
Poor thing.

59
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
The swaddle was covered in blood.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,719
The baby's family
might be going through something.

61
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,520
Princess Dowager

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,800
asked me to take the baby
to the countryside for a few days

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,090
before making further arrangements.

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,580
Who would have thought
that Princess Dowager...

65
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,159
Your Highness.

66
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,319
Your Highness.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
Wanwan has been finding time

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
to serve Princess Dowager lately.

69
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,039
Lady Zhang.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
You don't have to watch her

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,319
like she's a criminal.

72
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,639
I believe in my own eyes.

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,039
I must watch closely to prevent any harm

74
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,639
to Princess Dowager again.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,570
How loyal and reliable, Lady Zhang.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,520
My mother passed away early
due to illness.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,150
Since I married
into the Prince's residence,

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
I see Mother as a motherly figure.

79
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,159
Now, with Mother bedridden,

80
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,719
I should take care of her.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,000
As for those claims against me,

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,360
I believe there will come a day

83
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,160
when the truth is revealed.

84
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,399
Your Highness.

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
According to the clues we have gathered,

86
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
we've checked all the pharmacies.

87
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
None of them sell coagulation pills.

88
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,759
This clearly suggests

89
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,120
that there are Xiliang spies

90
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,800
operating within Jiangling.

91
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,399
Only those with a devious mindset

92
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,360
could manage
to keep things so tightly under wraps.

93
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,360
Look into

94
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,920
the Xiliang residents who've been living

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
in Jiangling for the past few years.

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,120
Understood.

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,959
I, in my ignorance,
failed to recognize Master Hua

98
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,759
to be Seventh Young Master
of Xiliang Province,

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,879
Dugu Yan.

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Father ordered me to pose
as a wealthy merchant's son from Xiliang

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
and infiltrate Jiangling for years,

102
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,720
all with the purpose

103
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,600
of being able to meet allies

104
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
like Young Master Hanya

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,160
and you, Mr. Zhuge.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
Everything is going as planned.

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
Once the Minister's residence falls,

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,800
Xiao Xuanyi will be left
with few capable people by his side.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,360
We can easily take over Jiangling

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,279
when the time arrives.

111
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,839
When that happens,

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Young Master Hanya

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,879
will be Jiangling's new ruler.

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,879
Rest assured, Young Master Yan.

115
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
I will

116
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,759
join forces with Xiliang

117
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,560
and assist your father

118
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,319
in achieving his ambitions.

119
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,399
Good.

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,319
Speaking of Tian Capital,

121
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
I happen to recall an interesting story.

122
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,480
The current Empress

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
actually gave birth

124
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,000
to twins back then.

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,279
A boy and a girl.

126
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,040
The girl was born with heterochromia.

127
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,680
The Empress feared it was ominous

128
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,199
and would affect her son's future,

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
so she heartlessly

130
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,759
abandoned her daughter.

131
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,160
Born with heterochromia?

132
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,720
Could it be...

133
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,560
Yes.

134
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,120
Tang Wanwan is actually...

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
I also found out by chance.

136
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,759
The midwife

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,439
who delivered her back then

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,199
became my wet nurse.

139
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,600
Mother.

140
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,600
Mother.

141
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,759
Mother.

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Relax.

143
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,560
Take your time.

144
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm here.

145
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,240
What do you want to say?

146
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,000
How about this?

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,279
I'll ask you.

148
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,879
You just blink.

149
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,000
Is the person who hurt you

150
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,759
in the residence?

151
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,199
Tian.

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,680
Does their name contain "Tian"?

153
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
Xing.

154
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,199
Or perhaps,

155
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,519
Yue?

156
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,000
Could it be

157
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,079
Princess Jingyue?

158
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
I understand.

159
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,839
Were you also reincarnated
during the Lantern Festival?

160
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Yes.

161
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
At first,

162
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,480
I thought it was a dream.

163
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,399
But it was

164
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
just too strange.

165
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,879
Many things that happened in this life
didn't occur in the previous life.

166
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,519
Do you still

167
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,940
remember the previous life's destiny
of Princess Jingyue?

168
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,279
In the previous life,

169
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,639
she married

170
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,320
into Xiliang.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
So I was surprised

172
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,759
to see her again in Jiangling

173
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,399
in this life.

174
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,120
What have you found?

175
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,960
Take a look at this.

176
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,720
(Chunlai: Lin Jingyue threatened
Dongdou with our child.)

177
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,320
How do we solve this chess game?

178
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,080
Try it, and we'll know.
