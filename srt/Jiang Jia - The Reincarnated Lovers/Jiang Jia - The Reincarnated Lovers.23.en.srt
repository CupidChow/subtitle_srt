=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,280
Are you okay?

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,000
You must be jealous of Yin'er

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,879
for being Master's legitimate child,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,440
while you

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,760
are just a random child
from the streets.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,790
What nonsense are you talking about?

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,640
I heard what Master said
before First Madam's memorial tablet.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,200
You're not the Tang Family's daughter.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,840
You're just a mongrel

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,920
Master and First Madam
picked up on the streets.

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,679
You're a blue-eyed monster
with no parents.

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,520
Impossible.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,159
That's impossible.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,119
Master.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,679
Why did you let Princess Jingyue
eavesdrop outside that day?

18
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,399
Given Lin Jingyue's temperament,

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,480
she would definitely
go to find Tang Wanwan.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,920
Only the creature cornered
in a true dead end

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,799
will engage in a frenzied fight

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,439
as if possessed.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,680
But you also know

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,820
that Tang Wanwan
is Pavilion Master's bottom line.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,799
Also,

26
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,200
you promised him

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,760
not to harm her.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,599
It's just a tactic to delay.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,319
Tang Wanwan will undoubtedly die.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,680
No one can become Qing'an's weakness.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,719
(There have been many cases
of Xiliang's people disguising)

32
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,239
(as Jiangling locals
and infiltrating the city.)

33
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,799
(What are they up to?)

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,879
Your Highness, what's wrong?

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,920
Xiliang is starting to take action.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,599
Keep a close eye on them.

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
They originally joined Great Yuan
with ulterior motives.

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,060
We must not let them
find any opportunity

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,400
to instigate war and cause chaos,

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,879
making the people suffer.

41
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,799
(It's absolutely impossible.)

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,359
(How could I not be
my father's biological daughter?)

43
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,840
I wonder

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
how Jingyue is now.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,439
Why are you still thinking about her?

46
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,719
All men are equal

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,300
in the eyes of the law.

48
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,000
Now,

49
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,479
she has committed a heinous crime.

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,240
After being arrested,

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,599
she can't escape from Great Yuan's law.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
But after all,

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,319
I raised her with my own hands.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
All these years,

55
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,840
haven't you loved her
as your own daughter?

56
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,599
But is she worthy of our love?

57
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,919
She's my only daughter after all.

58
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,800
Your Majesty.

59
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,520
Your Highness.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
I just found out

61
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,810
that someone shot this thing

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,759
at the door plaque.

63
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,879
Oh no.

64
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,639
Wanwan is in trouble.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,159
Lin Jingyue.

66
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,800
What do you want to do?

67
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,159
I want

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,919
you to disappear.

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
This way,

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,639
Xuanyi will be mine alone.

71
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,120
It's not too late for you

72
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,560
to turn back now.

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Why should I turn back?

74
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,759
I haven't done anything wrong.

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,879
He and I

76
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,439
have grown up together

77
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,840
since childhood.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,840
But you destroyed my everything.

79
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,120
You appeared out of nowhere

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,479
and took away all his love.

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,120
Tang Wanwan.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,039
You deserve to die.

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,479
Stop!

84
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,639
Xuanyi.

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,959
Xuanyi.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
You came.

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,639
Look.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,759
Is my wedding dress beautiful?

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,279
I sewn it, stitch by stitch.

90
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,160
I waited for this day...

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,040
for so many years.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,519
The position of Queen of Jiangling

93
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,839
is mine.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,279
It can only be mine.

95
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,199
It's all because of her.

96
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,279
It's all her fault.

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,120
She bewitched you.

98
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,240
She's a monster.

99
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,600
Jingyue.

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't do anything foolish.

101
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,639
Come back with me, okay?

102
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,279
Right.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
You're a monster.

104
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,040
Otherwise,

105
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,720
how would Mother abandon you?

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
What do you mean?

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,560
You and Crown Prince

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,000
are siblings.

109
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,519
Her Highness gave birth to twins.

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,079
Stop talking.

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,959
But you're a heterochromia monster,

112
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,759
a natural witch.

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,519
So Mother threw you away.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,360
To Mother,

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,199
you're a filthy object she despises.

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,399
No.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
It's impossible.

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,319
You're lying to me.

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
You're lying to me.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,319
And I, Lin Jingyue,

121
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,439
was born noble

122
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
and deeply loved by Mother.

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,360
It's impossible.

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,759
You're lying.

125
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,519
Today,

126
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,460
I'll take justice into my own hands.

127
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,680
A person like you

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
shouldn't live in this world.

129
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,319
Xuanyi.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Xuanyi.

131
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Both of you go to hell together!

132
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,720
Jingyue.

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
Tang Wanwan.

134
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you know how your baby died?

135
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
It's because

136
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,360
there's musk in that.

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,160
You both killed him.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,199
So,

139
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,160
I didn't lose.

140
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,199
I, Princess Jingyue,

141
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,759
never give up.

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,439
Wanwan.

143
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,759
Jingyue!

144
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,780
(Baiye Pavilion)

145
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,399
Lin Jingyue, that waste.

146
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,000
Well.

147
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,000
It seems

148
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,560
Tang Wanwan's life

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
shouldn't end.

150
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,759
Master.

151
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,399
The arrangement
at the Minister's residence is done.

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,399
That woman

153
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
was efficient at her job.

154
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,039
Empress.

155
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,639
What is going on?

156
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
I was wrong.

157
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,799
Back then...

158
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,799
Is everything prepared?

159
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,919
The royal princess will be sent to a family
in Muye Province.

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,679
I have investigated.

161
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,559
That family is kind-hearted.

162
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,039
They won't mistreat the royal princess.

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,879
Regarding the matter of the twins,

164
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,240
it must not be revealed.

165
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,080
Apart from you and me,

166
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,720
only the midwife knows.

167
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
I've already sent her into retirement

168
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,850
and told her never to return
to Tian Capital.

169
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Do you want to hold
the royal princess longer?

170
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,759
No need.

171
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,039
Wait a moment.

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
This is my maternal family's heirloom.

173
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,320
I hope it will keep you safe and sound.

174
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,159
Go.

175
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,639
Yes.

176
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,480
I didn't only give birth
to Crown Prince.

177
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,480
But

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,879
I gave birth to a pair of twins.

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
Among them, the girl

180
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,039
was born with blue eyes.

181
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,879
Naturally heterochromatic

182
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,879
is considered ominous.

183
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,080
Back then,

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
you were a new emperor

185
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,960
with an unstable foundation.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,290
You faced challenges from everywhere.

187
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,440
Royal Princess and Crown Prince

188
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,440
were twins.

189
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,360
So I...

190
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,919
So,

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
you abandoned me.

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,240
♪Before the storm♪
