3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,600
Wanwan.

4
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,559
You discarded me

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,519
for your royal status
and wealth, didn't you?

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,399
If it weren't for Mother and Father

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
finding and adopting me,

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,840
I might have

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,640
ended up as prey for wild animals.

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,880
Everything was arranged

11
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,039
to send you to a good family
in Muye Province.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,359
I didn't expect

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,039
the carriage to be attacked

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,479
by bandits on the way.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
I assumed you had already...

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Over these years,

17
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,159
I haven't ceased
to miss you for a moment.

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,560
No wonder

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,159
during the sacrifice

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,159
of the entire Lin Family years ago,

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,719
I

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,760
was preparing

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,640
to grant their descendants a mansion,

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,599
yet you insisted

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
on keeping Jingyue by your side.

26
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,920
All the love

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,719
meant for Wanwan

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,719
has always been poured onto Jingyue.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,680
Empress.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,239
This...

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,200
This is bewildering.

32
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,159
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
You can hate or blame me.

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
I...

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
I dare not.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,840
I need to rest.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
Please leave, Your Majesty.

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,840
Sure.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,480
She needs rest.

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,400

Lv Qiao indeed is suspicious.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,319

I don't know

99

what you like, Wanwan.

100
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,839
So, I sent someone

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,639
to buy things

102
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,560
commonly favored

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
by young girls.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Also,

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
these were

106
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,399
all handmade by the Empress
for both of you.

107
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

108
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,519
Here, Wanwan.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,199
Try this.

111
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,759
She doesn't eat wild herbs.

112
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,399
How about trying the lamb?

113
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,439
Yes.

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,580
She doesn't eat lamb either.

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,240
No worries.

116
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,959
How about this?

117
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
We'll figure out

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,279
Wanwan's preferences in the future.

119
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,759
There's been

120
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,920
some activity
in Xiliang Province lately.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Regarding

122
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,600
the coagulation pills,

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
I followed a lead

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and found

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,040
several traces

126
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,240
related to bamboo slips.

127
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Bamboo slips?

128
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,600
Like the writing papers
in Tian Capital and Jiangling,

129
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,720
they are commonly used
in Xiliang Province.

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,690
They're uncommon in Jiangling.

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,079
They are communicating
with people in Xiliang,

132
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,890
reporting on the situation in Jiangling.

133
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,319
It seems

134
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,879
this Prince of Xiliang

135
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,639
has indeed developed infidelity.

136
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,120
Father.

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,319
Wanwan.

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
You're back.

139
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,920
That day,

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,040
I was talking to your mother
in the ancestral hall.

141
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,680
I didn't expect Second Madam
to overhear

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,360
and spread rumors in the house.

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,040
Wanwan.

144
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,480
You are our child.

145
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,879
I never forget

146
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
your love and care for me.

147
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,800
No matter what,

148
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,360
you'll always be my father.

149
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,439
Good girl.

150
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,120
By the way, Father.

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,079
I came here

152
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,240
to ask if you've

153
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,959
had any contact
with the Prince of Xiliang.

154
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
I'm the Minister of Jiangling.

155
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,040
How could I have any contact
with the Prince of Xiliang?

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
Has anything strange
or anyone suspicious

157
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,279
shown up recently in the house?

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,240
Did something happen?

159
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,639
No.

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,560
I just heard rumors.

161
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,390
The Prince of Xiliang
has been restless lately.

162
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,279
I'm worried

163
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,360
it might affect you.

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Being falsely accused would be bad.

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm clean as a whistle

166
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,800
and not afraid of baseless rumors.

167
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,399
(Perhaps I'm overthinking it.)

168
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,839
(Things are vastly different)

169
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
(from my previous life.)

170
00:07:59,399 --> 00:07:59,879
Yes.

171
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,279
I believe in you, Father.

172
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
What's the deal with that rockery?

173
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,319
Miss Wanwan.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,199
Madam Meng thought the courtyard
was too empty,

175
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,000
so she had a rockery built recently.

176
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,480
Mr. Zhuge.

177
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,159
I've followed your instructions
as promised.

178
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,519
Shouldn't you

179
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,440
fulfill your promise now?

180
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,759
Of course.

181
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,559
I've ordered Zhu Que
to burn those bamboo slips.

182
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Do you

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,240
no longer doubt my father?

184
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,240
No.

185
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,759
I've never doubted.

186
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,879
Lord Tang

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,200
has devoted his entire life
to Jiangling.

188
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,159
Besides,

189
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm not foolish.

190
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,120
You've had your moments, too.

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,159
Why you...

192
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
I've been looking into the bamboo slips
from our previous life,

193
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,519
but so far,

194
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,240
I haven't found any leads.

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
The mastermind

196
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,320
is extremely cunning.

197
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,120
(Baiye Pavilion)

198
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
Baiye Pavilion's tactic
is truly impressive.

199
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,440
You had Tang Feng's concubine
bury the bamboo slips in the backyard.

200
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,080
Unfortunately,

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,879
they were still discovered.

202
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,919
The scout just reported

203
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,360
that Xiao Xuanyi

204
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
burned those bamboo slips to ashes.

205
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,720
If Xiao Xuanyi were that easy to handle,

206
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,519
my father wouldn't have sent me
to infiltrate Jiangling for years.

207
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,039
He's not easy to deal with.

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,679
We can

209
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,919
target his weakness.

210
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,039
Tang Wanwan?

211
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,960
Love

212
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,679
is a shackle.

213
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,200
It traps ordinary folks in the mundane.

214
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,399
Even someone like Xiao Xuanyi

215
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,960
is no exception.

216
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,399
This shackle
doesn't just trap Xiao Xuanyi.

217
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,679
It might

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,480
also entrap you.

219
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm greedy.

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,159
Whether it's power

221
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,960
or woman,

222
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,559
I want them all.
