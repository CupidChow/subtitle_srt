=Episode 14=

3
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,440
Leaving so many guests behind.

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,039
What kind of manners is this?

5
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,519
Xuanyi.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
It's your birthday.

7
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,560
You can't leave like this.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,079
Your clothes...

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,600
The fabric you had someone send over

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,159
was especially suitable for Jingyue.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,880
So, I gave it to her.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,600
Xuanyi.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
I told you when we were young.

14
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,799
I like dark purple the most.

15
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,200
Why would I remember it?

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,650
You specially chose that, right?

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,480
Your childhood sweetheart
likes dark purple.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
But for me, you just randomly picked one.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Just a random choice.

20
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,959
Men

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,000
are deceptive.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,879
Who is it?

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,879
(What smell is this?)

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,799
Wanwan.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,519
Where did she go?

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,159
Didn't she say she wasn't feeling well?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Your Highness.

28
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,800
Your Highness.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,039
Young Master Hanya?

30
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,960
Why are you sleeping here?

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,360
I saw a suspicious figure earlier,

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,919
so I followed it.

33
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,479
I don't know why,

34
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,680
but

35
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,479
I fainted.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
A figure?

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,340
(Urgent matter)

39
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,319
Urgent matter.

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
Meet in the woodshed.

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,639
Wan.

42
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,479
This...

43
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,000
I didn't write this.

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,599
Looks like someone has set up a trap.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
We need to act cautiously.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Okay.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
The door is locked.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,479
How come?

49
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,120
Wan.

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,319
No, we can't.

51
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,680
Oh no!

52
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,439
The woodshed is on fire.

53
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,960
Tang Wanwan.

54
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,160
Xuanyi.

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,759
It's dangerous.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Quick.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,120
Hurry up.

58
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:45,959
Faster.

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,680
Hurry up.

60
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
I've been waiting for you long.

61
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,439
Xuanyi.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
I've run out of patience.

63
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,279
Xiao Xuanyi.

64
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,720
Didn't I say not to disturb me?

65
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,639
Your Highness.

66
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,240
In the woodshed,

67
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,680
Young Master Hanya and I...

68
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,879
I'm quite busy now.

69
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't have time
for your trivial matters.

70
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,519
On my way back to the room,
I saw a figure and followed it.

71
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,990
I followed it to the woodshed.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,020
After I pushed the door,

73
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I fainted.

74
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,199
Somebody

75
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,279
wrote a note in my name
to trick Young Master Hanya into coming.

76
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,279
And then,

77
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,990
both Young Master Hanya and I
were drugged with an aphrodisiac.

78
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,600
I ordered a thorough search.

79
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,930
There wasn't a trace of the drug.

80
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
How come?

81
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,360
(Paradise Restaurant)

82
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,920
Usual aphrodisiacs

83
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
would leave traces no matter what.

84
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,519
But with a paper made
of blue sandalwood,

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,560
combined with the weeds in the woodshed

86
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,959
that was sprinkled with cornus water,

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,839
one could produce a similar kind

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,959
of aphrodisiac effects.

89
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,959
Princess Jingyue.

90
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,040
You're truly

91
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,639
smart and meticulous.

92
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm afraid

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,879
I don't know

94
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,519
what you mean, Mr. Zhuge.

95
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,399
Rest assured.

96
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,600
I lent you a hand.

97
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,240
The note you gave to Young Master Hanya

98
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,000
would only vanish if the woodshed

99
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,799
caught fire,

100
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,000
wouldn't it?

101
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,639
You started the fire.

102
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,639
Oh no!

103
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,399
The woodshed is on fire.

104
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,240
Mr. Zhuge, I wonder

105
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
what's your purpose of telling me this?

106
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,720
It's getting late.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll take my leave.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,639
I also know

109
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,679
about the arrow poison leaf incident.

110
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you really
not considering cooperation?

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
If you have evidence,

112
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,639
go report me then.

113
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,799
I

114
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,639
am not easily threatened.

115
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,799
Interesting.

116
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,879
Your Highness.

117
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,990
Her Highness packed up and returned
to the Minister's residence.

118
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,840
Shall we prepare a carriage for you
to pick her up?

119
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
She's the one at fault.

120
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,799
Yet, she picks a fight with me

121
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,679
and expects me to go and get her.

122
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,039
Do I seem like such an undignified man?

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,990
You don't seem like one.

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
You've always been one.

125
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Get out.

126
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,159
Yes.

127
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,790
(About the woodshed incident,)

128
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,230
(you don't need to explain further.)

129
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,879
(I don't care at all.)

130
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,559
(I don't want to see you.)

131
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,360
Wait.

132
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Come back with me.

133
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,559
Didn't you wish not to see me?

134
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,320
I wouldn't dare to defy you.

135
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,879
Aren't you going
to explain the woodshed incident?

136
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,279
You said you didn't care.

137
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,480
Why ask now?

138
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,840
You're the one at fault,

139
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,279
and yet you act self-righteous.

140
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,240
What do you mean I'm at fault?

141
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,519
I've explained it all.

142
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,279
But you didn't trust us.

143
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Us?

144
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,759
Tang Wanwan.

145
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,960
