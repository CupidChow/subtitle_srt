00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,720
=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,640
Father.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,890
The one who hijacked the execution ground

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,519
may not be Xuanyi.

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,239
Besides him,

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,199
who else has the courage?

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,399
Moreover,

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,559
have you seen him until now?

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,399
This witch.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,719
Was it not enough to kill Qing'an?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,090
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,479
Xuanyi must have been bewitched
by that witch.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,920
Please spare him.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,990
Princess Dowager Yuan.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,799
Get up quickly.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,759
Help her up.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,759
Your Highness.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,600
Get up.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,990
Princess Dowager Yuan.

21
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,799
This matter shouldn't be made public.

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,840
Now,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,439
we must first find them.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,159
I remember last time,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,550
you helped me
apply the medicine like this too.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,799
It's a pity.

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Pity?

28
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,799
It's a pity

29
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,400
that that step is missing.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,239
Ouch!

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,660
Your hand is injured,
and you're still mischievous.

32
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,040
Serves you right.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Is this how
you treat your life-saving benefactor?

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
Why did you take risks to save me?

35
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,640
His Majesty will blame you.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,359
You're in danger.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,719
I can't just stand by.

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,319
Fool.

39
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,680
I want to go back.

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't want to live with shackles

41
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,799
in this world.

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,159
I don't want my child

43
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,000
to have a mother who is a murderer.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
If I leave now,

45
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,480
it will definitely
implicate my entire family.

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,959
Alright.

47
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
I'll go with you.

48
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,120
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
Your Majesty,
please give me half a month

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,820
to find the real culprit
who killed Tang Yin'er.

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Well, Tang Wanwan.

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
You committed murder

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,919
and escaped from the execution ground.

54
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,199
Each of these

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,879
is enough for you
to lose your head 100 times over.

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,199
Now,

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,120
you still dare
to negotiate terms with me?

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Since I've chosen to come back,

59
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,120
I have nothing to fear.

60
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,439
Your Majesty,
please judge wisely.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,560
Give me the chance to clear my name.

62
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,199
What if, after half a month,

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
you still find nothing?

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm willing to take the blame.

65
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,879
I'm willing to vouch for my wife

66
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,159
and share the same guilt.

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Highness.

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,599
Xuanyi.

69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,879
Well, Xiao Xuanyi.

71
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,360
I still haven't punished you

72
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
for hijacking the execution ground.

73
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Guards!

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,759
Have that Zhu Que

75
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,240
give him a severe punishment.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
Understood.

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Majesty.

78
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,280
You can't continue this.

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,599
How can that be?

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,360
I can't go back on my words.

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
I'll take

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,919
the rest.

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
No.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
It's okay.

85
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,919
It doesn't hurt.

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
You two are quite affectionate.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,280
Forget it.

88
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,159
After all,
you only have half a month left.

89
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,199
Am I really a witch?

90
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,759
Everyone associated with me

91
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,039
will have bad luck.

92
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,439
You are not.

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,840
Even if you are,

94
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,159
I'm not afraid either.

95
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,400
I won't die easily.

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Don't move.

97
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,319
If I tell you,

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,399
you won't believe it.

99
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,800
A sorcerer

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
once called me

101
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,720
a Nine-Tailed Immortal Fox.

102
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I have nine lives.

103
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,560
A tail serves as a life.

104
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm not afraid of you.

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,439
(This sentence...)

106
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
Lad.

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,199
You are the Nine-Tailed Immortal Fox

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,480
who has nine lives.

109
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,360
This...

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,439
If I'm not mistaken,

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,759
this should be

112
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,240
the birthday gift

113
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,240
you promised to give me, right?

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,519
Where did you get it?

115
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,120
I found it on the ground.

116
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,000
Found it on the ground?

117
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,319
You still have the nerve...

118
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,959
to say that?

119
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,160
My birthday gift

120
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,920
was thrown on the ground just like that.

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,720
Maybe

122
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,959
you stepped on it a few times.

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,439
Impossible.

124
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,560
I didn't.

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,839
Don't move.

126
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,240
There's a sound.

127
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,439
What sound is it?

128
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,519
So it was him saying

129
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,759
that his mother

130
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,000
is a heartless woman.

131
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,560
Are you not in pain anymore?

132
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,360
Not anymore.

133
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,160
Wan, slow down.

134
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,439
Qing'an.

135
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,240
Catch up with me.

136
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,800
Wan.

137
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,279
You're my only wife

138
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,519
in this lifetime.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
Both of you.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,959
Go out first.

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,199
My Xuanyi.

143
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,079
You've suffered.

144
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,890
Does it still hurt?

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,800
You...

146
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,959
You rascal Zhu Que.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
Who gave you the courage

148
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,120
to hit Xuanyi so hard?

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,350
I can't defy the imperial order.

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,519
You said to hit him hard.

151
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,560
You...

152
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,959
Has he

153
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,279
always been this senseless?

154
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,519
Yes.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,879
Thanks to me.

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,820
I found several coroners
to investigate the body.

157
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,399
Finally,

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
a coroner from the Xiliang

159
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,680
actually discovered

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
coagulation pills.

161
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,439
When did you know about it?

162
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,399
Just before

163
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,040
you hijacked the execution ground.

164
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,399
Otherwise, why would I agree to give you
half a month to investigate the case?

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,759
Well,

166
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,079
I'm not a foolish ruler.

167
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,090
Then why didn't you say it earlier?

168
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,279
Say it earlier?

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
If I did,

170
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,190
how would you
hijack the execution ground?

171
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
How would you

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
become a hero?

173
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,079
How would you

174
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,879
have the beauty in your arms?

175
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,959
You didn't see it that day.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
When he hit your behind,

177
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,959
your wife

178
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,079
was crying so hard.

179
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,879
Hurry up.

180
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,920
What are you standing there for?

181
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,079
Help Xuanyi to rest.

182
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,079
Hurry.

183
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,519
This was discovered by another coroner.

184
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,680
In Tang Yin'er's body,

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,230
there are residues
of coagulation pills.

186
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
Coagulation pills?

187
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:57,720
Yes.

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Coagulation pill

189
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,759
is a medicine from Xiliang.

190
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,879
It can confuse the time of death,

191
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,680
affecting the autopsy.

192
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,720
There's such a strange medicine.

193
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,600
This won't do.

194
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
I must inform His Majesty.

195
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,319
No need.

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,480
He already knows.

197
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Already?

198
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,279
What I mean is...

199
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,519
he knows it

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,600
just a bit earlier than us.

201
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,839
Actually,

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,759
it's not too much earlier.

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,120
No wonder His Majesty agreed
to give me half a month.

204
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,279
He's not a foolish ruler.

205
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,720
I suddenly realized

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,080
that sometimes

207
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,679
your expression

208
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,240
is quite similar to His Majesty's.

209
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,639
If that's the case,

210
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,759
you can secretly
call me Your Majesty too.

211
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh, you...

212
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,840
I wonder how Hanya is doing now.

213
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,840
Tell me.

214
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Why are the two of them

215
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,720
enchanted by Tang Wanwan?

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
Back then,

217
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,879
how did we end up
bringing her into the family?

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
It's truly a sin.

219
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,320
If Jingyue becomes my daughter-in-law,

220
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,360
that would be wonderful.

221
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,279
You're absolutely right.

222
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
Your Highness.

223
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,320
Whose child is this?

224
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,440
I found him at the back gate just now.
