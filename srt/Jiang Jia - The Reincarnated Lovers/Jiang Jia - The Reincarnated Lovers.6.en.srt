I don't agree with shaving Wanwan's head

65

66
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,680
Age is very important to young women.

The daughter of Tang

are a perfect match.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
We will grant this wish

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,079
and permit these two

116
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,839

You are now the future Queen of Jiangling.

You don't need to kneel all the time.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
What if I don't want
to be the Queen of Jiangling?

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,720

129
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,839
Is it because of that

130
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,519
or because you think little of me?

131
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
You jest.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,519
