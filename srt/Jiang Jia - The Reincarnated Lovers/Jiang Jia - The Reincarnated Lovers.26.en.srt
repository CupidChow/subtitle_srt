Qing'an!

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,120
My life

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,480
has been worthwhile.

that Hua Xingyan
is Young Master Yan of Xiliang.

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
People are not always what they seem.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,920
You've just recovered.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
Do you really have to go?

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah.

61
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,980
The Prince of Xiliang's
treacherous heart never dies.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,040
He's been itching to make a move.

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,120
This time,

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,120
I will defeat him completely,

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,540
ensuring he doesn't

66
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,000
dare to cause trouble again.

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400

70
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,360
Mother.

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,320
Xuanyi wrote that he won the battle.

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
He will be back

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
in a few days.

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Your Highness.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
If it hadn't been for this rebellion,

76
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,360
I wouldn't have imagined

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,960
that the Prince of Xiliang
has been planning this for years

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,640
and even secretly
made himself an imperial robe.

79
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
Unlike Jiangling, Yunmeng, and Muye,

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,600
Xiliang hasn't

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
been a territory
of Great Yuan for generations.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,300
It was only after the current Emperor
succeeded to the throne

83
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,800
that they submitted to Great Yuan.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
The Emperor has been

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,090
exceptionally kind to them.

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
It turned out

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
to be cherishing a snake.

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
The Prince of Xiliang

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,680
met his deserved end,

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
death.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,800
Your Highness.

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,880
You're returning
to Jiangling in such haste.

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Is it because

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,400
you miss the Queen of Jiangling?

95
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,080
After the Prince of Xiliang's suicide,

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
his several sons

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
have all been captured,

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,320
except Young Master Yan who is missing.

99
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,200
I am worried

100
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,160
that he might
go to Jiangling for revenge.

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,720
Understood.

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,120
Your Highness.

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Bad news.

104
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,750
The Xiliang Army broke into the city,

105
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,180
about to massacre the people
of Jiangling.

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
How is that possible?

107
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,990
His Highness
just wrote to me a few days ago,

108
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,960
stating that the Prince of Xiliang
committed suicide

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,990
and that His Highness would return
after settling the aftermath.

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
Young Master Yan
escaped from Xiliang overnight.

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Leading a formidable army,

112
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,640
he quietly infiltrated Jiangling.

113
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,320
Your Highness.

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Bad news.

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,490
Hua Xingyan and his army
have surrounded our residence.

116
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,000
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

117
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
Tang Wanwan.

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
Long time no see.

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Hua Xingyan.

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
What do you want?

121
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
I want

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
to play a game with you.

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
Don't be nervous.

124
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,000
It's an easy game
of choosing between two options.

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
If you die,

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,400
they'll live.

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
But if you choose to live,

128
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,280
they will

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
not be able to live then.

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,320
Xiao Xuanyi claims to love the people.

131
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
You and the people are all dear to him.

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,680
I'd like to know losing which one
will make him more heartbroken.

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,680
Shameless rat.

134
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,400
My patience is little.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Will you choose or not?

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Three.

137
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Two.

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,400
One.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll choose.

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
I'll trade my life for theirs.

141
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,040
The Heaven and Earth

142
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
will bear witness.

143
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
If you fail to fulfill your promise

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,480
and harm the people of Jiangling again,

145
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,640
