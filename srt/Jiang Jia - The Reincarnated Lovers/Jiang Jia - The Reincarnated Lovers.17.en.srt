2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,160
Your Highness.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,120
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm fine.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,890
Focus on taking care of yourself.

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,039
It's surprising

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,960
that you're a member
of the Baiye Pavilion, Mr. Zhuge.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,880
Life

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
is full

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,479
of unexpected twists.

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,439
Just as I didn't expect,

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,200
you've bribed Physician Sun

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,960
to assist you, Your Highness.

15
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,640
I didn't instruct him to harm the heir.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,280
I only wanted him

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,359
to delay the due date by one month.

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,959
Once suspicion is planted,

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
it can grow

20
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,719
into a towering tree

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,879
that crushes people.

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,400
Your Highness.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,159
This move is truly ingenious.

24
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,959
You flatter me, likewise.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,159
But I'm curious

26
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,840
about your desires,

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,879
Mr. Zhuge.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,079
Isn't it related

29
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,359
to Young Master Hanya?

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,599
While you and Young Master Hanya

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,280
are both members of the Baiye Pavilion,

32
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,959
you kept your scheme

33
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,690
against Tang Wanwan a secret from him.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,319
I believe Young Master Hanya

35
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,919
must have feelings toward Tang Wanwan,

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,560
and your attitude toward him

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
is attentive.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,599
I'm afraid that the only person capable

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,039
of making you exert such effort

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
is Xiao

41
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,800
Qing

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
An.

43
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,479
Your Highness,
you're exceptionally clever.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,080
We are destined to be allies

45
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,560
on this journey.

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,520
Who's there?

47
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,719
Father.

48
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,840
Mother.

49
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,159
Why did you just arrive?

50
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,840
Yin'er.

51
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,319
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon,

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,070
and His Majesty has suggested

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,479
we celebrate together.

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,719
I've decided not to compete

55
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,840
with Tang Wanwan.

56
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,159
Instead,

57
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,400
I'll request His Majesty
to arrange a marriage for you.

58
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,719
Please make sure

60
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,759
to dress up nicely

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
on the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

62
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,840
Why are you behaving oddly?

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,439
When I see Xuanyi

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,879
and Wanwan together like this,

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,759
it reminds me

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,759
of when I accompanied

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,479
my wife

68
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,159
during her pregnancy.

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
Everyone,

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,080
let's not hold back

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,479
and enjoy the night together.

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,520
Tonight, there is no distinction
between us,

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,879
only the bright moon above.

74
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
During the last Mid-Autumn Festival,

75
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,599
Qing'an

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,690
used to play the zither
in the courtyard.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,279
Your Highness.

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,620
Please accept my condolences.

79
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,680
Mother.

80
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,399
I'm knowledgeable

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,519
in music.

82
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,720
How about

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,839
I play a piece

84
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,240
for you?

85
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,160
Good idea.

86
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,570
Princess Dowager Yuan.

87
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,279
Your godson

88
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,519
is incredibly talented.

89
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,439
I grant permission on your behalf.

90
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,000
Come to serve the zither.

91
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,600
(Why does this melody)

92
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,399
(seem familiar?)

93
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,560
Young Master Hanya
is a delightful surprise.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,519
Not only is he skilled in martial arts,

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,460
but his playing of the zither
is also outstanding.

96
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,480
Don't you agree,

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,879
Wanwan?

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Indeed.

99
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,879
Your Majesty.

100
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,879
I wish

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,920
to seek a marriage
for my daughter, Yin'er.

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,120
Yin'er...

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

105
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,000
No harm done.

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,800
No harm done.

107
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,480
I think

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,160
Miss Yin'er

109
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,560
and Young Master Hanya

110
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,480
seem to be a perfect match.

111
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,160
Your Highness.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
I wonder if you could join me

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,120
in completing the next half of the song.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,439
I'd love to.

115
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,160
Wanwan, pay attention today

116
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,120
as I showcase my skills.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,639
Wanwan.

118
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,639
Young Master Qing'an

119
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,519
is still alive.

120
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,390
Wanwan, please come with me.

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,090
It's not convenient
to discuss this here.

122
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,480
What do the words

123
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,639
you just said mean?

124
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,039
