00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,720
=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,420
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

4
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,000
Miss Tang.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
It's too bad.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,590
Something happened to Her Highness.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,760
Initially,
Her Highness claimed to feel unwell

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
and wanted to rest in bed.

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,359
But in the latter part of the night,

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,599
she began to foam at the mouth.

11
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,200
Her Highness' pulse is chaotic.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,530
It's beyond my capability.

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,480
I cannot discern the illness.

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,640
Quickly summon all the physicians
in Jiangling.

15
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,000
Understood.

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
How could this happen?

17
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,239
All the physicians in Jiangling
have examined her,

18
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,159
yet they can't discern Mother's illness.

19
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,719
Miss Tang, please don't worry.

20
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,750
His Highness has already gone
to find a reclusive miracle physician.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,319
I believe

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Her Highness will be cured.

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,319
Hongdou.

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,690
Help me make a bowl of clear porridge.

25
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,879
I'll visit Mother later.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,030
Understood. Your Highness.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,890
Her Highness is awake.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,090
Summon Physician Sun immediately.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,560
Mother.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
Get out
of the Prince of Jiangling's residence.

31
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,199
Get out.

32
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,360
Mother.

33
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,840
What have I done wrong?

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,479
Get out.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,439
This is bad.

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,599
Many commoners in the city

37
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,719
suddenly showed symptoms

38
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,199
similar to Her Highness.

39
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,400
So everyone believes

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,800
that all of this is because

41
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,320
you're ominous, Your Highness.

42
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,319
What?

43
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,560
Lady Zhang.

44
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,439
I'm here.

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,680
Convey my decree.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Starting now,

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,400
she's no longer part of my family.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,879
Understood.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
Drag her out.

50
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,319
Mother.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
Get out.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,639
Mother.

53
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,240
Miss Tang.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
Hongdou.

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,840
Quickly release Miss Tang.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,260
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,800
Burn the witch Queen

58
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,759
to appease the wrath of God.

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,639
Eliminate the ominous thing.

60
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,520
Miss Tang.

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Her Highness said

62
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,680
that from now on,

63
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,319
this woman has nothing to do

64
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,800
with the Prince's family.

65
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,120
Heterochromia

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,960
is ominous.

67
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,159
If God is angered,

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,039
it will bring endless calamity
to Jiangling.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Burn the witch Queen.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,039
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

71
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,599
- Eliminate the ominous thing.
- Burn her!

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,790
- Bring back peace to Jiangling.
- Burn her!

73
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
Everyone, stay calm.

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,510
I understand that you're panicking
because your family members are ill,

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,439
but please give me some time.

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,199
I will definitely find out the truth.

77
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
Witch.

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,680
Begone!

79
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,159
Burn the witch Queen.

80
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,080
Eliminate the ominous thing.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,039
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

82
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,520
Burn the witch Queen.

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,479
Eliminate the ominous thing.

84
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,290
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

85
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,290
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

86
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,800
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm not.

88
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm not.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,280
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

90
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,599
This is retribution.

91
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,199
It's all retribution.

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Did you find out

93
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,920
who caused the illness
of Princess Dowager Yuan and the people?

94
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,279
No.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,959
Keep investigating.

96
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,120
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

97
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,319
Understood.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
Back then,

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,279
I wholeheartedly assisted Xiao Cheng.

100
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,480
But what did he do?

101
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,040
He took my Qingluan

102
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,480
as his own.

103
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,959
If it weren't for him,

104
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,959
how would Qingluan have died?

105
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,040
Qing'an.

106
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,720
You can rest assured.

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,879
I will definitely save you.

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,560
I will also

109
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,480
help you reclaim everything
that belongs to you.

110
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Only through blood repayment

111
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,279
can I avenge my deep-seated hatred.

112
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,399
(I'm not a witch.)

113
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,480
(In my whole life,)

114
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,639
(I have never done anything evil.)

115
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,240
(Why treat me this way?)

116
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,680
(Living a second life,)

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,990
(all I want is to protect my family.)

118
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,879
(Why is fate so unfair?)

119
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,360
I am Prince of Jiangling.

120
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,360
I will definitely find out the truth.

121
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,480
But I am also her husband.

122
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,839
I won't allow anyone to harm her.

123
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,480
Your Highness.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,839
Don't be misled by this witch.

125
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,120
It will bring disaster.

126
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,399
If there truly is
a witch causing trouble in Jiangling,

127
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,959
I will eliminate it.

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,519
But she...

129
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,959
is also my wife.

130
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,319
I'm willing
to bear the consequences with her.

131
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,199
Your Highness.

132
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,240
Are you asleep?

133
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,079
Come in.

134
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,839
Your Highness.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,319
The sorcerer and his apprentice

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,780
have been thrown into the dungeon.

137
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,360
Got it.

138
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,519
No.

139
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,879
I'm not a monster.

140
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,279
No.

141
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,480
You Highness.

142
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,639
Her Highness seems to be frightened.

143
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,480
In my hometown,

144
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
whenever someone is frightened,

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,319
they experience

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,759
nightmares at night.

147
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,160
Just sing a lullaby,

148
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
and the nightmares will be gone.

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Your Highness.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
Why not

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
sing one

152
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,199
and try it?

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,759
It's a superstition.

154
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,600
How could I
do something so embarrassing?

155
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,399
Leave.

156
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,560
Yes.

157
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,800
Your face

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,639
really resembles your mother's.

159
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,079
Qingluan.

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,399
Rest assured.

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I have found a way to cure Qing'an.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,680
I won't let anything happen to him.

163
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,160
Master.

164
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,199
Among the new maids
in the Prince's residence,

165
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,079
we have arranged our people.

166
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,399
I'm Lv Qiao.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,319
I'll surely complete the mission.

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,639
