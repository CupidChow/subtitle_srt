00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,900
=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,500
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,519
(Qing'an.)

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,039
Is this how

5
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,200
the Prince of Jiangling

6
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,320
treats his savior?

7
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,280
Baiye Pavilion's
newly appointed pavilion master.

8
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,240
Young Master Hanya.

9
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,159
Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,000
Sigh.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,879
Indeed,

12
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,799
nothing can escape

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Prince of Jiangling.

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,400
Master of Baiye Pavilion.

15
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,000
Why were you in the woods today?

16
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,560
Just passing by.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,799
A coincidence.

18
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,159
I was just on my way
to the Prince of Jiangling's residence.

19
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,000
To seek refuge with Your Highness.

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:31,799
Your Highness.

21
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,079
Young Master Hanya

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,490
has pledged allegiance to you
with Baiye Pavilion.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,239
Your Highness.

24
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,159
You truly win everyone's hearts.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,280
Zhu Que.

26
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,680
What do you think of this?

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,519
Is there any problem?

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,280
Baiye Pavilion is the top
assassin organization in the world.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,820
Whoever possesses this Baiye Token

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,480
can command all the assassins
of Baiye Pavilion.

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,120
Young Master Hanya

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,079
entrusting such a pivotal item to you

33
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,920
must signify

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
a sincere act of allegiance.

35
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,879
But there's something about him.

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,799
A familiar aura.

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,199
Thank you for saving me, Young Master.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,439
My pleasure, Your Highness.

39
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,080
Your Highness?

40
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,960
Your eyes are truly beautiful.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,080
Very much like

42
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,599
someone I used to know.

43
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,520
But what happened to your hair?

44
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,000
When I was young,
I contracted a strange illness.

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
My head of black hair

46
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,840
suddenly turned white.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,479
My body is no longer what it used to be.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,080
Indeed,

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,439
it's quite lamentable.

50
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,919
Your Highness.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,479
You don't need to comfort me.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,039
I actually think

53
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,400
that I am fortunate.

54
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,560
If I still had my former looks,

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I would have countless pursuers.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,719
In this world,

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
love

58
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,599
is the hardest thing to understand.

59
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,960
Young Master Hanya, you're humorous.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Looks like my wife
has become more cheerful lately.

61
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,319
Even with a stranger,

62
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,400
she can chat away freely.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Young Master Hanya is our savior.

64
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,000
How is he a stranger?

65
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,199
Young Master Hanya,
you're truly likable.

66
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,120
Even my mother

67
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,080
admires you at first sight.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
She wants you as her godson.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,039
I wonder,

70
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,800
how do you feel about that?

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
To refuse would be impolite.

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
Mother.

73
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,280
Please have some tea.

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,039
Uncanny.

75
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,000
The resemblance is uncanny.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,839
Say,

77
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,879
isn't it as if

78
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,920
the heavens have arranged

79
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,399
for me to lose one son

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
and gain another son.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,759
Mother.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
You are a good person.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,100
You will surely
have the protection of the heavens.

84
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,519
Good child.

85
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,959
From now on,

86
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,560
we are a family.

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,439
Xuanyi.

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,600
Take good care of your younger brother.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,680
Yes.

90
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,839
Mother.

91
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,879
Brother.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,519
Sister-in-law.

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
Try these, everyone.

94
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,639
These

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,879
are all made by Jingyue.

96
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,439
Her culinary skills

97
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,920
are extraordinary.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,480
Your Highness.

99
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,600
You're teasing me.

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm just telling the truth.

101
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,680
Jingyue

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,800
is indeed our lucky star.

103
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,199
Unlike someone

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,319
who encountered assassins
on her way home

105
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,040
and implicated others.

106
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,439
How unlucky.

107
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,000
As the Prince of Jiangling,

108
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,519
I have countless enemies.

109
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,920
Over these years,

110
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,199
those who want me dead

111
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,240
are too many to count.

112
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,290
I've long been accustomed to it.

113
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,199
Here.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Thank you.

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,639
I'm really sorry.

116
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,759
Are you okay?

117
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,199
It's okay, Wanwan.

118
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,240
It's my carelessness.

119
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
Hurting the Princess

120
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,639
deserves a good slap.

121
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,240
I dare you.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,319
Mother, what are you doing?

123
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,240
It's just a trivial matter.

124
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,439
Please stay calm, Mother.

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,199
Do you still remember

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
who killed Qing'an?

127
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Who caused him to be buried
without proper rites?

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Mother,
blaming all these sins on my wife

129
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,439
seems unfair, isn't it?

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,560
Fine.

131
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,839
I'm old now.

132
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
I can't control you anymore.

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
Your Highness.

134
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,199
Calm down.

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Young Master Qing'an, in his afterlife,

136
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,920
would find it hard to rest in peace

137
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,260
if you worry so much about him.

138
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,390
(It is said
that tying a white ribbon on a willow)

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,079
(can bring blessings to the departed.)

140
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,759
(Qing'an.)

141
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,990
(May you be free from illness
and disaster in the next life.)

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,800
Your Highness.

143
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,399
Young Master Hanya.

144
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
Your Highness.

145
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
May I

146
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,199
have a word with you?

147
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:36,959
Sure.

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,000
Your Highness.

149
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,800
I apologize for my abruptness earlier.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
No, I was too focused.

151
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,279
May I know

152
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,160
who Your Highness

153
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,600
was commemorating?

154
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
He was someone from my past.

155
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,560
He might not be a relative,

156
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,759
but he was more than that.

157
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,279
We grew up since childhood,

158
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,360
and he treated me very well.

159
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,639
But I

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
brought him harm.

161
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,759
(Both in the past life and the present.)

162
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,560
That's not your fault.

163
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,879
I meant,

164
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,399
if what you said is true,

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,159
that you two had a deep bond,

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,759
then he surely wouldn't blame you.

167
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,399
If not for me,

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,100
he would've traveled freely
through the Four Provinces,

169
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,279
enjoying his life.

170
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,159
Your Highness.

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
It's getting cold.

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
Take care of yourself.

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
Thank you, Young Master Hanya.

174
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,399
No problem.

175
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,519
Wanwan.

176
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,480
Young Master Hanya.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,120
What a coincidence.

178
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,600
I brought Xuanyi out

179
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,879
to accompany me

180
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,320
in search of some appetizing food
for Her Highness.

181
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,639
Wanwan.

182
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,759
Please don't misunderstand.

183
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,799
Princess Jingyue.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,919
I did not.

185
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,480
If that's the case, good.

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
After all,

187
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,799
it's not easy to explain

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
when a man and a woman hang out alone.

189
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,799
How were they alone?

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,399
There's me, His Highness, and Princess.

191
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
All three of us are here.

192
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,399
A man and a woman

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
hanging out alone.

194
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,600
