00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,759
Oh.

111
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,879
What's wrong?

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,959
Do you two know each other?

113
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,360
- We don't.
- We don't.

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,319
Qing'an.

115
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,439
You're injured.

116
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,199
It's nothing.

117
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,839
Just a minor injury.

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Xuanyi is injured, too.

119
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,759
His injury

120
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,720
is not my concern.

121
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,240
I only care about my fiance.

122
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,839
When did this happen?

123
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,399
Just now.

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
I've just decided.

125
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,879
Wan.

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,079
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

127
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,199
I am telling you now, aren't I?

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Marriage

129
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,399
is a serious matter.

130
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,199
It's none of your concern.

131
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,040
Since I was young, my eye color
made everyone see me as a monster.

132
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,920
Only Qing'an never despised me

133
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,560
and always protected me.

134
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,480
Because of him,

135
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,079
I learned

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
what true affection

137
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,319
looks like.

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Your Highness,

139
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,639
may I ask why

140
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,839
you need my daughter's birth details?

141
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,199
I've watched Wanwan grow up.

142
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,079
She is most compatible with my son,
the Prince of Jiangling.

143
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,920
If the two were to marry,

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,399
they would truly be a great match.

145
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,360
Your Highness.

146
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,799
Do you mean it?

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,519
Yes.

148
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,320
In that case, I'll thank you

149
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,240
on behalf of my daughter.

150
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,840
(Could I have altered subsequent events)

151
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,320
(by not saving Xiao Xuanyi
in this life?)

152
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,360
How did you recognize me

153
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,519
at first glance by the river tonight?

154
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,320
Xiao Xuanyi?

155
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,159
That's...

156
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,679
That's because Qing'an
showed me your portrait,

157
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,840
and

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
he often spoke of you in front of me.

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
Really?

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,399
Absolutely.

161
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,519
What about you?

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,879
Why sneak

163
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,559
into the Minister's residence
at this hour?

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
To ask you that question.

165
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,080
- What are you...
- Father.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Father.

167
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,559
Father.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,879
Wanwan.

169
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm gone for a day,

170
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,320
and you become more childish?

171
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,879
Alright.

172
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,519
Someone else is here.

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

174
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Lord Tang.

175
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,039
I'll take my leave now.

176
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,559
It's indeed a good marriage.

177
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,200
Father.

178
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,240
What do you mean by that?

179
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,279
Father.

180
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,799
Are you joking or something?

181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
Are you

182
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,559
overly excited?

183
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,279
Her Highness
proposed this marriage to me herself.

184
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,039
How could this be?

185
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,720
The late Prince of Jiangling
was an heir of a different lineage.

186
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,840
To counterbalance his authority,

187
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
his son, Xiao Xuanyi,

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,920
served as the Crown Prince's companion
in Tian Capital since childhood.

189
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,000
After his death,

190
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,399
His Majesty appointed Xiao Xuanyi
to assume the title

191
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,000
and tasked him with caring
for the former Queen of Jiangling,

192
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,919
now known as Princess Dowager Yuan.

193
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,440
Pitiful, isn't it?

194
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,559
Alas.

195
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,840
Those pitied

196
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,720
often deserve resentment.

197
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
What did you just say?

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
Oh.

199
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,360
I said...

200
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,320
Father.

201
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,960
Stay as far away as you can
from Xiao Xuanyi.

202
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,360
Or...

203
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,360
Father.

204
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,919
Resign from your official duties.

205
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
Wanwan.

206
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
You speak too lightly.

207
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,680
We have Tian Capital and four provinces

208
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,580
(Madam Meng, Tang Wanwan's Stepmother)
in the Great Yuan Dynasty.

209
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,320
After the conquest, His Majesty

210
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,639
ennobled four princes.

211
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,759
Other than Tian Capital,

212
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,200
each of the four provinces
is guarded by these princes.

213
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,639
Tian Capital sent ministers
as aides to them,

214
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,840
and they can't easily resign.

215
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,519
Yes.

216
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,600
(Tang Yin'er)
Mother is right.

217
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,799
Do you want to defy the imperial decree

218
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,360
and harm our family, Sister?

219
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Yin'er.

220
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,320
Second Madam.

221
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,159
You're exaggerating.

222
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,600
I wouldn't dare.

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,480
(You both can't bear
to lose this wealth and status.)

224
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,280
(In my previous life, you weren't around
during the Tang Family crisis.)

225
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,399
(You were swift to vanish.)

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,919
That's enough.

227
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,559
Wanwan probably thinks I'm too tired

228
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,919
and just feels sorry for me.

229
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,759
By the way,

230
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,360
Hongdou. Where are the clothes?

231
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,120
Father.

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,799
Are these...

233
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
These are the clothes I had someone
send from Yunmeng Province.

234
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,519
In a few days,

235
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,759
it will

236
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,799
be your coming-of-age ceremony.

237
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,679
Father.

238
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,519
Thank you, Father.

239
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
(Coming-of-age ceremony.)

240
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,519
(In my previous life, I...)

241
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,679
You shameless thing.

242
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,360
How dare you do such a thing?

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,440
You're a disgrace to the Tang Family.

244
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,399
(This time,)

245
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,639
(I won't let you succeed.)

246
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,440
(However,)

247
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,200
(new troubles are added to this life.)

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,679
(Mother actually arranged a marriage
for me and Tang Wanwan.)

249
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,360
(But Tang Wanwan)

250
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,240
(seems different from my previous life.)

251
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:12,960
Your Highness.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,799
Please have some tea.

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,159
Wan.

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
You've grown up.

255
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
We'll be family soon.

256
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,799
Your Highness.

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,799
I have two requests.

258
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,240
I hope for your favor.

259
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,080
My child.

260
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,440
Stand up.

261
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
I'll fulfill

262
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,039
whatever you desire.

263
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,799
The first request

264
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,080
is to revoke the decree

265
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,399
and cancel my engagement
to His Highness.

266
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,000
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

267
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,480
Wanwan.

268
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
How can you fool around?

269
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,279
Father.

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,559
I'm not.

271
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Every word I speak

272
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,360
is sincere.

273
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,039
Sincere?

274
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,960
I want to know

275
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,799
why you are unwilling to marry me.

276
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,879
Your Highness, I am not worthy of you.

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,879
You're the daughter
of an honorable minister.

278
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
Who in the entire Jiangling Province

279
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,120
would be suitable

280
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,480
if you are not fit for me?

281
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,559
Your Highness.

282
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,200
We have no feelings for each other.

283
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,679
Even if we marry,

284
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,360
it's unlikely

285
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,200
to end well.

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
I hope you can accommodate my request.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,039
What will you do

288
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,759
if I don't?

289
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,240
Your Highness.

290
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,519
If you don't agree...
