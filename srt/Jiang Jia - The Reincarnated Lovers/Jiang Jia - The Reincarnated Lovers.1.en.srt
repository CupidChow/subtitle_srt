=Episode 1=

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,639
How did Prince of Jiangling end up

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,019
(Daughter of Jiangling's Minister, Tang Wanwan)
marrying this blue-eyed monster?

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,520
Regardless,

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,938
Regardless,

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,759
(Paradise Restaurant)
she's the minister's daughter.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,179
(Paradise Restaurant)

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,879
Why is he...

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,738
(Escorting the Bride)

11
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:27,800
Are you asking for death?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,220
(Xiao Xuanyi,
Current Prince of Jiangling)

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,860
(Happy Wedding)

14
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,559
Bow to heaven and earth.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,279
Mother.

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,599
What's going on?

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,160
(Princess Dowager Yuan)
Xuanyi has urgent matters today

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,120
(Xiao Xuanyi's Mother)
and cannot be here for the ceremony.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,440
The entire Jiangling

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,040
knows that you are an ominous person.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,600
Using this chicken for the ceremony
can ward off evil.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,279
Furthermore,

23
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,519
you're not a virgin either.

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,258
Such a shameless thing.

25
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,999
How dare she do such a thing?

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,240
She's simply a disgrace
to the Tang Family.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,120
The matter that day
was a false accusation.

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm innocent.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,320
How dare you act recklessly

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,120
in the Prince of Jiangling's residence?

31
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,899
Tang Wanwan.

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,019
Starting today,

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,999
you're the wife of Prince of Jiangling.

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,359
You must abide by the rules here.

35
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,279
If it's my fault, I admit it.

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,559
If it's not my fault,

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,739
I absolutely won't admit it.

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,019
This is outrageous.

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,138
Take her down

40
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,600
and punish her.

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,960
Miss Tang!

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,320
We've got a problem.

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,100
Minister Tang
has been charged with treason,

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,079
and everyone in the residence
is to be executed on the spot.

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,880
(The Minister's Residence)

46
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,719
Father.

47
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,079
Wanwan?

48
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,679
Why have you returned?

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,359
Leave now.

50
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,079
No.

51
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,040
Father.

52
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,200
Don't worry about me.

53
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:23,378
Father.

54
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,359
Father.

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,320
Wanwan.

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,419
(Tang Feng, Jiangling's Minister)
I'm back, Father.

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,440
You must remember.

58
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,959
Never seek revenge.

59
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,839
Stay in the Prince's residence forever

60
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:40,720
and live your life well.

61
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,679
Xiao Xuanyi.

62
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:47,280
Xiao Xuanyi will definitely...

63
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,639
He will...

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,040
Father.

65
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,399
Father.

66
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,600
No.

67
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,299
Don't leave me.

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,079
Father.

69
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,519
Why are you here?

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,639
You used a chicken
as a substitute for the ceremony

71
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,600
just to annihilate my family?

72
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,000
You said you wanted to marry me.

73
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,519
Was it just to get close
to the Tang Family and frame us?

74
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,880
Ridiculous.

75
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,440
Why would I frame the Tang Family?

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
(Zhuge Ye)
Tang Feng colluded with Xiliang

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,618
(Jiangling's Strategist)
and plotted a rebellion. It's a fact.

78
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,160
The evidence is conclusive.

79
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:36,179
According to the law,

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,760
his entire family should be executed.

81
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,959
His Highness handled it fairly.

82
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,079
As the minister, my father

83
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,959
assisted two generations
of Prince of Jiangling wholeheartedly.

84
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,720
How could he possibly...

85
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,760
It's you.

86
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,618
You killed my father.

87
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,239
I'll kill you.

88
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,218
If I hadn't married you today,

89
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,359
as the daughter of a criminal,

90
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,760
you would have become a prostitute.

91
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,799
Xiao Xuanyi.

92
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,079
If I had known
you were this kind of person,

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,498
even if I became a prostitute,

94
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,600
I wouldn't have married you.

95
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,399
The time has come.

96
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,959
Let me go.

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,519
(The Minister's Residence)
Let me go.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,959
After we sleep together,

99
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,039
you'll become my wife.

100
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,279
You beast.

101
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,959
Listen to me carefully.

102
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,599
You are now mine.

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,978
From now on,

104
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,360
you have no more ties
with the Tang Family.

105
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,800
Dream on.

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,240
