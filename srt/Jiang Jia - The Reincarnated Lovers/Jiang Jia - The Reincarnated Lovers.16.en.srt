=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,879
This will cost you your head.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,960
Spare me, Your Highness.

5
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,079
I'm just doing my duty.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,239
Regardless of status,

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,619
she should be executed according to law.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,200
Let's go home.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,679
Xuanyi.

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,439
Why did you bring back this witch?

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,200
She's on death row.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,799
Her Highness is right.

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,200
This is incompatible,

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,119
and I'm afraid

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,560
we won't be able to silence the rumors.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
My decision is final.

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,960
I'll take responsibility

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,719
for any consequences.

19
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,000
You're awake?

20
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,079
Your Highness.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,239
Official Li took his life

22
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,560
in the dungeon.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Does your ominous aura lead those around

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
to lose their lives?

25
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,560
Take heed, Your Highness.

26
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:45,560
As the interrogator,
Official Li used unauthorized torture

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,439
to force my confession.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Now, fearing the blame
from His Highness,

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,640
he committed suicide out of guilt.

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,879
This Voodoo incident

31
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,280
indirectly suggests

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,599
that someone is framing me.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,959
Quite the sharp tongue.

34
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,200
Fine.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Share me

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
the excuse you have

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,519
to prove your innocence.

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,639
The handwriting on the Voodoo doll

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,159
resembles mine,

40
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,479
but there are differences

41
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,479
upon closer inspection.

42
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm right-handed,

43
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,680
while the person who wrote this

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,199
is left-handed.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,680
Mother.

46
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,080
I possess some proficiency
in calligraphy and painting.

47
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,960
Please let me take a look.

48
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,879
Go ahead.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
If the person is left-handed,

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,479
he should write strokes,

51
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,840
radicals,

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
and components

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,639
from right to left.

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,919
Moreover, the start bit of his writing

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
features a reflex hook.

56
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,479
It's clear

57
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,599
that the person is left-handed.

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,280
Indeed.

59
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,800
The person must be
within the Prince's residence

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,719
and intimately familiar
with Wanwan.

61
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,560
Mr. Zhuge.

62
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,840
Why are you here?

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,479
Yesterday,

64
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,560
I went with His Highness
to the city outskirts for some matters.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,680
But he suddenly left,

66
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,840
which caused me concern.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,439
Later,
I heard about the Voodoo incident.

68
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,879
(This belongs to Bao.)

69
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,199
(Bao is in their hands.)

70
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,840
Who would have the audacity

71
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,520
to commit such a heinous act

72
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,879
by falsely accusing the Queen?

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,360
This will bring bad luck
to their descendants.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
It's a pity

75
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,919
since the child

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
is innocent.

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,560
I did it.

78
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,879
I used my left hand

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,699
to imitate the Queen
of Jiangling's handwriting.

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Hongdou.

81
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,439
How could it be you?

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,840
Miss Tang.

83
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,159
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,439
I lied to you.

85
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,360
Her Highness
has been harsh with you,

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
and I wanted to advocate for you.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
So, I...

88
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,080
I was wary of prying eyes

89
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,280
in the servants' quarters

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,480
and feared discovery.

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,680
So,

92
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,480
I placed it

93
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,439
in your room.

94
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,360
Miss Tang.

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
I'll repay your kindness

96
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,240
in the next life.

97
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,040
Hongdou.

98
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I did it.

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,279
Hongdou.

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,600
Hongdou.

101
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,040
Hongdou.

102
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,560
How did it happen?

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
Hongdou.

104
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,040
My dear.

105
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,519
The girl

106
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,879
we found years ago, Wanwan,

107
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,279
has grown into a beautiful

108
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,800
and filial young lady.

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
If only you were still with us,

110
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,800
it would be wonderful.

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
(Baiye Pavilion)

112
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,480
Hongdou

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,079
and Scholar Chunlai

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
have an illegitimate son

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
named Bao.

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,079
Using the child's life,

117
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,079
you coerced her
into framing Queen of Jiangling

118
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,199
with witchcraft.

119
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
So,

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
you're the one who took the child away?

121
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
Otherwise,

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,279
why would Hongdou sacrifice herself

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,879
by taking all the blame,

124
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,160
resulting in her demise?

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
The child

126
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,000
is forever a mother's vulnerability.

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,759
It's you.

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,399
Well,

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,079
I've never been one to threaten others.

130
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,560
Your Highness.

131
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,000
A single person struggles to stand

132
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
while many others move with ease.

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,399
(As for the Voodoo incident,)

134
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,560
(Master claims no involvement.)

135
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,399
(But Hongdou...)

136
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,839
Watch where...

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,959
(Yin'er.)

138
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,639
(He looks)

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,399
(like Qing'an.)

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,079
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,839
Why does

142
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
he carry the fragrance of morning glory?

143
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,000
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

144
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,199
Your Highness.

145
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
I've already ordered

146
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,800
Hongdou's burial.

147
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,839
I knew that.

148
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,279
Their relationship

149
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,600
is truly wonderful.

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,399
It's a union

151
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,759
to be admired.

152
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Your Majesty.

153
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,519
Why are you here?

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,279
To check on your married life.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
I mean

156
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,240
to observe

157
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,759
and examine

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
the customs

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,120
of Jiangling Province.

160
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Your Majesty.

161
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,240
Mother.

162
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,559
This child

163
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,960
is quite pleasant.

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Princess Dowager.

165
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,279
Rest assured.

166
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,240
The descendants

167
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,399
have brought their blessings.

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,759
Wanwan.

169
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,440
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,159
What?

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,679
Is what you said true?

172
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,080
Wonderful.

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,960
Wonderful.

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
I did mention

175
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,619
that the descendants
bring their blessings.

176
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,240
Look,

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
the blessing has arrived.

178
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,960
Xuanyi

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,120
is having his child.

180
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,039
Congrats on the new grandson,

181
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,279
Your Highness.

182
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,639
Physician Sun.

183
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,879
Take good care

184
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,799
of Queen of Jiangling.

185
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,879
If there are any mishaps,

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll hold you accountable.

187
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,600
I've prepared the pregnancy medicine

188
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,519
and discussed precautions
with His Highness.

189
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,320
Queen of Jiangling

190
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,919
is in her first month

191
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
of pregnancy,

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,799
so

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,919
she must be careful.

194
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,039
Indeed.

195
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,840
It's better to be safe than sorry.

196
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,639
I'm delighted to hear that Xuanyi
is having his first child.
