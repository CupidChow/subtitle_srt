00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,199
There's news from Xiliang.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,039
It seems

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,250
that they have been planning
for many years.

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,960
Master, what you mean is...

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,399
Prince of Xiliang

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,719
has ambitious plans.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,200
He aims to seize the world.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,759
He has arranged spies

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,119
lurking in Jiangling.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,799
Xuanyi.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,120
I ordered the dishes
we loved as children.

14
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,039
Try them

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,290
to see
if they're same as before.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,880
And this jujube cake.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,990
I remember you loved it the most
when you were a kid.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,650
This was how it was when we were kids.

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,280
You take a bite, and I take a bite.

20
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,079
Yes.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
You still remember.

22
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,959
Why is this liquor so sour?

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm full.

24
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,000
You guys enjoy.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,159
Xuanyi.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
Is Wanwan angry?

27
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,599
I didn't mean to.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,319
Wanwan.

29
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't touch me.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,040
Do you know
how I've been living here these days?

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,760
I dare not offend you or Her Highness.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,590
His Majesty ordered the marriage,
and I had to marry.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,840
You bully me.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120
I have to endure it.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,759
Sorry.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,159
I was wrong.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
Don't touch me.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,199
I was wrong.

39
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,039
I won't do it again next time.

Wait.

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,879
This is mine.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
Not a fever.

58
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,020
Isn't this the jade pendant

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,490
that Her Highness
gave Young Master Qing'an?

60
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,839
Her Highness values ​​this jade pendant

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,079
like a treasure.

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
Your Highness, did you

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,439
steal it?

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,839
It's mine in the first place.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
Are you sure it's yours?

66
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,959
I said it is, so it is.

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,480
Yes.

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,439
Zhu Que.

69
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,199
Do you know

70
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,399
how to please a girl?

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,480
If you want to know how to kill a girl,

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
I can do it.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,959
As for how to please a girl...

74
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,199
I don't know either.

75
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,759
Miss Tang.

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,639
New clothes tailored for you
by His Highness.

77
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,880
Give him credit for having a conscience.

78
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
Miss Tang.

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,720
You must be more attentive.

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,240
Just now, I saw

81
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Princess Jingyue

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,399
busy organizing

83
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,680
His Highness' birthday banquet.

84
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,759
She's treating it

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,279
as if she were his wife.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,160
Hongdou.

87
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,240
Don't talk nonsense.

88
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,439
If others hear it, it won't be good.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
But Miss Tang,

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,399
His Highness still cares about you.

91
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,600
I

92
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
heard His Highness said

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,480
that when his birthday comes,

94
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,000
he must see the gift you've prepared.

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
It turns out

96
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,199
that the one
who used the arrow poison leaf

97
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,519
to poison the well and frame Tang Wanwan

98
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,639
was

99
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,120
that princess from Tian Capital.

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,519
Yes.

101
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,880
She knows a lot about medicine.

102
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,319
Let Lv Qiao

103
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,720
continue to keep an eye on her.

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,560
When necessary,

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
she can lend a helping hand.

106
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,680
I like people who are ruthless.

107
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,240
(The diligence of people
leads to abundance.)

108
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,199
(The people, as a solid foundation
ensures the prosperity of the country.)

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
(When the people are happy,
the nation is happy.)

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,439
(When the people are worried,
the nation is worried.)

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Your Highness.

112
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,420
Mr. Zhuge requests to see you

113
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,800
to discuss military matters with you.

114
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
Understood.

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I will go later.

116
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,399
Understood.

117
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,290
Why did Her Highness and Princess Jingyue
wear the same dress?

118
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,240
Wearing the same dress is only scary
to whoever is uglier wearing it.

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,480
Do you guys feel that Princess Jingyue
and His Highness are more compatible?

120
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,919
Wanwan.

121
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,080
I didn't expect this to happen.

123
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,080
It's just a coincidence.

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,159
Don't need to take it to heart,
Princess Jingyue.

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
Xuanyi brought

126
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,159
this piece of cloth from Yunmeng.

127
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't expect him to remember

128
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,639
that I like dark purple.

129
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,440
And this.

130
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,559
This is a Ruyi jade I brought
from the palace.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,159
The only one in the world.

132
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
Xuanyi is a person

133
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,380
who has been picky since childhood.

134
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,440
He doesn't bother to look
at ordinary things.

135
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,240
Wanwan.

136
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,890
What are you planning to give him?

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Although you say you don't want it,

138
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,519
in the end,

139
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,720
you put it on.

140
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,039
Of course.

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,559
It's from you, after all.

142
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,200
This dark purple

143
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,279
really

144
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,799
looks extremely good.

145
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,080
Of course.

146
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
I specially selected it.

147
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,960
By the way,

148
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,799
where's my birthday gift?

149
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,679
I didn't prepare it.

150
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,000
Mother.

151
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,070
I'm not feeling well.

152
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,190
