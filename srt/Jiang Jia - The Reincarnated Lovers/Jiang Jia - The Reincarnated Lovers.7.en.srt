=Episode 7=

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,900
Tang Wanwan.

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,460
Remember this well.

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,700
With the Emperor's decree,

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,020
you are Queen of Jiangling.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,460
Imperial orders are inviolable.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,420
Objection is disrespectful.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,800
You'll drag your family down as well.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,820
I can't protect you from it.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,780
You.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,340
Master Tang is old.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,580
He will not survive the torment.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,780
If you do not care about your father,

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,860
protest as much as you want.

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,500
Father.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,620
Wanwan.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,740
What is it?

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,940
Tell me.

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
Is it because of the marital decree?

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,620
Don't worry.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,790
I'll talk to His Majesty about it
tomorrow.

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,980
Even if I have to disobey,

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,820
I will not force you

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,220
to do something you don't want.

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,820
I only want my daughter to be happy.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
(Xiao Xuanyi was not wrong.)

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
(Imperial orders are inviolable.)

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,220
(I can't let him put himself in danger.)

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,420
(Moreover,)

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,700
(many things have changed now.)

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,820
(I'll have to improvise as I go.)

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,380
Father.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,180
The decree has been made.

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,860
If we keep rejecting it,

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,540
His Majesty will be angry.

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,500
Still, before this,

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,540
you would rather die
than marry His Highness.

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,100
I don't want to force you

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,140
to go against your heart.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,980
If you don't want to marry him,

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,420
I will risk my life

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,860
to protect you.

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,940
Father.

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,900
You must stay alive.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,940
Father.

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,540
Before this,

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,820
I misunderstood His Highness.

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,220
He's actually

50
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,460
not that bad

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,300
to me.

52
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,060
So,

53
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,100
don't worry.

54
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,460
I know my limits.

55
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,660
Really?

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,740
Yes.

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,860
Don't lie to me.

58
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,060
I would never.

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,020
Say, why would His Majesty

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,060
suddenly think

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,780
to marry you to Xiao Xuanyi?

62
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,060
Xuanyi.

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,420
Are you in love?

64
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:46,980
No.

65
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,540
Then why did you rush all the way

66
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,020
to Tian Capital

67
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,700
to ask for a marital decree?

68
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,860
I hear Miss Tang's strange eyes

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,900
have started many rumors
since she was young.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,740
Now that Young Master Qing'an is dead,

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
Miss Tang...

72
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,260
Xuanyi must be doing it for his brother.

73
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,420
That's why he wants

74
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,540
to protect Miss Tang.

75
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,380
Impossible.

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,740
It's impossible.

77
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,620
All these years,

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,460
Xuanyi

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,100
has never asked me for anything.

80
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
Anyway,

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,900
there are many ways to protect someone.

82
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,620
Why must he

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,940
have her for wife?

84
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,900
It's her second marriage.

85
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,820
Your Majesty.

86
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,460
You've lost.

87
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,420
No way.

88
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,700
She distracted me.

89
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,620
This doesn't count.

90
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,300
Let's go again.

91
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,780
It's your fault.

92
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,780
Ignore this.

93
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,500
Let's go again.

94
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,380
Mother.

95
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,100
Why not

96
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,380
we forget about it?

97
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,260
His Majesty is staying in Jiangling

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,790
so that he can officiate the wedding
in two weeks.

99
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,340
If someone finds out,

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,140
we'll be executed.

101
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,540
We can't just let that woman be Queen.

102
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,500
When that happens,

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,420
the both of us will be at her mercies.

104
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,340
I'll never let her have her way.

105
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,100
Mother.

106
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,380
Father.

107
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Second Madam.

108
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:32,940
Yes.

109
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,260
As expected of His Highness.

110
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Your bridal dress
is much more extravagant than before.

111
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,980
What are you saying?

112
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,300
Oh, pardon me.

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,060
I'm just too happy.

114
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,500
I'm happy for Wanwan.

115
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,990
Thank you, Second Madam.

116
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,060
Wanwan.

117
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,940
What is it?

118
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,820
Father.

119
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,060
For some reason,

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,900
my entire body

121
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,980
feels very itchy.

122
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,100
What?

123
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,380
What's going on?

124
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,660
Has she been infected with a disease?

125
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,820
Wanwan can't leave like this.

126
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,220
It might cause rumors to spread.

127
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,100
Yes.

128
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,260
How about this?

129
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,900
Let Yin'er attend in her place.

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,220
Wanwan will rest in her rooms until...

131
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,860
That's nonsense.

132
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
That will mean lying to the Emperor.

133
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,180
Master.

134
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,980
It's for Wanwan's sake,

135
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,460
for our family's sake.

136
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,940
I...

137
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:36,100
What's going on?

138
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,700
You should know full well, right?

139
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,060
Hongdou.

140
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,300
Tell everyone

141
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,260
what you saw.

142
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,300
Hongdou.

143
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,820
Just what is going on? Tell us.

144
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,540
Yes.

145
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,700
Master.

146
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,340
Yesterday, I saw

147
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,460
Second Madam...

148
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,420
That's what happened.

149
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,220
What are you saying, you stupid slave?

150
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,260
Father.

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,340
When I found out about it,

152
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,340
I sent the dress to the pharmacy.

153
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,220
I was told the powder used

154
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,980
is Ragged Black Jade Powder

155
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,680
which may cause scars.

156
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,700
Hence,

157
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,580
I returned the powder, untouched,
to Second Madam.

158
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,060
Tang Wanwan, you were acting just now.

159
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,460
What about it?

160
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,020
I'm only going by the logic

161
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,660
of an eye for an eye.

162
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,260
You.

163
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
You crazy woman.

164
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:51,980
Mother.

165
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,940
Tang Wanwan.

166
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
How dare you hit me.

167
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,820
Master.

168
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,220
Master, I'm innocent.

169
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Master, you must right this injustice.

170
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,260
Father.

171
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,350
Why don't we leave this
to the Investigation Bureau?

172
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,020
I believe

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,780
they'll get to the bottom of this.

174
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,660
However,

175
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,660
we can't air our dirty laundry.

176
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,820
Yes.

177
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,620
Tang Wanwan.

178
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,780
You can't go to the Investigation Bureau
for a family matter.

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
Plotting against the Queen of Jiangling

180
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,340
is not a family matter.

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,940
My wife is right.

182
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,780
Your Highness.

183
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,340
At ease, Master Tang.

184
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,860
I just heard

185
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
everything that happened.

186
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,900
We have evidence and a witness.

187
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,490
I hope you, Master Tang,

188
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,060
will take this seriously.

189
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,620
Meng has attempted

190
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,220
to harm the Queen.

191
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,220
Men.

192
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,660
20 slaps.

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,060
Master.

194
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
I'm innocent, Master.

195
