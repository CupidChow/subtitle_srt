00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,060
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,559
Yin'er.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,960
Tang Yin'er.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,039
Ah!

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,520
Someone's dead.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,799
Someone's dead!

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,359
Yin'er.

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,600
Yin'er.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,320
Someone's dead!

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,719
Queen of Jiangling killed someone.

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,799
Miss Yin'er is dead.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,119
My daughter.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,039
My dear.

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,679
My dear.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,280
Father.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,090
Do we need to seal off
the Prince's residence

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,519
and arrest the criminal?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,079
What criminal?

20
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,959
Even if Queen of Jiangling is pregnant,

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,680
the law does not show mercy.

22
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,439
I'm just considering
Your Highness' reputation.

23
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,959
What Jingyue said

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,359
makes sense.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,799
How about this?

26
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,280
First, detain
Queen of Jiangling temporarily.

27
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,599
We'll investigate

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,319
and see.

29
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,439
Your Majesty.

30
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
Xuanyi will definitely investigate this.

31
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,239
Father is also in Jiangling Province.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm afraid...

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,879
Rest assured, Your Highness.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Everything

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,200
is in accordance.

36
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,560
No one will know

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,560
what happened that day.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,319
Miss Yin'er.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
Why are you here?

40
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,280
Mr. Zhuge.

41
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,639
I didn't expect

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,879
you're the Master of Baiye Pavilion.

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,319
And also

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,919
Qing'an...

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,960
You guys...

46
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,240
You heard quite a lot, huh?

47
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,560
I gave Tang Yin'er a coagulation pill,

48
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,719
concealing the real time of death.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,120
The coroner will not find out.

50
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,639
Thanks to you,

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,039
Lv Qiao

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
played the role of Tang Yin'er.

53
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,719
Next up,

54
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,199
a good show

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
is about to begin.

56
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,599
I was at the door

57
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,000
and heard Queen of Jiangling
arguing with Miss Yin'er.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
After a while,

59
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,280
it sounded like a vase was smashed.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,719
Then,

61
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,879
Miss Yin'er

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,479
fell silent.

63
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,800
She actually killed her own sister.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,639
Mother.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,759
The autopsy results aren't out.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,800
We must not wrong the innocent.

67
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,120
Innocent?

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,639
At that time, in the wing room,

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
there were only she and Miss Yin'er.

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,919
Your Majesty.

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,100
The coroner has deduced the time.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
It was after the Princess
entered the room.

73
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,479
Death by a head injury
from a heavy object,

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,590
leading to fatal bleeding.

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I just remembered.

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
Queen of Jiangling

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
and Miss Yin'er

78
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,400
seemed to have a conflict
because of Young Master Qing'an.

79
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,879
I vaguely heard

80
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,680
Queen of Jiangling saying something

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
about missing Young Master Qing'an.

82
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,759
Wanwan is foolish.

83
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,080
No matter how much

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,759
she misses Young Master Qing'an,

85
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,600
she shouldn't...

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,319
Enough.

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Wan.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,800
Young Master Hanya.

89
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,199
I didn't kill Tang Yin'er.

90
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,000
At that time, she told me

91
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,079
that Qing'an wasn't dead.

92
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,920
She said she wanted to find
a secluded place to tell me in detail.

93
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,519
Then, we went to the study,

94
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
and she knocked me unconscious.

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
When I woke up,

96
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,920
she...

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,839
Wan.

98
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,319
She...

99
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,800
Wan.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Wan.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,759
I'll bring you away.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
We'll leave Jiangling Province.

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,439
I'll take care of you and the child.

104
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,720
Taking care of my child?

105
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll kill you.

106
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:20,839
Xuanyi.

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,680
Wan.

108
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,959
You're pregnant.

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,079
Be careful.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,279
Wan?

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,639
You even call her Wan.

112
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,160
Tang Wanwan.

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,520
You're actually protecting him.

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,199
Let me ask you.

115
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,879
If I didn't come,

116
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,360
were you planning

117
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,560
to run away with him

118
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,759
along with

119
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,560
your lovechild?

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,160
What?

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,959
You don't think the child is...

122
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,399
Physician Sun said the child
is only a month old.

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
A month ago, at my birthday banquet,

124
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,399
did you two...

125
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,040
We're not as lowly as you think.

126
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,980
(Xiao Beiyang)

127
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,140
Having a glutton daughter
would be delightful.

128
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,360
If you ever give birth
to a boy and a girl,

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,639
name them Xiao Nansang

130
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,560
and Xiao Beiyang.

131
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Any significance to that?

132
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,599
The South has Sang.
[*Mulberry trees]

133
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,719
The North has Yang.
[*Poplar trees]

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Cheerful is the gentleman.
Lights of the nation.

135
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,439
I like it.

136
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,519
Have a bite.

137
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,439
You have it.

138
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,680
No, you have it.

139
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,920
Your Highness.

140
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,759
I've returned the Baiye Token

141
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,040
to Young Master Hanya.

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
It's just that expelling him

143
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,720
from the Prince's residence

144
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,319
may anger Her Highness.

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
I'll handle that

146
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
by myself.

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,120
Yes.

148
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I've told you.

149
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,879
Xiao Xuanyi is a ruthless person.

150
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Otherwise,

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
he wouldn't have

152
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,920
watched you fall off the cliff

153
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,439
and did nothing.

154
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,120
Today, he's harmed you again,

155
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,639
expelling you

156
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,759
and treating you like a bereaved dog.

157
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,680
Qing'an.

158
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,940
(Pass)
Do you still see him as a brother?

159
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,319
Do you still see him as a brother?

160
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,360
In this world,

161
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,160
everything changes,

162
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
but not power.

163
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
Bear with it for now.

164
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,519
Once you wield the ultimate power,

165
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,120
Tang Wanwan

166
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,079
will return as yours.

167
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,160
Your Highness.

168
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,199
His Majesty

169
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,580
ordered me to deliver this to you.

170
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,399
Xuanyi.

171
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,079
What are you doing?

172
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,519
I've never asked for anything until now.

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
This time,

174
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
I beg you to save my wife.

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,279
You see.

176
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,799
You see.

177
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,840
All evidence is present.

178
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,879
You saw what happened outside earlier.

179
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,390
The people have voiced out.

180
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,000
It's hard to object.

181
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,960
As long as my wife is fine,

182
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,879
I'll do anything.

183
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,600
Why have I

184
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,080
never heard you say this?

185
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,480
I've noticed

186
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,240
Queen of Jiangling is admired by many.

187
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,080
There was Xiao Qing'an back then.

188
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,720
Now, there's Hanya.

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
If you don't work harder,

190
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,240
I'll be worried for you.

191
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
What I mean is,

192
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,159
this matter

193
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,360
is serious.

194
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,240
I must

195
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,519
think things through.

196
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Father.

197
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,399
Xuanyi.

198
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,840
Commoners have arrived outside,

199
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,120
as well as

200
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,519
Tang Yin'er's mother.

201
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,790
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

202
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,600
My poor daughter.

203
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,159
You died tragically.

204
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,240
My dear Yin'er.

205
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,639
Oh, Yin'er.

206
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,519
Your Majesty.

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,159
I humbly beg Your Majesty
to uphold justice for my daughter

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,240
and execute Tang Wanwan
with lingering death.

209
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,399
Your Majesty.

210
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,639
The evidence
and testimonies are sufficient.

211
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,360
Will Your Majesty
continue to turn a blind eye?

212
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,440
Alright.

213
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,240
Guards.

214
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,559
Convey my decree.

215
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,159
Three days from now,

216
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,080
Tang Wanwan will be executed.

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Your Majesty.

218
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,320
Enough.

219
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,720
(Prisoner)
You jinx.

220
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,440
You brought death
upon your mother and ex-husband.

221
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Now, you even murdered your sister.

222
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,639
(Prisoner)
Heterochromia is indeed ominous.

223
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,990
It will incur divine retribution.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,960
Die, you blue-eyed monster.

225
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,799
Father.

226
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,200
Wanwan.

227
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,919
(Is this my demise for this life?)

228
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,679
I don't want you to die.

229
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,060
(Prisoner)

230
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,679
Wanwan.

231
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
(Prisoner)

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Stop.

233
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,919
Go.

234
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,720
Chase her.

235
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
(Prisoner)

236
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,399
Who are you?

237
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,879
Why did you save me?

238
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
(Prisoner)

239
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,679
