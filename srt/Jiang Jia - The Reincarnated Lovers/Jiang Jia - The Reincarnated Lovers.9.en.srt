=Episode 9=

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,640
♪Swaying on the boat♪

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,879
♪Rocking to and fro♪

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,039
Your Highness.

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,039
What are you doing?

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,480
I was just bored,

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,760
so

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,039
I entertained myself by humming.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,640
What?

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,920
Your Highness.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,640
I left something out just now,

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,000
so

15
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,759
I came back.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
You were already humming a song

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,520
for Her Highness

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,840
to chase away her nightmares.

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,159
I stood outside,

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,799
not daring to disturb you two.

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,799
Chase nightmares away?

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,479
Yes.

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,039
I suggested it to His Highness.

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,640
His Highness

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,430
even said that it was a superstition.

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,519
But he started singing

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,920
and got invested in it.

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,640
Get out.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,690
Yes, Your Highness.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't listen

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,879
to his nonsense.

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,159
It must've been hard for you
to believe in a superstition.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Were you even

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,680
going to get a sorcerer

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,200
to read my fortune?

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,799
(Should I give her this hairpin?)

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,200
(Am I being too proactive by doing so?)

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,439
Hey, lad.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,959
You are extraordinary.

40
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,359
You are the Nine-Tailed Immortal Fox

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,719
who has nine lives.

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,519
The woman you met recently

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
must be

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
your true love.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,319
My destined one?

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
You have nine lifetimes,

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,719
and in every lifetime,

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
both of your fates
are closely intertwined.

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,520
Your Highness.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,890
What are you thinking?

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
Nothing.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,719
Anyway,

53
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,520
how's Mother?

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,360
And also,

55
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,120
the sick people in the city?

56
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,039
The miracle physician

57
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,680
has prescribed medicine for Mother.

58
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,240
I've also delivered the drugs
to the people's home.

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,919
But the physician

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,570
said that the medicine
only addresses the symptoms.

61
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,919
To solve the root cause,

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,199
we must find the source.

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,199
Unconscious

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,800
and foaming at the mouth

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,199
with no cause?

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,599
Your Highness.

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,319
I might

68
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,639
have a solution.

69
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:06,476
Your Highness.

70
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,599
Investigation on the poisoning case
in Jiangling has not made any progress.

71
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,680
The perpetrator is a cunning person.

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,560
For now, it is important for us
to treat the people.

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,120
Gather all the physicians in Jiangling
to come up with a solution

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,380
and deploy personnel for investigation.

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,800
We must find out the perpetrator.

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,520
Slow down.

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,560
Tang Wanwan.

79
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,400
Slow down.

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
Can't you hurry up?

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,599
Wait, Wan.

82
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,759
Why did you summon me
so early in the morning?

83
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,840
You have to work on your stamina.

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,319
Anyway,

85
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,240
I heard that the arrow poison leaf
is a unique plant in Xiliang.

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,390
As powder,
it is tasteless and colorless,

87
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,280
and it burns in fire but boils in water.

88
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,599
If one drinks it,

89
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,039
they will fall into a coma

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,890
and foam at the mouth.

91
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,199
It's incredibly difficult

92
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,919
to seek the cause of sickness.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,680
You're right.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,490
But what does that have to do with me?

95
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,960
Aren't you from Xiliang?

96
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,090
I'm sure you're very familiar
with the arrow poison leaves.

97
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,199
That's why I sought your help

98
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,780
to help me find the Perescia plant
that counters arrow poison leaves.

99
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,199
I think the sickness Her Highness
and the people suffer from

100
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,700
is related to arrow poison leaves.

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,199
Let's go.

102
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,870
(Wan Pavilion)

103
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,230
Why didn't you tell me Her Highness

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,490
is at Tianjing Mountain for herbs?

105
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,480
I thought you knew.

106
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,199
Moreover, she had set off

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,959
way before dawn.

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,279
If something happens to her,

109
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,319
I'll be questioning you.

110
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't worry.

111
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,600
Her Highness

112
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,800
is accompanied by Mr. Hua.

113
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,480
She's safe.

114
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,720
What did you say?

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,370
Are you actually

116
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,120
trying to trick a good-looking man
like me

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,290
into the deep mountain forest?

118
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,120
So that you can

119
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,399
do something indecent to me?

120
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,560
Let me tell you.

121
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,690
Don't even think about it.

122
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,560
My admirers

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
has lined up from Jiangling to Xiliang,

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,000
while I

125
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,240
try my best
to satisfy every one of them.

126
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,639
In your dreams.

127
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,040
You missed.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,399
I'm so...

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
unlucky.

130
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,040
Come on. You're on top of me.

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,759
Get up.

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,519
Your Highness.

133
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,839
Is this your solution to the problem?

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,600
Anyway.

135
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
How did you...

136
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,290
How did you know
about the arrow poison leaf?

137
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,560
After developing a suspicion,

138
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
I met the sorcerer in the dungeon.

139
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,120
With so many people in Jiangling
falling ill,

140
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,959
don't you think

141
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
it's related to the arrow poison leaves?

142
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't understand.

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Will you

145
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,879
stop pretending?

146
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,800
Your disciple has confessed.

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,800
I advise you

148
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,759
to spill the beans

149
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,959
and avoid punishment.

150
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,399
Ungrateful brat.

151
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,399
Your Highness.

152
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,420
It's none of my business.

153
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,639
I was forced too, you know.

154
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,120
That day,

155
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,240
a man wearing a straw hat

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,959
knocked me out.

157
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
He forcibly fed me arrow poison leaves

158
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,319
and made me follow his orders,

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
or else he would take my life.

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Are you sure it was a man
with a straw hat?

161
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,800
Yes.

162
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,519
The sorcerer

163
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,120
and a man with the straw hat.

164
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,319
Yes.

165
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,959
He threatened the sorcerer,

166
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,800
ground the arrow poison leaves
into powder,

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
and poured it into the well

168
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,240
that everyone in Jiangling uses.

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,290
Who's that man in a straw?

170
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,519
He's so cruel.

171
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,759
Luckily, when I was young,

172
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,490
Qing'an told me about the Perescia plant
and the arrow poison leaves.

173
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,090
Your Highness.

174
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,279
Your memory is great.

175
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,360
How do you remember
what Qing'an told you?

176
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,160
Zhu Que.

177
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,759
Less talking,

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,680
more working.

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,319
Look.

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,360
Perescia plants.

181
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,439
Don't.

182
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,490
Perescia plants have deadly thorns,

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
silly.

184
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,639
Stand back.

185
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,639
You're in no position

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,839
to look after my queen.

187
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,839
I'm free anyway.

188
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,300
It's nice to visit you, Your Highness.

189
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,199
You're the sweetest.

190
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Where's Zhu Que?

191
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,279
I ordered him

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,199
to send Perescia plants

193
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,079
to the homes with sick families.

194
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,439
Anyway,

195
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,290
we have this too.

196
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,519
Let's give Mother this.

197
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm sure

198
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,160
she'll heal soon.

199
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,319
Mother.

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,759
Mother.

201
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,240
How did you...

202
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,960
Jingyue's Perescia plant

203
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,000
saved my life.

204
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,720
I just happened to see them.

205
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,639
On my way back to Tian Capital
with Father,

206
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,290
I heard about the illness in Jiangling,

207
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,919
so I sought Father's permission

208
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,840
to come back

209
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
and see if I could be of help.

210
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,360
Jingyue's medical skills

211
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,039
are truly remarkable.

212
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
Anyone who has her as a daughter-in-law

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,039
must've been blessed
from their previous life.

214
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm just an amateur.

215
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,399
I just happen

216
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,639
to have read some books.

217
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,360
Mother.

218
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
My queen has also
brought Perescia plants

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,950
for you and the people.

220
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,279
Mother.

221
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,159
No, thank you.

222
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,480
I can't take it.
