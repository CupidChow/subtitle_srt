There's poison.

If it's not sucked out,

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,740
you'll die.

Didn't you say

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,740
we should

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,899
avoid physical contact?

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,899
Yes.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,939
I did say that.

16
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,899
Why did you save me, then?

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,019
I don't like owing people favors.

18
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,140
You got hurt because of me.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,699
Besides,

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,420
you're sort of like my younger brother.

21
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,420
What kind of brother am I to you?

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,700
You're Qing'an's younger brother.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,140
I'm his fiancee.

24
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,459
I should regard you

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,299
as a brother.

26
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:10,579
Tang Wanwan.

27
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,579
You...

28
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,099
Wan.

29
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,140
Qing'an.

30
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:22,939
Wan.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,700
Are you okay?

32
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,260
I'm fine.

33
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,980
Xuanyi.

34
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,539
You are poisoned.

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,819
No worries.

36
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,140
My sister-in-law

37
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,659
helped me neutralize the poison.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,819
With my hand.

39
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,539
What I meant was

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,179
that I used my hand

41
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,659
to neutralize the poison for him,

42
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,340
or else he would have died.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,980
Wan.

44
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,900
I failed to protect you.

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,099
If not for Xuanyi,

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,980
it'd be unimaginable.

47
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,099
Qing'an.

48
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,379
Don't blame yourself.

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,739
Some things are unpredictable.

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,500
As for...

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,060
As for Xiao Xuanyi,

52
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,419
you must watch out for him.

53
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:14,340
You mustn't let your guard down.

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,419
Wan.

55
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,620
Can you elaborate on that?

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,699
I meant

57
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,539
not everyone can be trusted.

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaking of which, Wan,

59
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,139
I recall you have a pair
of lovebird jade pendants.

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,620
Legend has it

61
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,060
that these pendants

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,539
signify a lifelong bond

63
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,378
between the two who possess them,

64
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,939
and they are destined

65
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,659
never to be separated.

66
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,098
Wan.

67
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,099
I wonder if I could

68
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,979
become the partner of your life.

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,099
What is this?

70
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,379
Give it back.

71
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,220
Thanks.

72
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,020
I didn't say it was for you.

73
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,539
Besides,

74
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,259
do you know the significance
of this pendant?

75
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,778
I like it,

76
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,379
so it's mine now.

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,580
Give it back.

78
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,419
(Tang Wanwan.)

79
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,699
(The past)

80
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,979
(is but smoke.)

81
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,859
(You must)

82
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,180
(keep moving forward.)

83
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,460
The other half of the pendant

84
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,818
will be yours

85
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:26,780
on our wedding night.

86
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,379
Wan.

87
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,740
Having you

88
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,780
in my life

89
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,620
is enough.

90
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,979
(I'm marrying Qing'an in a few days,)

91
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,419
(but why am I not happy?)

101
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,539
All changed?

102
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,939
This outfit

103
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,499
fits me so well.

104
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,340
Was it prepared for me?

105
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,619
It was prepared

106
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,020
for Qing'an.

107
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,020
Now that you've changed, leave.

108
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,820
I just saved your life,

109
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,659
and now you're chasing me away?

110
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,700
Wanwan.

111
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,418
It's late.

112
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,140
Who are you talking to?

113
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,139
Father.

114
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,539
I'm studying.

115
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:14,738
I'm reading...

116
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:15,700
"Lessons for Women".

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,780
"Lessons for Women"?

118
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,099
Oh.

119
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:21,939
Good.

120
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,658
Don't stay up too late.

121
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,978
Your eyes need rest.

122
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:25,979
Got it.

123
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,178
Hurry up and leave.

124
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,299
Don't get caught,

125
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,059
or they'll suspect a break-in.

126
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,178
With that mouth of yours,

127
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,059
no wonder you've been harmed

128
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,419
several times.

129
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,619
Why you.

130
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,020
It's none of your concern,
Your Highness.

131
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,499
Physician.

132
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:00,819
My daughter

133
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,819
was perfectly fine.

134
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,340
How did she suddenly become like this?

135
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,179
Your daughter has a weak body.

136
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,220
Her vitality is depleted.

137
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,020
I'm sorry, Master Tang.

138
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:10,178
Master.

139
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,020
Father.

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,859
Father.

141
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,259
Are you saying

142
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,700
Tang Wanwan's life is at its end?

143
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,619
The spy planted
in the Minister's residence

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,460
said so.

145
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,538
Miss Tang

146
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,659
is suddenly bedridden.

147
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,619
What is she playing at this time?

148
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,579
Have you noticed the eerie atmosphere

149
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
in the house lately?

150
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,179
Miss Yin'er.

151
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,340
I heard

152
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,459
that a person's soul

153
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,900
leaves the body before they die.

154
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,418
If there's resentment,

155
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,700
it seeks revenge
on those who wronged them.

156
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,580
Tang Yin'er.

157
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,260
You've made me suffer so much.

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,619
I want you to pay with your blood.

159
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,059
It wasn't me.

160
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,338
It really wasn't me.

161
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,379
It has nothing to do with me.

162
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,139
I just wanted to scare you.

163
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,499
I never thought they'd bury you alive.

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,218
I had no idea they'd be so ruthless.

165
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,539
It was my mother
who pushed you into the pond later.

166
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,900
You ungrateful child.

167
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,780
Father?

168
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:31,738
Master.

169
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,859
What are you doing?

170
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,619
Yin'er...

171
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
Yin'er is your precious daughter.

172
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,580
Wanwan is also my daughter.

173
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,979
I couldn't believe it at first,

174
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,059
so I had her feign illness
to test all of you,

175
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:45,820
and this is the outcome?

176
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,020
You all are grounded.

177
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,460
Reflect on this properly.

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,700
Master.

179
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,619
Your Highness,
I have something to discuss with you.

180
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,059
Sure.

181
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,059
Your Highness?

182
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,819
Weren't you talking
to my father in the hall?

183
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,380
We're done.

184
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,059
It's late. Please leave.

185
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:31,419
Miss Tang.

186
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,420
Your knack for scheming
is quite impressive.

187
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,259
Your Highness, you're jesting.

188
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,139
I tend

189
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,139
to avoid conflict,

190
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,499
but if provoked,

191
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,060
I ensure consequences.

192
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,180
Which book

193
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,300
did you learn all these skills from?

194
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,658
Not from books.

195
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,139
Through personal experience.

196
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,779
When you reach the depths of despair,

197
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,180
you can let go of everything.

198
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,859
I hope you won't experience my schemes,
Your Highness.

199
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,340
Are you threatening me?

200
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,499
I dare not.

201
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,099
It's merely a friendly reminder.

202
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,139
Wan.

203
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,460
Why are you here?

204
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,820
I brewed a calming soup
based on my mother's recipe.

205
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,420
You're been through a lot last time.

206
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,580
What are you...

207
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,499
I...

208
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,538
I'll explain later.

209
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,458
Let's have the soup first.

210
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,220
Let's go.

211
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,379
Your room is over there.

212
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,139
Look.

213
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,578
The moon is beautiful tonight.

214
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:51,899
How about a walk?

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,698
Let's go.

216
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,379
Meow.

217
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,779
What's that sound?

218
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,580
It's a wild cat.

219
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,220
There have been many stray cats
here lately.

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,779
Let's go.

221
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,379
Tell me.

222
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,259
What kind of person

223
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,859
starts off naive

224
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,619
but becomes quite astute?

225
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:27,578
Perhaps

226
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,298
that's her nature.

227
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,060
She just hid it well before.

228
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,379
Or maybe

229
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,499
she's suffered deeply in the past

230
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,979
and experienced life and death,

231
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
so she was

232
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,739
reborn.

233
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,899
Reborn

234
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,580
after experiencing life and death.

235
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,940
