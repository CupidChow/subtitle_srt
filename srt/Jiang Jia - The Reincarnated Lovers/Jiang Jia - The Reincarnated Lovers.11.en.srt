=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,440
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,260
Your Highness.

4
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,740
Master Tang.

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,420
I apologize for my tardiness.

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,540
You have a busy schedule.

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
No need to apologize for it.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,220
May I ask

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,700
what are these for?

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,900
It's our first visit.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,240
I brought some small gifts.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,700
I hope you like it.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,580
Your Highness, thank you.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,060
Weren't you going
to the temple for prayers?

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,340
Why did you suddenly come?

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,300
Just passing by.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,880
I happened to have something

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,580
to discuss with your father.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,060
He left midway

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,380
just to escort that witch home.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,300
It seems like

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,940
they had some kind of potion.

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,180
First Qing'an,

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,060
and now Xuanyi.

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,500
Your Highness.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,660
Don't be angry.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,890
It's not good for your body.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,860
I believe

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,780
Xuanyi has his own considerations.

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,980
Jingyue.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,380
You and Xuanyi

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,020
have been childhood friends,

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,500
growing up together.

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm aware

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,220
of your feelings for Xuanyi.

36
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,500
You should have been

37
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,380
Xuanyi's wife.

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,860
Your Highness.

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,340
I don't want anything.

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,540
I just hope

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
to accompany you.

42
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
Good child.

43
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,820
What official business is in such a hurry?

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,040
It's related to Jiangling.

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,140
It's confidential.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,980
Your Highness.

47
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,980
Please come inside.

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,740
This way.

49
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,940
No rush.

50
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,860
I was curious.

51
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,140
Do you two have any issues

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,590
with the marriage His Majesty arranged?

53
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,620
You not only made the Queen
walk barefoot over a fire basin

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,690
but also spread rumors
about the Kind of Jiangling's residence

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
being dissatisfied with the Queen,

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,780
even speculating that I intend

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,890
to issue a letter of divorce.

58
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,980
We dare not.

59
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,940
We just...

60
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,660
Madam Meng, your face

61
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,340
sure recovers fast.

62
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,380
Your Highness.

63
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,020
Your Highness.

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
What is this for?

65
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,780
To step over a fire basin.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,760
♪Outside the city,

Your Highness.

89
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,500
Wanwan?

90
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
Wanwan.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,460
Your Highness.

92
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,140
Did you just have a dream about me?

93
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,140
I didn't.

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,980
Don't talk nonsense.

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,660
Why were you

96
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,220
calling my name repeatedly then?

97
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,340
Impossible.

98
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,140
You must have misheard.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,680
Go back to sleep.

100
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,940
Tang Yin'er.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
What were you
sneaking around my room for?

102
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,590
None of your business.

103
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,220
Don't meddle in my affairs.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,660
What's that thing in your hand?

105
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,540
Nothing.

106
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,340
This is my belonging.

107
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,020
So what?

108
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,340
I'm going to destroy it.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,050
Give it to me.

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,860
Give it to me.

111
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,780
Tang Wanwan.

112
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,620
I know you made a pact with Qing'an

113
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,480
to give him this item
on your wedding night.

114
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,180
I also know

115
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,740
that those with lovebird jade pendants

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,790
are fated
to be connected through lifetimes.

117
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,660
But you don't deserve
to meet Qing'an again.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,290
Your Highness, aren't you
discussing official matters with Father?

119
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,460
How did you return so soon?

120
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,300
You don't want me to return soon?

121
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,780
It's not...

122
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:04,860
that.

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,540
Really?

124
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
But I can see

125
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,540
that right now,

126
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,340
you wish the one standing

127
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,740
before you is Xiao Qing'an.

128
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,580
Am I right?

129
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,780
Your Highness.

130
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,460
You...

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,620
People who possess the pendants

132
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,860
are destined to be connected
through lifetimes.

133
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,620
What a wonderful symbolism.

134
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,980
This pendant

135
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,900
has been with me since birth.

136
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,780
It has special meaning to me.

137
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,180
Please return it to me.

138
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,700
Is it the item that's special,

139
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,220
or the person?

140
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,660
Perhaps you're using this pendant
to reminisce

141
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
about someone special?

142
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,740
Yes.

143
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,500
I did promise Qing'an,

144
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,860
but I didn't...

145
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
(Baiye Pavilion)

146
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,540
- Welcome, our new pavilion master.
- Welcome, our new pavilion master.

147
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,420
Give it back.

148
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,100
Thanks.

149
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,900
I didn't say it was for you.

150
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,740
Do you know

151
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,300
the significance of this pendant?

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,100
I like it,

153
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,940
so it's mine now.

154
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,500
Give it back.

155
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,020
This isn't fair.

156
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,420
He got it from you

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,330
while I had to take it forcefully.

158
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,740
Who cares?

159
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,690
Do you like vinegar?
[*Eat vinegar = to be jealous]

160
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,540
No, I...

161
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,500
The soup buns are authentic

162
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,780
when enjoyed with a dash of vinegar.

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,780
I'm not jealous at all.

164
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,940
Your Highness.

165
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
Why is your right cheek

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,300
so red?

167
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,540
It's a mosquito bite.

168
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,060
There shouldn't

169
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,740
be any mosquitoes in this weather.

170
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,260
It's a mosquito that loves soup buns.

171
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,060
Let's hurry up.

172
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,820
Mother is waiting for us at the door.

173
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,020
I...

174
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,660
Mother, why did you come

175
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,290
to pick us up
at the Minister's residence?

176
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,660
It was Jingyue's idea.

177
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,260
She said we might as well

178
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,740
pick you two up on the way back.

179
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,980
Jingyue even

180
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,780
got a double blessing token for you.

181
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,980
Jingyue is truly our lucky star.

182
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,820
Flowers bloom anew.

183
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,220
Youth comes just once.

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,020
Hopes become reality.

185
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,660
Dreams do come true.

186
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
(Flowers bloom anew.)

187
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,740
(Youth comes just once.)

188
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,660
Your Highness.

189
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,700
We're ambushed.

190
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,060
Put down your weapons,

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,860
