=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,679
Miss Tang, thank you for your efforts.

4
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,020
Your Highness has been
talking with my father a lot lately

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,650
and now wants to inspect the accounts

6
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,670
of the Minister's residence.

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,960
What exactly is this for?

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,520
It's for you.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
Just kidding.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,679
Miss Tang.

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,520
Whether it's the frequent conversations
with your father

12
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,399
or examining the accounts,

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
it's all part of my routine duties.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,200
(Xiao Xuanyi has shown special interest
in the Minister's residence lately.)

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,760
(Could it be related)

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
(to the false accusation
that Father conspired)

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,980
(with Xiliang for rebellion
in my past life?)

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
Miss Tang.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,719
Why are you looking at me so?

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,000
It seems since we met,

21
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,599
you've been treating me like this.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,439
It is as if we

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,000
have some deep-seated enmity.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Miss Tang.

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
Are you feeling guilty?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm not sure
what Your Highness is referring to.

27
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,719
I had a tough childhood
due to my heterochromia

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,719
and early loss of my mother.

29
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,599
To protect myself,

30
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,359
I've grown more cautious.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,640
Your Highness.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,170
Now that the account books are here,

33
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,719
I shall take my leave.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,759
Tang Wanwan.

35
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,319
Wan.

36
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,800
Qing'an.

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,870
Father asked me to deliver the accounts
of the Minister's residence

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,800
to His Highness.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,560
What a coincidence.

40
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,039
I was just looking for you.

41
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,759
I heard that the Paradise Restaurant
is opening today.

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,919
It features many tasty Xiliang cuisine.

43
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,599
Let's go and try something new.

44
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,599
I've always known

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,080
that you treat me the best, Qing'an.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Xuanyi.

47
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,719
Are you coming too?

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
His Highness is busy.

49
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,479
I'm sure he has no time.

50
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,199
Who said I don't have time?

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,680
I'm going.

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
(Paradise Restaurant)

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,599
Wan.

54
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,319
Try this.

55
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,680
It's a Xiliang cuisine.

56
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,560
Okay.

57
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,919
You too.

58
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,680
This osmanthus lotus seed soup

59
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,800
is delicious.

60
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,319
(Wasn't he allergic to osmanthus?)

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
(Did his allergies
change in this life too?)

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,280
(Whatever.)

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,759
(What do I care)

64
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,879
(if he lives or dies?)

65
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,800
Dear esteemed guests,

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,360
I am truly honored

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
that you could come today.

68
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,599
Are you satisfied with the dishes?

69
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,520
Young Master Hua,
you're from Xiliang Province.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,599
No wonder the food

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
is authentic.

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,199
Young Master Qing'an,
if you like the food,

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,990
the catering for your
and Miss Tang's wedding banquets

74
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,599
will be on me.

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,199
Thank you, Young Master Hua.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Wan.

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,639
That's great!

78
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes.

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,319
Enjoy your meal.

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,639
Your Highness.

81
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,879
(I'm allergic to osmanthus.)

82
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,840
(Tang Wanwan knew that in the past.)

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,599
(I purposely
had osmanthus soup before her today,)

84
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,520
(but she showed no reaction.)

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
(Could it be an act?)

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,400
(I'll have to test her again.)

87
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,120
Tang Wanwan.

88
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,279
Wan.

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,399
Your Highness.

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,639
You're drunk.

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,879
Wanwan.

92
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,279
Wanwan.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
You're drunk.
Go back to your residence.

94
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't behave recklessly here.

95
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
I think I'm having an allergic reaction.

96
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,160
All these years,

97
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,850
I served as a military advisor
in Jiangling

98
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,120
to help you secretly seize the throne.

99
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,800
I established Baiye Pavilion
and trained assassins

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,519
all for you.

101
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,079
Yet, you always
obeyed the Princess Dowager.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,839
Now that Xiao Xuanyi has returned,

103
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,360
you are still indifferent.

104
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,519
Master.

105
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,879
But Mother is not

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,319
as unbearable as you describe.

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,240
Before Xuanyi

108
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,800
was in Jiangling Province,

109
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,079
she focused all her attention on me.

110
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,560
She treated me like her own child.

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,839
She was bewildering you.

112
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,759
She didn't want you
to compete with her son for the throne.

113
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,519
I'm just a son born to a concubine.

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,279
I have no desire for the throne.

115
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,480
In this life,

116
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,639
I only wish

117
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,639
for a lifetime

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
with one soulmate.

119
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,720
Qing'an.

120
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,839
You're really foolish.

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
I have to go to the Minister's residence now.

122
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,560
I promised your birth mother

123
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
I would take good care of you.

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
If anyone tries to stop you
from becoming the Prince of Jiangling,

125
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll eliminate them one by one.

126
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm uncomfortable.

127
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,519
Itchy.

128
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,160
How can you act spoiled
after drinking too much?

129
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,279
So itchy.

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
Uncomfortable.

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,680
Itchy.

132
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,519
You're not mindful of your allergies.

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,480
Serves you right.

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,759
Do you know

135
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,319
why I'm allergic?

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,300
♪Distant mountains
resemble the hues of your eyebrows♪

137
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,040
♪Recalling innocent laughter
by the bridge of two little ones♪

138
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Your face

139
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,040
is so red.

140
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,879
I

141
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
am just hot.

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm very hot.

143
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,639
The weather is too hot.

144
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,560
Is that so?

145
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Wan.

146
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
Why did Qing'an come?

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,079
(She seems unaware of her past life.)

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,399
(I may be overthinking.)

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,519
Qing'an.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
It's late at night.

151
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,759
Why did you come?

152
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
My mother left this
for her daughter-in-law.

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
I couldn't

154
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,319
wait to give it to you.

155
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,560
Okay.

156
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,639
What's wrong?

157
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,240
Are you feeling unwell?

158
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm fine.

159
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm just a bit

160
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,920
too tired.

161
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,720
Anyway,

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,560
it's late.

163
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,680
You should rest early, too.

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,480
Good night.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Good night.

166
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,839
Wan.

167
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,040
Your Highness.

168
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,319
You have an ulcer on your lips.

169
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,879
Osmanthus tea

170
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,040
cools and detoxifies.

171
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,519
I left out osmanthus
because I knew you're allergic.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,639
(After several attempts,)

173
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,879
(it seems)

174
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,120
(she doesn't remember her past life.)

175
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,959
Tang Sicheng's concubine

176
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,680
resents Tang Wanwan for a long time.

177
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,410
Now, she has

178
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,560
bribed mountain bandits

179
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
to abduct Tang Wanwan

180
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,319
on her wedding day

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,720
and let the bandits violate her.

182
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
I will

183
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,959
lend her a hand.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,919
(Tang Wanwan.)

185
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,240
(You should be happy.)

186
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,799
(You've finally escaped your past fate.)

187
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,679
(Everything is different now.)

188
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,360
(You have a new life)

189
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,519
(without him.)

190
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,990
