(Letter of Divorce

00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,419
(Letter of Divorce
Signed by Tang Wanwan)

5
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,019
You and I
are destined for different fates

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,899
I'll find a way to divorce you
if we get married.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,000
So,

8
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,399
here's the letter of divorce

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,919
to save ourselves the trouble.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,800
Good.

11
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,800
How brilliant.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,359
That's fine.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,219
Fate

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,879
can't be forced.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,359
The second request

17
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:50,779
is that I wish

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,639
to marry Qing'an.

19
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,578
I'm willing to join him

20
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,359
in showing filial piety
to Your Highness.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,319
Well.

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,658
In my humble opinion,

23
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:04,498
this might

24
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,559
be inappropriate.

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,600
Miss Tang just
ended her engagement with His Highness,

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,840
and now she wants
to get engaged to Qing'an.

27
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:13,978
If this gets out,

28
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,439
it won't look good for us.

29
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:18,359
Mr. Zhuge.

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,559
What you say makes sense.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,840
I ask for nothing else.

32
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,939
I just

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,719
want to marry Qing'an.

34
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,200
As you wish.

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,159
The two of us

36
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,600
are no longer engaged.

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,819
Lord Tang's daughter will

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,600
marry my elder brother.

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,240
How wonderful.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,999
May the two of you

41
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,760
love each other

42
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,218

Master Tang.

00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,200

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,239
No need to worry much.

00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,000
Wan and Qing'an are in love.

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,440
I wouldn't break up a loving couple.

69
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,899
Besides,

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,720
she'll be my daughter-in-law either way.

71
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,359
Your Highness, you're righteous,

72
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,639
and I'm extremely grateful for that.

73
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,040
(What a wench.)

74
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,040
(She managed to engage with Qing'an.)

75
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,040
I finally took this step.

76
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,799
Xiao Xuanyi.

77
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,299
You and I

78
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,880
have no more ties in this life.

79
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,239
Yin'er.

80
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,560
I...

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,019
You've had too much to drink.

82
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,399
Let me help you back.

83
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,239
Qing'an.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,760
Xuanyi.

85
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,119
Just now,

86
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,179
Wan...

87
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,679
Miss Tang and I

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,600
only met briefly.

89
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,359
But you and her

90
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,000
have been childhood friends.

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,760
You two are a perfect match.

92
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,440
But the way you two

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,919
interacted earlier made me feel like

94
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,720
you've known each other long.

95
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,320
You two have a kind

96
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,480
of past-life connection.

97
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,919
You're just overthinking.

98
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,320
Congratulations

99
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,000
on finding a good woman.

100

Xuanyi.

101
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

102
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,000
I have something to do.

103
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,079
Tang Wanwan.

104
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,000
Tang Wanwan?

105
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,778
How dare you get engaged with Qing'an.

106
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll make you infamous.

107
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,000
(You want to set me up again.)

108
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,000
(I won't be tricked again.)

109
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,479
(They're here early.)

111
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,320
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,159
Didn't I give you the letter of divorce?

113
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,519
Stay quiet.

114
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,579
Sweetheart.

115
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,200
You must have waited long.

116
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,200

138
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,459
Wake them up now.

139
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,440
Yes.

140
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,619
Miss Yin'er.

141
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,839
Wake up.

142
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,538
Mother.

143
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:57,760
Tidy up yourself.

144
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,079
There's someone over there.

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,959
It's you two?

146
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,200
Wan.

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,719
Your Highness.

148
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,538
Why were you

149
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,778
alone with him

150
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,240
in the room?

151
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,499
Your Highness.

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,499
Why even ask?

153
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,858
It's because Tang Wanwan
is flirtatious and unrestrained.

154
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:35,959
Miss Yin'er.

155
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:37,200
Watch your words.

156
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,680
I went to the restroom earlier.

157
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,059
I came back to find Yin'er missing.

158
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,738
His Highness happened to pass by,

159
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,240
saying he was lost.

160
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,858
I wanted to help him find his way.

161
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,658
Unexpectedly, I felt dizzy

162
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,920
and almost lost my balance.

163
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,320
His Highness was kind

164
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,479
and helped me into the room.

165
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,159
What Miss Tang said

166
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,000
was true.

167
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:03,819
Soon

168
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,240
after we came in,

169
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,079
we heard a disgusting flirtatious voice.

170
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,880
We quickly hid.

171
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,560
Then,

172
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,479
we saw Yin'er and Young Master Hua...

173
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,338
So, we didn't

174
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,680
dare to come out.

175
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,499
Tang Wanwan!

176
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,139
You're talking nonsense.

177
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,120
Wench. I'll teach you...

178
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,418
Yin'er.

179
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,119
Why are you so careless?

180
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:37,640
Second Madam.

181
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,219
If you still have doubts,

182
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,658
we can go to the courtyard,

183
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,320
and I can explain it in public.

184
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,479
But since

185
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,560
Young Master Hua hasn't woken up yet,

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,578
we can only trouble everyone

187
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:50,879
to come in here.

188
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,479
Wait.

189
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,239
Yin'er is still single,

190
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,440
so I'd like to ask you

191
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,359
not to publicize this matter.

192
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,239
Second Madam.

193
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,999
I dare not go against your wish.

194
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,099
Besides,

195
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,759
Yin'er is my younger sister.

196
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,859
However,

197
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,520
what she did

198
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,698
is bad

199
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:17,560
for our family's image, isn't it?

200
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,599
Get up.

201
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:24,839
Let's leave.

202
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,680
Miss Tang is truly eloquent,

203
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,200
fabricating lies so effortlessly.

204
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,458
If I hadn't done that,

205
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,938
with the situation earlier,

206
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,800
we wouldn't have been able
to explain ourselves.

207
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,040
You should thank me.

208
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,019
It's not good

209
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,400
for your reputation either.

210
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:14,759
Are you

211
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,520
concerned about me?

212
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,418
Xiao Xuanyi.

213
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,879
I don't care why you come to my room,

214
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,680
but I hope from now on,

215
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,440
we'll keep our distance.

216
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,119
There should
be no more physical contact.

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,400
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

218
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:41,619
Your Highness.

219
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,339
What is it?

220
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,440
The spy reports Tang Yin'er

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,599
to be in contact

222
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,200
with several desperadoes lately.

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,239
They might do Miss Wanwan harm.

224
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:49,778
Shall we...

225
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:50,859
No need.

226
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,959
Her affairs

227
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,560
are none of my concern.

228
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,719
Understood.

229
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,079
(I'm trying my best
to avoid any ties with Xiao Xuanyi,)

230
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,778
(and I'm officially)

231
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,719
(engaged to Qing'an now.)

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,560
(Things are unfolding differently
from the previous life.)

233
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,440
(But the false accusation
against my father...)

234
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,359
You owe me a favor now.

235
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,400
No need to pretend to be kind.

236
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,719
Why...

237
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,079
Are you okay?

238
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,640
Hey.

239
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:00,999
Hey.

240
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:06,999
His blood is black.

241
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,839
The arrow had poison.

242
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,359
(Tang Wanwan.)

243
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,458
(If he dies,)

245
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,599
(will be solved.)

246
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,599
