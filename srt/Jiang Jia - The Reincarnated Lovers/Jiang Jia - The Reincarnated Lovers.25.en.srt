00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,720
=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,839
(Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.,
meet me by the lake. Hanya.)

4
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:32,880
Your Highness.

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,000
Young Master Hanya.

6
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,079
(I'm sorry.)

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,119
(Wan.)

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,000
It's getting late.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,679
Why isn't Wanwan back yet?

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,399
Do you know

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,439
where she went?

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,280
I don't know,

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,520
but I saw her

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,159
leaving this morning.

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:03,960
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,000
Your Highness.

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,990
(Wedding Invitation)
Someone sent this over.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,500
(Master of Baiye Pavilion's Wedding)

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,359
Welcome

21
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,200
to Baiye Pavilion.

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,799
Why did you bring me here?

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,159
To get married.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,120
Faking a marriage

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,280
to lure Xiao Xuanyi to Baiye Pavilion

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,199
and trap him here.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
What a clever plan.

28
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,639
To ensure everything goes smoothly,

29
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,759
I came to look for you

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
to borrow some help.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,970
Who would have expected the top
assassin organization in the world,

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,400
Baiye Pavilion,
to have a shortage of hands?

33
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,120
I don't have many people here.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,890
After all, we need to stay hidden,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
and having a large force
wouldn't be convenient.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Once Xiao Xuanyi dies

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,599
and Jiangling Province is in chaos,

38
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,280
we'll get Qing'an to ascend the throne.

39
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
When we
head to Tian Capital to get appointed,

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,199
we'll cooperate
with your father from inside the city.

41
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,080
It'll only be a matter of time

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,319
before we take over Tian Capital.

43
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,520
What do you think?

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,199
Sure.

45
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,360
But I'm curious

46
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,520
about where Tang Wanwan will end up.

47
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,840
I never leave myself a way out,

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,639
nor do I leave a way out for the enemy.

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,719
Bow to the Heaven and Earth.

50
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Zhuge Ye.

52
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,400
So, it's you.

53
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,759
Xuanyi.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,159
Xiao Xuanyi.

55
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,840
You're finally here.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,919
Qing'an.

57
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,520
Wan.

58
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,840
That's impossible.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,199
Wan.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,279
Xuanyi.

61
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,920
You're awake.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,279
How could you be so foolish?

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,890
Why did you
jump into such an obvious trap?

64
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,879
I was worried about you.

65
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,519
But

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,399
don't worry.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
If we aren't back

68
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,759
by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow,

69
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,759
Zhu Que

70
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,240
will come with troops.

71
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,720
What if we

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,079
can't make it until then?

73
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,959
We'll die together,

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,800
like how we did in our past life.

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,580
(Qingluan)

76
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,639
Tomorrow

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
is the anniversary
of your mother's death.

78
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,720
On that day,

79
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,199
I'm going to send Yuan Xia's son
to his death

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,920
to console your mother's spirit.

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,519
Master.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you sure you won't harm Wan?

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,639
Of course.

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,680
How could I deceive you?

85
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,879
In my past life,

86
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,639
I found that Zhuge Ye

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,480
used bamboo slips to frame your father.

88
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,759
The evidence was overwhelming.

89
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,439
According to the law,

90
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,560
rebels and their families
have to be wiped out.

91
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,879
Your father
was determined to protect you,

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,519
so he found me beforehand.

93
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,879
Master Tang.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,279
I know you're loyal and courageous,

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,920
so you must have been framed.

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,680
But with concrete evidence

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,240
and the chaotic situation,

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I am

99
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,079
unable to protect you.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,079
Don't worry.

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
Give me some more time.

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,639
Your Highness, I'm deeply grateful

103
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,720
for your kindness.

104
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,560
I came here today

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,959
to ask if you
could expedite the wedding.

106
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,560
Once Wanwan marries you,

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,360
she'll become a member of your family

108
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,920
and will no longer be affected by us.

109
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,879
But...

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
Please, Your Highness.

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,560
I promise you.

112
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,199
That's why I expedited our wedding.

114
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,519
So that's why.

115
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,279
My father, he...

116
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,439
Never seek revenge.

117
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
Stay in the Prince's residence forever.

118
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,720
Xiao Xuanyi will definitely...

119
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,079
He will...

120
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,480
Father.

121
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,639
But why did Zhuge Ye frame my father?

122
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,480
Could he have done this

123
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,759
because he...

124
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,660
For the title
of the Prince of Jiangling.

125
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,519
But Zhuge Ye
can't become the Prince of Jiangling.

126
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,279
So, the person

127
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,879
he wants to support is Xiao Qing'an.

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
You guys leave.

129
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,399
Yes.

130
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,160
Qingluan.

131
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,439
Yuan Xia killed you,

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
and now

133
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,199
I've captured her son

134
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,879
to get him to make amends.

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,000
Zhuge Ye.

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,839
Surrender now.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,079
How can this be?

138
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,879
Xuanyi.

139
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,039
Wan.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,320
The smoke you saw during the day

141
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
was violet smoke.

142
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,759
It makes people weak
and easily manipulable.

143
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Take these pills.

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,600
If you ingest them,

145
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,960
you'll be immune to the smoke's effects.

146
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Qing'an.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
I have never thought about harming you.

148
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,639
I know.

149
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,559
Qing'an.

150
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,799
You're making a mistake.

151
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
You still have time.

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,519
Kill them.

153
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,559
Master.

154
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,840
That's enough.

155
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm sure Mother

156
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,960
wouldn't want to see us like this.

157
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,799
Let's not make any more mistakes.

158
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,360
Stop this.

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,679
I, Zhuge Ye,

160
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,360
have an unyielding ambition

161
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
and I'm not afraid of death.

162
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,440
Back then, I brought Qingluan
to pledge allegiance to Xiao Cheng.

163
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I served him faithfully.

164
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
But what did he do?

165
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,480
He took Qingluan away from me,

166
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,840
and your mother killed her.

167
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,000
Ten years of hard studying,

168
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
I still
couldn't withstand those in power.

169
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,240
Mother has never
thought about harming Madam Qingluan.

170
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,320
Instead, she often mentioned her,

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
saying she failed to care for her.

172
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,600
She died from difficult labor.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,679
Nonsense.

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,519
Do you know

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
how your father died?

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,759
I killed him.

177
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,639
Before he died,

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
he looked as pitiful as a homeless dog.

179
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,559
As for how your mother

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
ended up in such a state,

181
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,679
it's because I

182
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,960
ordered Lin Jingyue to do it.
