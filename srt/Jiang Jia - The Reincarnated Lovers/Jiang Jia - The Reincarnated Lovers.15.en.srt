2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,000
I've explained it all.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,760
But you didn't trust us.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Us?

6
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,239
Tang Wanwan.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,440
You're including him, too?

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,280
What?

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,600
Can't I?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,679
You can.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,079
You absolutely can.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,920
You connected instantly,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,100
as if old friends reunited.

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,280
It was indeed quite a gift

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,079
for my birthday celebration.

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,799
Wait.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,200
Why stole my jade pendant?

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,679
What do you mean by that?

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,280
I just happened to find it.

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,439
Why haven't you returned it to me, then?

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,879
Do I need

22
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,680
to remember your useless pendant
among my treasures?

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,000
You're right.

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,920
Your mind

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,959
is used up remembering colors.

26
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,840
What?

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,400
Princess Jingyue
likes the color dark purple.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,519
You remembered it for years

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,000
and even specifically
gifted her fabric from Xiliang.

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,040
However,

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,040
I have to thank you, Your Highness,

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,400
for gifting me a piece, too.

33
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,200
Are you

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,599
jealous?

35
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,159
I'm not.

36
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,719
I'm just amazed

37
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,159
at your bond with Princess Jingyue.

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,560
Look at you.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
You are jealous.

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm not.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
Oh, really?

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,439
The color dark purple

43
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,840
embodies preciousness,

44
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,799
elegance,

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,239
and generosity.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,719
It suits

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,759
Princess Jingyue perfectly.

48
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,919
You carry grace and elegance

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,919
while she
exudes the sophistication of wealth.

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,599
Truly enviable.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Young Master Hanya

52
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,120
is also skilled in arts and warfare,

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
attracting

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,960
countless infatuated admirers.

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,950
He cherishes tenderness,
beauty, and life's romance.

56
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,039
Naturally, he's an ideal partner

57
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,000
in a maiden's heart.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,919
Why you.

59
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,479
Queen of Jiangling.

60
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,680
Prince of Jiangling.

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,719
Young Master Hanya.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,159
You're everywhere.

63
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,199
I'm worried

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
that night's event

65
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,439
might affect your relationship
with Her Highness.

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Not at all.

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Our bond

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
is unbreakable.

69
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,360
We trust each other.

70
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,960
This is the weed

71
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,199
from the woodshed that night.

72
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,439
There's a fragrance on it.

73
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,840
It's cornus water.

74
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,199
In essence,

75
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,280
the note you received
was made of blue sandalwood.

76
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,439
Combined with that herb, it acted

77
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,560
as an aphrodisiac.

78
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,719
This is only my speculation.

79
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,919
Unfortunately,

80
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,280
the note was destroyed in the fire,

81
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,159
so we can't verify it now.

82
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,560
Alas.

83
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,520
Who on earth

84
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,560
would plot against me?

85
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,719
I will thoroughly

86
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,039
investigate this matter.

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,919
Wanwan.

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,759
Restrain yourself.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's still around.

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
What?

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,079
Good girl.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
You did well.

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,600
As expected from the one
I've had my eye on.

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,519
No need to inform pavilion master
about this.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I fear he might

96
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,800
be soft-hearted.

97
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,000
Understood.

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,680
Inform Lv Qiao.

99
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,360
Go.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,399
Mother.

101
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,279
Mother.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,519
How have you been feeling lately?

103
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,000
Lately, Her Highness

104
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,439
has been fatigued

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
with severe headaches.

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,590
There's no improvement,

107
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,839
even with the medicine.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
Your Highness.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,839
Lv Qiao found something

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,560
while tidying Her Highness' room...

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Your Highness, I found this thing.

112
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
Your name

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
is inscribed on it,

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,120
along with the date of birth.

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,639
Be careful with your words.

116
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,600
Tian Capital has long
forbidden such witchcraft.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,199
Be it royalty

118
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,600
or commoners,

119
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,959
those practicing it

120
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,279
face execution by law.

121
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,720
No wonder

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,439
I've been feeling unwell.

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,199
Tang Wanwan.

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,920
You witch.

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,839
Mother.

126
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,800
This is suspicious.

127
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,639
His Highness is still outside.

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,199
I hope to wait for his return

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,279
before making a decision.

130
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,839
Yes.

131
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,120
Although this Voodoo doll

132
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,959
was found in Wanwan's belongings,

133
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,360
I believe

134
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,439
she wouldn't

135
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,360
harbor such malicious intentions
toward you.

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Don't speak up for her.

137
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Guards.

138
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,600
Take Tang Wanwan
to the dungeon for questioning.

139
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,959
Wanwan is in trouble?

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Where is she?

141
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
In the dungeon.

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,240
Your Highness.

143
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,399
(Accusations)
Think it through.

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
Just admit your accusation,

145
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,160
and you don't have to suffer.

146
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,160
It wasn't me.

147
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,079
