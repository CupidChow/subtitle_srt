=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,280
No, thank you.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,600
I can't take it.

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,120
Mother, what are you doing?

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,280
No matter if you acknowledge her or not,

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,719
Wanwan

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,799
will always be my wife.

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,000
Xuanyi.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,250
You're only momentarily
infatuated with her.

11
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,039
I'll make it clear to you.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,039
Even if this is a marriage
bestowed by His Majesty,

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,759
I will not acknowledge a witch
as my daughter-in-law.

14
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,079
Your Highness.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,280
Please don't get angry.

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,759
You've just recovered.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,690
Getting angry isn't good for recovery.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,920
Xuanyi is right.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,479
I believe Wanwan meant well.

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,719
The Perescia plant isn't easy to find.

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,200
Let's accept it.

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,840
(In our previous life,)

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,000
(I'd never heard Xiao Xuanyi
mention Princess Jingyue.)

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
(They seem)

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,319
(quite close?)

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,790
(Why am I thinking about it?)

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,990
(These don't concern me.)

28
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,920
Tang Wanwan.

29
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,400
Are you asleep?

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
You're a grownup,

31
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,199
yet you still do things so recklessly.

32
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,080
Wan.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Wan.

34
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,039
Wan.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,319
Qing'an.

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
Your injuries are too severe.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,280
It's already a miracle

38
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,680
for you to be alive.

39
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,759
Remember.

40
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,790
It was Xiao Xuanyi

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,560
who caused you to be in so much pain.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,879
While you're suffering,

43
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,639
Xiao Xuanyi

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,919
has taken everything away from you.

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,319
(Is Xiao Xuanyi)

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,759
(applying ointment on my hand?)

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,479
(Oh no.)

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,719
(My nose is itching.)

49
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,919
(Oh no.)

50
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,039
(I'm going to...)

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Were you awake the whole time?

52
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,439
Yes.

53
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,039
You were injured
while searching for the antidote.

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,159
I've always been fair.

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,039
Your reward.

56
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,680
Apply it three times a day.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,690
You're welcome.

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,639
By the way, are you

60
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,159
and Hua Xingyan close?

61
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,199
No.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,990
Then why did you
go to the mountain with him?

63
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,199
He's from Xiliang Province

64
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,970
and is familiar with the Perescia plant.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
That's why I called him.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,080
I knew it.

67
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,720
I

68
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,519
was just asking.

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,790
Oh, right.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,959
Mother wants Princess Jingyue

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,360
to stay in Jiangling for a while.

72
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,040
Her whole family died in the war,

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,439
and His Majesty adopted her.

74
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,000
She grew up with me.

75
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,160
You don't have
to explain anything to me.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,570
Your Highness.

77
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,370
Where are you going?

78
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,890
I don't have to explain it to you.

79
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,439
Gosh.

80
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,600
(What's wrong with him?)

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
(He's so emotional.)

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Zhu Que.

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
If a wife

84
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,639
doesn't care much

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
about her husband's relationship

86
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,879
with another woman,

87
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,439
does that mean

88
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,639
the wife

89
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,759
doesn't care much about her husband?

90
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,879
I knew it.

91
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,199
But

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
it's not that she doesn't care much.

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,240
It should be

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
that she never cared.

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,839
There's another situation.

96
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,600
What is it?

97
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,639
It means

98
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,759
that woman already
has someone in her heart.

99
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,190
Your Highness.

100
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,639
Everything's ready.

101
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,519
Today is Memorial Day.

102
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,360
You all should
come with me to pray at the temple.

103
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,120
Your Highness.

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,920
Today is also the day Miss Tang
needs to visit her parents.

105
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,560
Is it?

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,480
Then you follow her home.

107
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,000
Xuanyi won't be going.

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not right for the groom not to go.

109
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,759
How dare you speak out of turn?

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,879
Hongdou.

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Your Highness.

112
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,480
Your servant

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,759
needs to learn some manners.

114
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,319
Miss Tang.

115
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,040
Are you alright?

116
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,480
Your Highness.

117
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,000
You should let Xuanyi

118
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,759
accompany Wanwan home.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,800
Otherwise,

120
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,519
it would not look good for Wanwan

121
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,759
to return home alone after marriage.

122
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,199
That would be quite pitiful.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,959
Jingyue.

124
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Don't speak up for her.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
What do you think, Xuanyi?

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,079
Mother wants Princess Jingyue

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
to stay in Jiangling for a while.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,959
Her whole family died in the war,

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,920
and His Majesty adpoted her.

130
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,480
She grew up with me.

131
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,160
You don't have to explain anything.

132
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
If a wife

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,879
doesn't care much
about her husband's relationship

134
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,360
with another woman,

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,839
does that mean

136
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,399
the wife
doesn't care much about her husband?

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,319
It's not that she doesn't care much.

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
It should be

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
that she never cared.

140
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,639
I

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,959
would rather accompany you and Jingyue

142
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
to the temple.

143
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,420
(The Minister's Residence)

144
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,759
Father.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,920
I'm home.

146
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,040
Wanwan.

147
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,000
My dear daughter.

148
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,680
You're home.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,079
You're finally home.

150
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
Come on. Let's go.

151
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,639
Wait a minute.

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,759
A witch returning home

153
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,650
should step over a brazier
to dispel bad luck.

154
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,040
Wanwan.

155
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,600
We don't intend to treat you badly,

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,199
but we have no choice.

157
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,920
You see,

158
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,720
you caused your first husband's death
on your wedding day.

159
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,040
Then, on your second wedding,

160
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,160
you brought illness
to your mother-in-law and many citizens.

161
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,160
Nonsense.

162
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,120
Those aren't Wanwan's fault.

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,120
Wanwan.

164
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,680
Don't listen to them.

165
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't cross over

166
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,319
this brazier.

167
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,799
Father.

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,720
It's fine.

169
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,840
It's only a brazier.

170
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
It's Jiangling's tradition
for the newlywed wife

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,990
to cross over the brazier barefooted

172
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,039
when she returns home
without her husband.

173
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,039
Besides,

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
with the bad luck you have on you,

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,490
you should cross over this barefooted.

176
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,159
Yin'er.

177
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,960
Watch your tone.

178
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,720
Master.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,759
Yin'er's words are rude but reasonable.

180
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,039
The new bride returning home
is a grand occasion,

181
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,559
and we haven't even seen her husband.

182
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,639
I suspect Prince of Jiangling
is dissatisfied with Wanwan.

183
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,480
It's possible that we might

184
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,770
receive a letter of divorce soon.

185
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,240
Whose letter of divorce?
