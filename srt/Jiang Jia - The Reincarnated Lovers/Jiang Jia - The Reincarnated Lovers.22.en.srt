=The Reincarnated Lovers=

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,920
What?

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,160
You want to exhume the body?

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,359
According to legend, Muye Province

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,079
has an ancient method of solving cases

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,039
called the Red Umbrella Autopsy.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,359
Dig out a cellar

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,559
and put in charcoal.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,990
Then, heat the walls until they're red
and remove the charcoal.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,719
Pour in good liquor,

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,320
add vinegar,

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,359
then put the cleaned corpse inside.

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,719
Lastly, cover it with bamboo mats.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,719
After two hours,

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,719
take out the corpse,

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,439
place it in the sunlight,

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,320
and open a red umbrella over it.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,159
Then, you can solve the case
by examining the corpse.

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,880
The deceased should be honored.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,479
May they rest in peace.

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,079
Exhuming the coffin for reexamination
might not be appropriate.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,039
As for Lord Tang...

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,399
I've already

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,960
discussed this matter with him.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,640
What's most important

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,719
is to find the murderer immediately.

28
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,000
Jingyue.

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,200
How's your hand?

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,959
Mother.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm fine.

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,980
(Tang Yin'er's grave)

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,359
Lin Jingyue.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,640
It was you.

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,220
(Prince of Jiangling's residence)

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,159
That's what happened.

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,680
I hope you can see through this.

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,159
Jingyue.

39
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,159
Do you have anything else to say?

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,840
After hearing about

41
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,530
the investigation method
in Muye Province,

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,180
I wanted to help Wanwan clear her name

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
by opening the coffin
as soon as possible.

44
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,599
So why did you
disguise yourself like this,

45
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,079
and why did you hastily
flee after encountering me

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,319
and His Highness?

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
It's because...

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,439
It's because you killed Tang Yin'er.

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,480
You even gave her a coagulation pill

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,159
to mess up her time of death.

51
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,680
Wanwan.

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,439
How have I offended you

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,439
for you
to hold such a grudge against me?

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Mother.

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm innocent.

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I raised Jingyue myself,

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
so I

58
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,159
know her temperament best.

59
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,680
She couldn't even hurt a fly,

60
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,919
so how could she manage to kill someone?

61
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,919
Your Highness.

62
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,680
What Princess Jingyue did

63
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,400
might be far more

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,759
than just murder.

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,159
Xuanyi.

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,639
We grew up together.

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,319
I know

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,439
you must have been blinded by others.

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,719
Back then,

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,360
several Jiangling citizens
were foaming at the mouth,

71
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,439
and the sorcerer admitted

72
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,240
that a man wearing a hood once

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,879
gave him some arrow poison leaf.

74
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,800
That day,

75
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,680
a man wearing a straw hat

76
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,560
knocked me out.

77
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,599
He forcibly fed me arrow poison leaves.

78
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,520
The getup the sorcerer described

79
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,039
must be what you're

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
wearing now.

81
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,879
There are many
who are dressed the same as me.

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,240
Wanwan.

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,400
Don't you

84
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,919
think you're being too assertive?

85
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,000
Assertive?

86
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,520
Fine.

87
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,680
What about the witchcraft incident?

88
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,199
Isn't that matter already settled?

89
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,439
Didn't Hongdou already commit suicide?

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,639
The writing on the Voodoo doll

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,100
was indeed written with a left hand,

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,039
but it wasn't Hongdou's left hand.

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
It was yours.

94
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,039
Your Highness.

95
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,879
Do you remember

96
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,000
the time when you

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,080
tried to correct
Princess Jingyue's left-handedness?

98
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,599
You made a lot of effort to do that.

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,319
But I've corrected that habit.

100
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,680
These years,

101
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,280
I've gotten used to using my right hand.

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,599
Wanwan.

103
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
From the way you're saying it,

104
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
you don't have any proof.

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,719
You want proof?

106
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a note Scholar Chunlai

107
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,279
wrote in blood before he died.

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,920
The letter

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,120
explains how you used Hongdou's child

110
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,199
to force her
into placing the Voodoo doll in my room.

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,399
Later,

112
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,560
you forced Hongdou to kill herself.

113
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,480
Chunlai

114
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,319
secretly brought Bao away,

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,399
but you ruthlessly hunted him down,

116
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,600
forcing him to write
a dying message with his blood

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
and leave Bao
at the entrance of our residence.

118
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,959
Lin Jingyue.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,439
You're truly ruthless.

120
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,240
Wanwan.

121
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

122
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
This is Hongdou and Chunlai's son,

123
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,920
Bao.

124
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,920
I found this child the other day

125
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,370
and gave him to Princess Dowager Yuan.

126
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,560
She asked me to care for him.

127
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,160
After Mother found the bloody note,

128
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,120
she was poisoned.

129
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Mother.

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
Your Highness.

131
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,399
You're awake.

132
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,519
I was worried sick.

133
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,439
That hurts.

134
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,519
Mother.

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Was she the one who harmed you?

136
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,879
If so,

137
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,959
blink your eyes.

138
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,480
Tang Wanwan.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,439
What kind of trickery did you use

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
to make Her Highness treat me this way?

141
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,879
It was...

142
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,800
It was...

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,879
Seeing that you're Xuanyi's mother,

144
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll keep you alive.

145
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,759
It was Lin Jingyue.

146
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,000
No, it wasn't.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
It was Lin Jingyue.

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,639
Lin Jingyue.

149
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Can you see these names?

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
Hongdou,

151
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,560
Chunlai,

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,079
Yin'er,

153
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,780
and all those citizens
who died from the arrow poison leaf

154
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,240
because they
couldn't get the Perescia plant in time.

155
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,920
Ghosts.

156
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,319
You're all dead.

157
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,720
You all deserved to die.

158
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,720
You deserved it.

159
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,720
You, too.

160
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,920
Follow me.

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,399
Search the entire city.

162
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,399
Yes.

163
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,959
With so many interconnected events,

164
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,260
it's not something Lin Jingyue
could have achieved alone.

165
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,839
There must be someone

166
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,600
guiding her from behind.

167
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,199
Since returning to this life,

168
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,800
I kept feeling

169
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
like many things

170
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,959
were connected

171
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,639
to our previous life.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Uh-hmm.

173
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,190
Master, you are indeed thoughtful
and farseeing.

174
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,120
Threatening Hongdou

175
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,170
and chasing after Chunlai

176
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,240
was done
under the guise of Princess Jingyue.

177
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,480
Chunlai's blood note

178
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,000
didn't mention anything
about Baiye Pavilion.

179
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,199
Always leave room for maneuvering

180
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,800
and take preventive measures.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,840
I also let Lv Qiao take Lin Jingyue away

182
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,360
to prevent Lin Jingyue
from making a slip of the tongue

183
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,480
and exposing us.

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Why don't we

185
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,519
just kill her?

186
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,279
Patience.

187
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
She's still of use to us.

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,399
Pavilion Master.

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,799
Master.

190
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,519
Did you orchestrate
what happened to Yin'er and my mother?

191
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,600
Master.

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,679
You told me

193
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,639
you were only after the throne

194
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,320
and wouldn't harm the innocent.

195
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,799
Qing'an.

196
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't be naive.

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,879
The path to becoming a ruler

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
is inevitably bloody.

199
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
A man

200
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,240
should have lofty ambitions,

201
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,080
ride on a fine horse,

202
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,639
and conquer the land.

203
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,480
Don't worry.

204
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,759
I know your bottom line.

205
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,200
I won't harm Wanwan anymore.

206
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,639
Once you become the Prince of Jiangling,

207
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,879
she'll still be

208
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,519
the Queen of Jiangling.

209
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Your Highness.

210
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,440
I mistook a stone for a precious jade

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
and failed to see
that you're a good person.

213
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,360
Lady Zhang.

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,519
Don't worry about it.

215
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
Tang Wanwan, you wench.

216
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,559
Give me back my daughter.

217
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,399
I want you dead.

218
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
