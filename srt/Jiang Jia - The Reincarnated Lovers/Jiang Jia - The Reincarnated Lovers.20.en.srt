=Episode 20=

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,990
The child is
in Princess Dowager Yuan's hands?

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,839
Didn't you say

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
you were going to get rid of the child?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
But on my way,

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,640
Hongdou's partner,

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Scholar Chunlai,

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,760
stole the child.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,560
I sent assassins to chase after them,

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,640
but I didn't

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,320
expect that before he died,

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,960
he sent the child
to Prince of Jiangling's residence.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,840
What do we do now?

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,240
If that old hag finds out

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,920
that I killed Hongdou,

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,320
who do we do when the truth
comes to light?

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,119
Don't panic, Princess.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,640
If we want

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,240
to ensure that nothing goes wrong,

21
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,280
there's only one way.

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,479
Take decisive action

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,880
without hesitation.

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,440
(Prince of Jiangling's Residence)

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,159
Princess Dowager Yuan!

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,239
Anyone out there?

27
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,400
Mother.

28
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't worry.

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,270
The best imperial physician

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,959
from Tian Capital has been summoned

31
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,480
to Jiangling Province.

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,120
Princess Dowager Yuan's illness

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,319
will be cured.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Lady Zhang.

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,200
What happened?

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
It was Queen of Jiangling.

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,920
When I entered the room,

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,400
I saw Her Highness
choking Princess Dowager Yuan

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,919
and trying to hurt her.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,000
No way.

41
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,719
I wanted to call for help,

42
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,400
but Her Highness

43
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,039
knocked me unconscious.

44
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,360
It wasn't me.

45
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,390
The time I've spent
by Princess Dowager Yuan's side

46
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,120
is probably longer than His Highness.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,900
I'm utterly grateful
to Princess Dowager Yuan,

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
so I will never betray her.

49
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,000
It was indeed Queen of Jiangling

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,759
who hurt Princess Dowager Yuan.

51
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,000
Lady Zhang.

52
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,120
Don't spill nonsense.

53
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,120
Why would I harm Mother?

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,680
Enough.

55
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,560
You may leave now.

56
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

57
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,590
Even though Princess Dowager Yuan
has been harsh to Wanwan

58
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,080
and even tried

59
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,960
to persuade Xuanyi
to divorce her,

60
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,719
I believe

61
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,960
that Wanwan would never do something

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,840
so outrageous to Princess Dowager Yuan.

63
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
Someone like her

64
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,360
is capable of anything.

65
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,919
Empress.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,879
What brings you here?

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,400
I noticed that you
didn't return to Tian Capital,

68
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,719
so I came over as well.

69
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,479
Jingyue has written a letter to me

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,759
describing everything
that happened here.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
How could you be so cruel

72
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,479
at such a young age?

73
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,159
How could you hurt your sister
and mother-in-law without mercy?

74
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,199
I didn't.

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,719
I didn't do it.

76
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,039
I wonder how your parents

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
managed to raise a daughter like you.

78
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,680
Do not speak ill of my parents.

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,039
Your eyes.

80
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,960
Mother, don't be afraid.

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,639
Wanwan

82
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
has heterochromia.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,680
Heterochromia?

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,120
Wanwan.

85
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,199
(Do you)

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
(not believe me too?)

87
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,600
(Wanwan.)

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
(Can I believe you?)

89
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,190
Your Highness.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,959
Lord Tang invited you to his residence
for a drink.

91
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
Here's the invitation.

92
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,480
Your Highness.

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Master Tang.

94
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,240
What's going on?

95
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,319
I invited Your Highness over today

96
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,720
to beg you

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,000
to spare Wanwan's life.

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
It hasn't been peaceful for us lately.

99
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,199
First, Tang Yin'er.

100
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,399
Then, Princess Dowager Yuan.

101
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,160
I raised Wanwan up,

102
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,720
so I can guarantee
that she's a kind child.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,480
If only I had known earlier,

104
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,759
I would have listened to her.

105
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,240
I should've resigned
and returned to Tian Capital

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
to live a peaceful life.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,350
Wanwan said if we didn't leave
this place,

108
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,040
our whole family
would suffer a calamity.

109
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,519
Now, everything is coming true.

110
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,319
Your Highness.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
His Highness
is at the Minister's residence.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,519
Master Tang sent him

113
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,560
an invitation

114
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,600
to have a drink.

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,880
(Xiao Beiyang)

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
His Highness is truly attentive to you.

117
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,680
These are the names he came up
for the little prince and princess.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
The princess will be Xiao Nansang,

119
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,839
while the prince will be Xiao Beiyang.

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Name them Xiao Nansang

121
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,600
and Xiao Beiyang.

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
Nansang.

123
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,000
Beiyang.

124
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,080
(Xiao Beiyang)

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
(Calamity?)

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,519
(When did Her Highness say that?)

127
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,399
(Was it)

128
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,439
(during Chongguang era's
Lantern Festival?)

129
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,040
(Yes.)

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,399
(I felt something strange about her
on that night when she returned.)

131
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,800
Xiao Xuanyi?

132
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,820
(The first request
is to revoke the decree)

133
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,639
(and cancel my engagement
to His Highness.)

134
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,160
Your Highness.

135
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,800
We have no feelings for each other.

136
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,279
Even if we marry,

137
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,000
it's unlikely

138
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,720
to end well.

139
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200

140
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
I ask for nothing else.

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
I just

142
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,959
(Escorting the bride)
want to marry Qing'an.

143
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,920
(Escorting the bride)

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,879
Are you going to mourn Xiao Qing'an
for the rest of your life?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,720
Yes.

146
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,680

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,690
You remember I was assassinated
during the Lantern Festival,

192
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,679
so you avoided the previous route.

193
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,919
You remember I am allergic
to osmanthus,

194
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,120
but you pretended not to know.

195
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,039
Now, I finally understand

196
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,639
why you hated me so much

197
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
when we first met.

198
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,080
I understand why you suggested
that your father resign from office.

199
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,919
I also understand

200
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,080
why you publicly refused our marriage

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,639
and insisted on marrying Qing'an.

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,919
Whatever happened in the past life

203
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,639
causes consequences in this life.

204
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,399
You're aware

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
of what you did before, Your Highness.

206
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,039
When Lord Tang colluded with Xiliang,

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,600
the evidence was conclusive.

208
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,879
I...

209
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,320
I know.

210
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,960
You had no choice

211
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,960
but to follow orders.

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,559
It's the same now.

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,759
Yin'er's death

214
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,679
and Mother's condition

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,559
is fully supported by evidence,

216
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,519
so I have no room to defend myself.

217
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,519
Wanwan.

218
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,440
Don't touch me.

219
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,440
Wanwan.

220
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
Don't touch me.

221
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,279
Wanwan.

222
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,399
