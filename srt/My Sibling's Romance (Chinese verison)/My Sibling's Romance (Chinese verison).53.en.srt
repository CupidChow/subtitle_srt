1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,400
Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Welcome, boss.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It feels like we'll have some wild wine.

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. My scalp will breathe.

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a chance to get a surprise reward.

10
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,360
Chen'er.

11
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
What are you doing?

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm calling you.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,200
Look at me.

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
Bobo misses me.

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,720
Yinbo.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
Why are you laughing?

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm laughing at you for Hua.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
Laughing at me for finding Hua?

19
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,640
So what?

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
You miss her?

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,560
It's none of your business.

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,680
I'll take a photo of your face.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,800
Send it to Lo Ling Kai.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, keep smiling.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Smile.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Smile crooked.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm speechless.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,120
I thought Bobo only recorded me.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
He recorded it everywhere.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
It's over, right?

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,840
Since you said so,

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
I'll show Tata

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
to Tata.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,120
Am I too much?

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,600
That's too much.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
Let me see which one.

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Let me see.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,480
You fell asleep in the car when you came back yesterday.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Let me see.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
I won't move.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,960
Your hands are like this.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
So sweet.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
I'll take it.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
He's so bad.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
Yuan Bo.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
Hurry up. Did you shoot him?

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
She didn't.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,920
No.

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
She said when I fell asleep,

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
She said you would fall asleep.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
I said I won't sleep.

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm impressed.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,200
Su Zihao.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,640
What's wrong?

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
Is this for me?

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,240
It's nice.

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
You're the best person in my life.

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Fat beef (rice).

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Get some

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,040
Get a bowl.

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you want beef rice?

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
We'll share it together.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,000
Tom.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Thank you.

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,280
Eel rice

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
Why don't you eat eels

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,720
No

69
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
I said I wanted to eat eels yesterday

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
I want eel rice

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,120
You want eel rice

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,040
It's so sudden

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,120
I just mentioned it on the bus

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
I said I wanted eel rice

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,839
There was a box of eel rice this morning

76
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,600
I feel very happy

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
A little happy.

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,320
I'll dig half for you.

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,600
For me?

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
You're so kind.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,640
It's from Susu.

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Sit down.

83
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,920
Why are you standing?

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
You want to sit here, right?

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You want to face Susu, right?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,760
Then face to face with Susu.

88
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Okay.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
I'll go find a tower.

90
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,600
Xiaoling, why are you here?

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,520
I don't want to be a third wheel there.

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,920
You're not here.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Fight.

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm white.

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
I saw you two competing there.

96
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,680
Competed. Like this.

97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,640
Got it.

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
To members of the house.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,920
(Confession is coming.)

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,520
We've prepared

101
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,800
for boys and girls.

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
Please discuss

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
and make your choice.

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,040
A romantic dinner.

105
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
B is for barbecue.

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,040
You girls choose.

107
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,400
The rest of us boys will do.

108
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,159
Then you guys go to the bath.

109
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,920
Yes, girls can't.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,159
Guolifang.

111
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,400
I can't make it anyway.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,960
Okay, the boy will be ruined.

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Have some water.

114
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,440
Susu.

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
Weak.

116
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's go.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Let's go somewhere warm.

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
Tom.

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,159
Aren't you going to ruin it tonight?

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
You...

121
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
check the map for me.

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,080
And

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,960
ask him for me.

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,560
But don't tell my sister.

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,200
Just ask him.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,360
how you feel with me.

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Or how do you feel now?

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,720
You can ask him from his perspective.

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
It's juice.

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,320
Last night we talked about

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
I can feel

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
he might be interested in me.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,280
But

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,040
I think I did something

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
to me.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,120
or feedback,

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,000
I think I got it.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,240
But I think some problems

139
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
For example,

140
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,560
or something else.

141
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
When we were shopping yesterday,

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,560
I bought some crispy meat.

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,520
The picture said

144
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,120
Then Xin said,

145
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
I thought you were going to say it.

146
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,440
Xiaoling, I hope

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,080
you like me like you like crispy meat.

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,120
Then the map said

149
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,760
No.

150
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,159
Then the picture starts to change the subject.

151
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Fragrant juice wine.

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Xiao Ling, I don't know

153
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
what Xiao Ling thinks about juice.

154
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Xiao Ling, just help me find out.

155
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,040
Just help me.

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
No matter what you think,

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,560
no matter what Xiao Ling thinks,

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,640
I can accept whatever he thinks.

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
Xiao Ling, I don't know what he thinks.

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm confused about Xiaoling's juice wine.

161
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm more confused.

162
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll ask for you.

163
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,320
But...

164
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Relax.

165
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Juice wine.

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,840
Because I never felt

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,360
he has such passionate feelings for you.

168
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,840
When I get along with Susu,

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm worried about what I do.

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,880
Juice wine.

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,800
It'll make her unhappy.

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
It will make her unhappy.

173
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,240
It will make her unhappy.

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
That's it.

175
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,240
But when he was with you,

176
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,680
I didn't feel it.

177
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,040
It's mixed juice.

178
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,840
He didn't get to

179
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,160
the perspective of soup and juice.

180
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,760
It's about soup-flavoured juice wine.

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,400
Xiaoling's juice wine, so I...

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,960
Xiaoling's feeling of juice wine is a little sad.

183
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,799
Fragrant juice wine.

184
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
Tonight,

185
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
we girls have a party together.

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll ask Hua

187
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,480
What does she think about this?

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,159
Because I think

189
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,320
she is the sister of the picture.

190
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,040
I think she knows him better.

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,520
I was wondering if

192
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
Whether Xiaoling doesn't know

193
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,480
or she has no experience.

194
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,400
Xiaoling, I want to know what Hua said.

195
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,160
I really need to see the problem clearly.

196
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,600
And...

197
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,760
You might have to make a decision

198
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,320
you may need to make a decision.

199
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Yes.

200
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
But I think

201
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,640
during the process,

202
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
don't feel too stressed.

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
We just...

204
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Even if I know what he really thinks,

205
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,680
maybe

206
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,400
Even if Xiao Ling is not that interested in me,

207
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
if I still admire him,

208
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
Xiao Ling wants to get close to him,

209
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,400
If I get close to him,

210
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,960
I'll still text him how I feel.

211
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,480
Juice wine.

212
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,880
Juice wine.
Yes.

213
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
In many times,

214
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Fatty said

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
I think it's useful.

216
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't listen to him.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
and see what he can do.

218
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
Soup. And you can ask around tonight.

219
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I'll ask around.

220
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,160
It's a lie if it's different.

221
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,640
It's okay. If it's different,

222
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
I can come up with a conclusion.

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,400
Well,

224
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe he's not that interested in me.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,040
I know this result.

226
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,520
I can accept it.

227
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,920
Yes.

228
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
Sit here.

229
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,920
Xiao Ling, your sister is not sad anymore.

230
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
It's okay.

231
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
I'll let you lean on it for a while.

232
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
People don't rely on it.

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Is this Su's privilege?

234
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
I didn't say it.

235
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
She's very consuming.

236
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,240
I can feel it.

237
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,040
She said that

238
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,080
she might be observing.

239
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,120
But I think she's moved.

240
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't care

241
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
every behavior of the map.

242
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,400
care about this person.

243
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,120
and a serious attitude.

244
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I hope

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
have a deeper relationship.

246
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
So I hope the map can give me

247
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,520
a more clear answer

248
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,240
or the most accurate answer.

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Let's go.

250
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,600
Mimi.

251
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
Let's go.

252
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,640
We're different from them, right?

253
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
No.

254
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll sit here.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,440
OK.

256
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,400
Mr. Tu

257
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,960
Mr. Tu

258
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,400
A heart-warming game.

259
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,560
is about sincerity.

260
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm the most sincere in the car.

261
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
Where do you put me?

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
If I'm not sincere,

263
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
no one is sincere in the world.

264
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,480
Let's swim.

265
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,680
Soak this.

266
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,800
The thing is, can this pool make five people?

267
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Yes.

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
This is nice.

269
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,520
So warm.

270
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,160
There's a changing room here.

271
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Who goes in first?

272
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,080
I'll change it.

273
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay, you change first.

274
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Bye.

275
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm curious.

276
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
what happened over there.

277
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,840
They're playing with water happily.

278
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
They're playing with water and eating barbecue.

279
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,080
Are the five boys really good at playing water?

280
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
I want to ask this picture.

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,240
The picture and Fatty should be...

282
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
must be the happiest one.

283
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't do this.

284
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Fatty's water will be gone after entering the pool.

285
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
You're so bad.

286
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
You're really my sister.

287
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
The pool of drought.

288
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm here.

289
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Are you cold?

290
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,280
You have to go there.

291
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
No, I have to go down.

292
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
You two need to sit here.

293
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,720
and have a good chat.

294
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
So comfortable.

295
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,920
You can't put it down, right?

296
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes.

297
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,960
It is.

298
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,760
This is for breakfast.

299
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you have anything

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
to ask for your brothers?

301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
Yes.

302
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,240
Let me do it

303
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
She's very exhausted.

304
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
That's why she's in pain.

305
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
She came to me.

306
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,400
She asked me to ask around for her.

307
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,880
the observation map.

308
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,680
The map.

309
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,840
So I want to ask first.

310
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
The soup first.

311
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
The first question.

312
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Did you send a message

313
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
to the girls in the house.

314
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,480
Three.

315
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
First, Esther.

316
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,360
And on the day of the tower,

317
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,880
And Xiao Ling

318
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
Does Xiaoling know

319
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
she's the second choice for your date?

320
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,880
The one in the Mirror Room?

321
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,640
That's what I thought that day.

322
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,800
Because after a day,

323
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
I have more contact with Tata after all.

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,360
Because I was with her that day.

325
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,120
with her that day.

326
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
Then at night,

327
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
at night,

328
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I had more contact with Xiaoling.

329
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
So I thought

330
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
I met these two people.

331
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm asking about Xiaoling.

332
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,040
She doesn't know, right?

333
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,840
Do you think you're sincere to Xiaoling?

334
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
So sharp.

335
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
I think I'm very sincere.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
From

337
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
the first day

338
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,400
texted each other on the first day.

339
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
we started to contact.

340
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,000
And we played together.

341
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
and travel later.

342
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,280
are very sincere.

343
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,520
sincere.

344
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,080
Yes.

345
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,840
He said he was very sincere to Xiaoling.

346
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,760
What I can understand is

347
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,360
he failed during the competition.

348
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,080
He immediately

349
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,400
completely into Xiaoling.

350
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,760
If his sincerity is like this,

351
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,240
I think it might be hard.

352
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
When he asked me if I was sincere,

353
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,640
I was a little angry.

354
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,720
But I didn't express it.

355
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,520
I feel

356
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,240
I feel very sad.

357
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,320
Because I think my sincerity

358
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,840
is completely in your eyes.

359
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,680
Maybe there are some doubts

360
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
and some thoughts.

361
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
in front of you.

362
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,440
I feel

363
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,280
hesitating.

364
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,480
But my heart must be sincere.

365
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
What do you think

366
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,160
your sincerity?

367
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
I think my sincere behavior

368
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,960
shows

369
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,800
I didn't say

370
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,840
to get to know others while knowing her.

371
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,920
At first, I went with Xinxin.

372
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
The next day, when Tata came,

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,040
I was forced to

374
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,440
We had to team up.

375
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,480
Because I don't have the right to choose others.

376
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
to be with her.

377
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,680
And in the end,

378
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,760
I didn't know Tata or anyone.

379
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
I've been

380
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,400
with Xiaoling.

381
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,760
During the two days of the trip,

382
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,240
how did Xiaoling feel?

383
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,720
sometimes she acts proactively.

384
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
But you seem to avoid it.

385
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
Sometimes, when she

386
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
with you,

387
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,560
you may change the topic.

388
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,200
or

389
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
it's just a relationship issue.

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
with your relationship.

391
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
It will change the subject.

392
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Did she tell you

393
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,360
what she talked about?

394
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,320
No.

395
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,680
But

396
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,360
she was very sad.

397
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
Really?

398
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
But I don't remember anything about me.

399
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
Because

400
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
playing.

401
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,760
I remember that day we...

402
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,160
Recall it carefully.

403
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,920
Let me recall.

404
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,680
There must be evidence

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,400
to question you.

406
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,560
They must have their reasons.

407
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,040
Yes.

408
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
Think about it. Did you ignore

409
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
when others were talking to you,

410
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
you went to play.

411
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,840
I think

412
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,280
we both

413
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,440
took the initiative.

414
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
Maybe in Xiao Ling's eyes,

415
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,880
she might be

416
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
some initiative

417
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,520
to test me.

418
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,119
Maybe I take this kind of test

419
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,560
some of our daily communication

420
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,599
are confused.

421
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,920
Not very clear.

422
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
and misunderstood her.

423
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,119
She might think I rejected her.

424
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,680
to reject her.

425
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Last question.

426
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,079
Okay.

427
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,240
When I read your letter,

428
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,119
your letter was full of your feelings.

429
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
We didn't talk much about Xiaoling.

430
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,080
Let me see yours.

431
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
The picture is full of

432
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,800
more about your feelings.

433
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,560
I didn't write it on you.

434
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,040
That day,

435
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,080
When I knew I was going to write this letter,

436
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,960
I started writing right away.

437
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
Because at that time,

438
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,320
she was the first one to comfort me.

439
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,200
except my sister.

440
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,440
who came to comfort me.

441
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
I was really touched that day.

442
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
So I might write more.

443
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
Why did I

444
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
that day?

445
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,320
and sad.

446
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,240
She came to comfort me. I was very touched.

447
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,640
and added

448
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
some feelings

449
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,320
OK. OK.

450
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,800
OK.

451
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,880
As your brother,

452
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
I want to tell you

453
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,240
before you act,

454
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,040
Who are you?

455
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,080
Xiao Ling

456
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,800
is comfortable with you.

457
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
She knows how to take care of people.

458
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,320
Or

459
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
you really have feelings for her?

460
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,760
I also advised him to look at his true self.

461
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,880
What was he thinking?

462
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,920
I don't want you

463
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,360
get hurt in this relationship.

464
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,560
sad and unhappy.

465
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,920
This question is just a question for you.

466
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,360
But you really need to think about it.

467
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,080
Yes, I know.

468
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,640
He asked this question.

469
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
Actually, I'm thinking about

470
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,600
I feel very comfortable

471
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
with Xiaoling.

472
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
But I'm not sure

473
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
Is it the feeling

474
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,520
or the feeling of love?

475
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,600
What about the feelings in your heart?

476
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,440
This is what I can't tell right now.

477
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,840
You still don't know

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,920
between friends and love?

479
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
Will you confess if I let you choose?

480
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,720
That's why

481
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,160
hesitating.

482
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Confused and hesitant.

483
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,680
Because I think

484
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
confession is

485
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,160
a grand thing.

486
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,800
I haven't figured out

487
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,920
whether you're going to confess your love.

488
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,400
I think my biggest feeling tonight

489
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
is quite contradictory.

490
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,320
They don't know

491
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,880
why I'm so hesitant now.

492
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,080
What kind of concerns or thoughts would I have?

493
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,320
So in others' eyes,

494
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,600
I will be

495
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,760
who doesn't take the initiative

496
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,840
No communication.

497
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
or express.

498
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,000
including the questions he asked me.

499
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,080
which made me very sad.

500
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,800
Actually, I don't mean much to the map.

501
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,080
It's just that Xiaoling is upset.

502
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,680
I think Tu should go.

503
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,560
Be it positive

504
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,360
or negative,

505
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,680
he needs to respond.

506
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,440
And it's true that

507
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,280
You only have two days left.

508
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,400
You still don't know

509
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
how you feel.

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,040
Maybe he's slow to warm up.

511
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,040
Hua told you

512
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,240
when you were in the siblings' house,

513
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,840
I told you

514
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,400
my impression.

515
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,840
I can only say

516
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,760
I feel comfortable with him.

517
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,880
I think you are a very considerate

518
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,520
And

519
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,600
the most memorable thing about me is

520
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,000
the first time you went out,

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
you've been taking photos for her.

522
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,120
and record it.

523
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Before that,

524
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,840
Yes, she told me

525
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,720
someone who wasn't recorded.

526
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,880
Yes, she told me.

527
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,320
So we went to Tianjin

528
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
and the beach.

529
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,840
I've been taking photos for her.

530
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,520
I think she's still very happy.

531
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,240
Since you've asked this question,

532
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,560
Come on.

533
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,200
Let me ask you.

534
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,600
Do you think

535
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,080
how do you feel

536
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,920
how do you feel about her?

537
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
Tae-seo.

538
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
I thought

539
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Hana is so easy-going.

540
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,800
We should be able to talk a lot.

541
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,560
But seriously,

542
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,080
I was quite nervous on my first date.

543
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,960
At that time,

544
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,920
I was agitated and anxious.

545
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm really agitated and anxious.

546
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
This is real.

547
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,160
It's real.

548
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,760
But in the ancient city,

549
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,320
we went to the ancient city together

550
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,080
and take photos together.

551
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,960
Slowly

552
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,560
No matter it's an ancient city,

553
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,120
we'll go to Tianjin

554
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,120
and go to the Ferris wheel.

555
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,360
Many things happened anyway.

556
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,800
When I was with her,

557
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,360
with her.

558
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,400
My feelings for her

559
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,920
for her.

560
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,240
Now I'm...

561
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
As her brother, you should feel it.

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Do you remember what I gave her

563
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
I gave her?

564
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Actually that score

565
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,600
was what I thought.

566
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
I got 7 to 8.

567
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,840
Because

568
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,880
In fact, dating depends on the feeling.

569
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
I feel that I will be with her.

570
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
I think Hua and I

571
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,400
are getting better.

572
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
I have a question.

573
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,640
Go ahead.

574
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,760
what do you think about Hua?

575
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,040
After

576
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,480
with her,

577
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,560
she wrote the letter to me.

578
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,320
about this.

579
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes, I was quite disappointed.

580
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,000
But Hua came to me and told me.

581
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,840
about this.

582
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Before I came here,

583
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,360
she met Fatty

584
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
may have some misunderstandings with you.

585
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,760
Actually, I don't quite understand

586
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,600
I don't quite understand.

587
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,120
Because the next day,

588
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
I did go on a date with Hua.

589
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,400
The beans we put together.

590
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Yes, because I refused.

591
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,760
Is that so?

592
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,760
So if you don't refuse,

593
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
she's going on a date with you, right?

594
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,360
Yes.

595
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
She's on a date with you two.

596
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Both of you.

597
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,920
It's like this.

598
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,440
Yes.

599
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,800
Fatty told me

600
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,240
he didn't write it to Hua.

601
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,600
I was quite shocked.

602
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,120
But after a few days of contact,

603
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,200
she may have some misunderstanding with Fatty.

604
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
She needs to write a letter to resolve the misunderstanding.

605
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
and sort it out.

606
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,200
Actually, I thought

607
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,160
I've figured it out.

608
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,520
The feeling you can accept is...

609
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,800
My first impression of you

610
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,200
my first impression was

611
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,280
I know what you mean.

612
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,360
until the temperature slowly rises.

613
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,960
Can you accept this?

614
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,800
I can accept it.

615
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,120
That's why

616
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
for such a long time before I fall in love.

617
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,480
So what you did

618
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,600
what you did

619
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,000
and activeness.

620
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,360
Do you think

621
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,240
a sense of crisis?

622
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,160
Do you feel pressured?

623
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,240
Let me be honest, I really don't.

624
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,560
Why?

625
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Because

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
Hua has been giving me a signal.

627
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,040
That is,

628
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,240
she sent me every text message.

629
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,200
She also sent me her date after that.

630
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,880
Let me put it this way.

631
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
When we went on a trip,

632
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,720
if I took the initiative,

633
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,120
Hua will definitely sit with me.

634
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,640
Okay.

635
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
Wonderful.

636
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,760
No, we have a chat party, right?

637
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,520
I think you can say whatever you want.

638
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
To be honest,

639
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,320
my relationship with Tae-seo

640
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
is a competition.

641
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,400
But when we were together,

642
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,320
I didn't feel

643
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,240
to me.

644
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,600
won't affect us.

645
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
between us.

646
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,720
I think so too.

647
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,200
His reaction

648
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
to me.

649
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
And I feel comfortable

650
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,040
I feel good.

651
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,080
It's your turn.

652
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,120
It's your turn.

653
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
Do you think

654
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,680
fall in love at first sight?

655
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,600
or love at first sight?

656
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,240
I fell in love at first sight.

657
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
Why?

658
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,560
When I saw a girl,

659
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,720
at first sight.

660
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,880
I just want to get close to her.

661
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,640
approach her.

662
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,880
Do you mean the look?

663
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,440
Or...

664
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,680
at first sight?

665
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,360
Kind of shallow.

666
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,120
Definitely.

667
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,400
looks.

668
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,480
People are attracted to beautiful things.

669
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,600
I agree.

670
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,640
It makes sense.

671
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,480
May I ask

672
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,760
if the three views don't match, can we date?

673
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,440
I think we're quite compatible for now.

674
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,960
Can we...

675
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,280
Can we talk if we don't get along?

676
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,520
I'm not sure.

677
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Money, career, and family.

678
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,120
Which one would you choose?

679
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
Between one or in the order,

680
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,320
In order.

681
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,400
My family should be number one.

682
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,040
Love and career.

683
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,800
If I'm with someone

684
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,760
for some time,

685
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,920
the order of love may go up.

686
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,840
But for now, career is second.

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Love comes first, money comes first.

688
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,720
They were together.

689
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,080
Both of them don't like communicating and then cold war.

690
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
Including these questions.

691
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,800
Can you really go against your nature

692
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,760
instead of

693
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,600
to talk about this.

694
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,240
I think it's not difficult

695
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,760
to communicate with others.

696
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,440
I thought

697
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
if they didn't want to communicate.

698
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
That's one thing.

699
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,000
Second, isn't it cheap to do this alone?

700
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
This is the second point.

701
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,080
And third, is it worth

702
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,720
I think communication

703
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
is not a problem.

704
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,560
For you,

705
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
it's not difficult

706
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
is not a difficult thing.

707
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
But when we communicate

708
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,920
and communicate,

709
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,560
can express

710
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,080
the emotions my sister needs

711
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,520
and the emotional value she needs.

712
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
I think

713
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
I can't exactly catch

714
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
what your sister

715
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,680
What makes Susu unhappy

716
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,320
or something.

717
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,320
I don't know her well enough.

718
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,720
To be honest,

719
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,760
is that

720
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,080
in life.

721
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,600
But I think I can

722
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,360
my unhappiness

723
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,840
or happy,

724
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,640
to her.

725
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,920
Because she's a straightforward person.

726
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,560
Maybe I am

727
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,160
afraid of communication.

728
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,720
I may walk out of my comfort zone

729
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
step out of my comfort zone

730
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,040
and break the protective layer I set for myself.

731
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm going to find Susu.

732
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
I'll talk to her.

733
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,840
and contact her.

734
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
and fight for my love.

735
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,800
As the elder brother of Tata,

736
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,200
For example.

737
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,760
If she succeeds,

738
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,200
isn't she going to Japan?

739
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
You're going back to study.

740
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
And then?

741
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,120
Either I'm tired

742
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,840
or her schedule can be stable

743
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,120
and set the time.

744
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,160
No.

745
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
There's no way to solve it.

746
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,800
Because this idea

747
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm annoyed every night.

748
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,760
I did a lot of homework.

749
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,920
including my visa.

750
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,520
I can't get a visa.

751
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Then

752
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
Two or three months

753
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
It's all in the past.

754
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,840
There must be a way before the mountain.

755
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,280
When a boat reaches the bridge, it will go straight.

756
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,760
What will you do

757
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,120
what would you do?

758
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,360
Make her happy.

759
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I can't.

760
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,400
Good job.

761
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,600
Good.

762
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,880
Good coaxing.

763
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,000
I think it's good.

764
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,960
So confident.

765
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,600
Because I'm not the kind of person who makes sense.

766
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
I'll coax someone first

767
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
before reasoning.

768
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,960
Make it up before you reason.

769
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,040
If you can't, you're unreasonable.

770
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,920
I'll fly over if there's no other way.

771
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,600
Yes.

772
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
I like that.

773
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
It's really boring

774
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,080
is really boring.

775
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,640
First,

776
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,680
you can only read cold words.

777
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,320
You can't feel each other's emotions.

778
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,800
Second,

779
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,360
you can't catch any details.

780
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,840
Yes.

781
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,760
Words

782
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
and words

783
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,840
It's really different

784
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,640
Different.

785
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,280
So what you think

786
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,080
is different

787
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,640
is different.

788
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,920
Let's open the blind box, okay?

789
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,880
I'll draw one first.

790
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,040
What a scary question.

791
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,160
What is it?

792
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,000
The first question.

793
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,120
How many people have you sent messages to?

794
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,760
I sent to three people.

795
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,040
Which three?

796
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Hua. Xiao Ling.

797
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,640
Tata is here for the first day.

798
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,720
I sent a welcome message.

799
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,840
How did you define your feelings?

800
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
I think

801
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,000
to me.

802
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,040
To express my feelings?

803
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,120
You welcomed her on your first day.

804
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,280
Send him a welcome message.

805
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,600
Yes, a friend is here.

806
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,840
Isn't this a gift?

807
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,120
A smile.

808
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
Comforting him is also her intention.

809
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,280
The beginning and the later are different.

810
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,120
When you know how he feels,

811
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
the meaning of this message has changed.

812
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Okay, I got it.

813
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
And when I felt

814
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,600
When did I feel the sense of crisis?

815
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,840
Tae-seo is a good person.

816
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
So I didn't feel any sense of crisis.

817
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,600
In the last two days,

818
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,640
Will I assist my brothers?

819
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,920
That won't happen.

820
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,480
But if my brother has a love line,

821
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,840
I might still...

822
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll do it.

823
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
I sent some messages to some people.

824
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,160
I just said three people.

825
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,560
At first, Esther.

826
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,520
The tower at the back is that day.

827
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
And then Xiaoling.

828
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
And how did I define the message of love?

829
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,280
It is

830
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,640
After you met that person,

831
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,400
do you think

832
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
you want to know more about her

833
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,120
to express

834
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,360
to her,

835
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,920
you can text her with your feelings.

836
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,680
When did I feel the sense of crisis?

837
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,400
After we were in the romantic house,

838
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,720
Because my sister never

839
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
had such a big conflict with me.

840
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,160
This must be the crisis of your relationship.

841
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
No, I just felt a sense of crisis.

842
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
At that moment, I thought

843
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,720
between my brother and me.

844
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,080
Does he really care about Xiaoling?

845
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
When I chatted with Tu,

846
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm confused.

847
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,560
I...

848
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,800
I don't know what he's thinking.

849
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,000
In the last two days,

850
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,120
will I still assist my brothers?

851
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,800
I don't need help.

852
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
It depends on her.

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,120
How many people did she send messages to?

854
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,160
I sent it to one person.

855
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,080
Susu.

856
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,040
How do I define (feelings) text?

857
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,920
The message I define is

858
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,720
I want to know more about the person I like.

859
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,880
In the cabin,

860
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,080
When did I feel the sense of crisis?

861
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,480
When Tae-seo came,

862
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,800
Really?

863
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,760
That one.

864
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,120
That day,

865
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
because Susu sent you her message.

866
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,960
I was quite upset that night.

867
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,240
I thought maybe

868
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
my feelings were separated.

869
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
In the last two days,

870
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Will I assist my brothers?

871
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
I won't.

872
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,560
The first question.

873
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
I sent three.

874
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,800
Which three?

875
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,600
Xinxin wanted to contact her at first.

876
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,680
The second one is Xiaoling.

877
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,400
I sent it to her on Cupid's date.

878
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,080
I made myself clear.

879
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,240
I said we should be friends.

880
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,960
Then Tata

881
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,280
Then I kept sending messages to her.

882
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
That's all?

883
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,000
When did you feel

884
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,360
When did you feel the sense of crisis?

885
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,760
A sense of crisis?

886
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,080
I feel like

887
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,520
every day.

888
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
Because in fact,

889
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,320
the sense of crisis is not given by others.

890
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,120
but myself.

891
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,480
I think too much things that have never happened

892
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,520
or something like that.

893
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,880
I would imagine it.

894
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,280
What if something happens?

895
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,320
Are you still helping your brother in the last two days?

896
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,560
If she needs me or...

897
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Tom.

898
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,960
I need to help him with the soup.

899
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,760
to help him.

900
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,040
to help him deliver something.

901
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
I would do that.

902
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,560
If neither of them needs me,

903
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,120
I won't do it.

904
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,760
I quit.

905
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,520
How many people did you send messages to?

906
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,680
Me too.

907
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,040
The first one to send (feeling) message is Susu.

908
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,440
Because when the four of us had dinner,

909
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,320
everyone asked me who my first impression was the best.

910
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,520
The second message was sent to Xinxin.

911
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,800
Yes, I sent it to Xinxin.

912
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,080
Because that day,

913
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,960
after the ice exercise,

914
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,800
I had a date with Susu.

915
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,760
I thought it might be more like Susu.

916
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,560
I think it's more suitable to be friends.

917
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,040
Then I want to say

918
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,960
to contact other girls.

919
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
After I went back to the house that day,

920
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,440
I might

921
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,800
with Xinxin.

922
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,000
After that, Hua

923
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
I sent them to Flower.

924
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,920
So the message

925
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,440
I think

926
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,360
every day.

927
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,240
to each other.

928
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,200
When you feel

929
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,080
when did you feel the sense of crisis?

930
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,040
When Hua wrote the letter to Fatty,

931
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,920
I did.

932
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,360
Yes, I did.

933
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,080
At that moment.

934
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,520
In the last two days,

935
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
will you still assist your brothers?

936
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,120
I don't have any siblings.

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,280
Help Tata and Harry.

938
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,720
I don't think it's necessary.

939
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,080
They are always together.

940
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,080
Next.

941
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
Open it.

942
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,920
Open it.

943
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,960
At this stage,

944
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,920
your siblings and interest

945
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,080
in your heart.

946
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,560
This is the hardest question.

947
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,920
This is sharp.

948
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
I'll go first.

949
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,680
I'll make it simple.

950
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,360
To be honest,

951
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,280
even if my sister comes,

952
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,240
I would say it without hesitation.

953
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,200
the person I like is 100%.

954
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,560
100.

955
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,160
Really?

956
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm kind of lovesick.

957
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,920
Tata is more in my heart.

958
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Occupy.

959
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,400
How much?

960
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,440
10,000 percent.

961
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,080
OK.

962
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,639
Because I'm really

963
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,600
a very romantic person.

964
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,159
In fact, I've been dealing with my crush.

965
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,800
It's 50 and 50.

966
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
My proportion

967
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
is actually 60.

968
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,280
The crush is 40.

969
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,320
Actually, we've only been here for a dozen days.

970
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,159
At this stage,

971
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,679
you can't compare to your brother.

972
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,400
But I want to give him

973
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,800
the happiest time.

974
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,159
when

975
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,239
when my brother doesn't need me,

976
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,040
when my brother doesn't need me.

977
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,280
I think I should be like the soup.

978
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,239
It's 64.

979
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,600
When I cried,

980
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,080
It made me feel

981
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,800
my brothers are very important to me.

982
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,960
Pack up.

983
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,080
Let's go barbecue.

984
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,400
Barbecue?

985
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Then ask the next two questions.

986
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Let's go barbecue.

987
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,320
Okay.

988
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
So pretty.

989
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,040
Back to the beginning.

990
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
On the first day I came here,

991
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,840
I had a date with every boy here.

992
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,040
Really?

993
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,280
You've been here before?

994
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,000
Yes.

995
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,120
Let's play a mix game.

996
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,840
Finally, mix a fruit cube in.

997
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,680
OK.

998
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,120
What?

999
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,240
You're just trying to

1000
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,880
It tastes good no matter how you mix it.

1001
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
Start to work

1002
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,600
Come on, cheers.

1003
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,520
I'll add one and a half.

1004
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,840
Why don't you choose a Guoli?

1005
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,440
Okay.

1006
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,480
Here, cover her eyes.

1007
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
I'll hold your hand.

1008
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,000
This is the first one.

1009
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
Two, three, four.

1010
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,600
You choose.

1011
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,520
Three.

1012
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,840
White grapes.

1013
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,120
His face is full.

1014
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Let's take a photo.

1015
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,920
I can't wait.

1016
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
Hurry up.

1017
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Right away.

1018
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
The color is so beautiful.

1019
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,400
Try it.

1020
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,440
Cheers.

1021
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,080
Here.

1022
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,200
Isn't it good?

1023
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,440
Yes.

1024
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,200
It's really good.

1025
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,400
Can we make a few more cups later?

1026
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,920
Eat as much as you want.

1027
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,320
Tata, I had this kind of snack on my date.

1028
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,120
The last time Harry came in...

1029
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm so full.

1030
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,480
He came in like this.

1031
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,400
I heard.

1032
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,040
He said he didn't prepare anything

1033
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
without any burden.

1034
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
He kept touching his belly there.

1035
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,080
I thought

1036
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
he would give me some hints to chat.

1037
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,040
They take turns.

1038
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,680
Don't you know who goes first?

1039
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,040
They all said they went to the toilet.

1040
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,360
And everyone

1041
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
has different time with me.

1042
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,120
Because this is my decision.

1043
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,840
You decide this person for five minutes.

1044
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,160
He'll talk for ten minutes.

1045
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,560
We can renew it at the time.

1046
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,040
or end it.

1047
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,200
Have you renewed it?

1048
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,280
Yes, Harry.

1049
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,880
We really hit it off on the first day.

1050
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
Because he was relaxed.

1051
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Because his stomach is too full.

1052
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,640
He's so relaxed.

1053
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,120
Super loose.

1054
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,000
The boys in the small house are all young.

1055
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,440
Yes.

1056
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,480
In the small house,

1057
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,960
in the small house.

1058
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,880
Harry is quite active.

1059
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,760
Harry is so proactive.

1060
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,520
He's really proactive.

1061
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,760
But he ignored me when I took the initiative.

1062
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,720
He rejected me three times.

1063
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,280
Brave enough to charge

1064
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,200
Rota.

1065
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,440
So...

1066
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Why did it start?

1067
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,480
She's so scary.

1068
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,440
So...

1069
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,000
Go ahead.

1070
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,120
It's convenient for you to be across the street.

1071
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,480
Your burning eyes.

1072
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
Hot eyes.

1073
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,680
See if Hua is lying.

1074
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,640
I'm curious.

1075
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Did Tu tell you

1076
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,200
his impression of me?

1077
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,040
or something.

1078
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
From the beginning,

1079
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,560
I should pay attention to his emotions

1080
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
more emotions.

1081
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,080
But at the beginning,

1082
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,640
I thought

1083
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,320
when he gets along with Xinxin more,

1084
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,360
I would ask him more.

1085
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,480
After something happened to me,

1086
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,680
I didn't pay much attention.

1087
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,240
But I...

1088
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
I think he is very comfortable

1089
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,800
with you.

1090
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,560
But I...

1091
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,080
I don't think

1092
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,920
to take the initiative.

1093
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,880
So I was thinking

1094
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,840
he didn't take the initiative to you.

1095
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,120
I thought I took the initiative.

1096
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,680
And

1097
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,120
from my perspective,

1098
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,440
I think you didn't take the initiative.

1099
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,880
But I think he takes the initiative to you.

1100
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,200
Tell me.

1101
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,880
If you don't take the initiative,

1102
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,560
What do you mean?

1103
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,800
Hurry, I need to compare.

1104
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,160
Because I still remember

1105
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,600
the photographer got first place.

1106
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
He can switch with a man.

1107
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,160
On the next day,

1108
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,280
I was happy to see him.

1109
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,600
But he said

1110
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I shouldn't have

1111
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,520
I wouldn't want it.

1112
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,880
To win,

1113
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,160
to have this privilege?

1114
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,760
right?

1115
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,320
No.

1116
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,800
If I knew it was a reward like this,

1117
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't want to win.

1118
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,160
He doesn't want to be with me. I know.

1119
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,720
He said this.

1120
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,960
At that time,

1121
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,760
he really wanted to be your group.

1122
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,040
That's why he wants

1123
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,480
to exchange.

1124
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
He has been hesitating

1125
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,560
between me and Xinxin.

1126
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,480
In the end, he still wants me

1127
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,600
to meet more boys.

1128
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,480
I talked about him.

1129
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
I said you made me...

1130
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,680
Yeah, so I was confused.

1131
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
And I didn't...

1132
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,560
I...

1133
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,880
I thought about

1134
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,600
I wanted to talk to him.

1135
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,720
But I don't have the courage.

1136
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,520
So I came to ask his sister today.

1137
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
Why didn't you ask him?

1138
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,040
Just talk to him.

1139
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
What do you think?

1140
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,800
Are you not satisfied with this result?

1141
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,840
I wouldn't dare to ask.

1142
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,800
So awkward.

1143
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,480
If you hear your own answer

1144
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,560
It's too awkward.

1145
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,880
I think a lot.

1146
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,520
Then don't think about it.

1147
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,240
There's nothing here.

1148
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,760
Okay.

1149
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
Xiaoling is such a

1150
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,360
a delicate person.

1151
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,280
I didn't expect that.

1152
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,000
Xiao Ling

1153
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,520
has a lot of internal activities.

1154
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
And sometimes I feel

1155
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,080
I think I might take the initiative.

1156
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
What did you do

1157
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,960
what you think is proactive?

1158
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,760
At the beach.

1159
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
I wasn't cold at that time.

1160
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,360
I looked at the picture.

1161
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
I said you should wear mine.

1162
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
Then he put on my clothes.

1163
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,680
Then I took it.

1164
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,240
You asked me then.

1165
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,600
Why did I take his clothes

1166
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,240
and he was wearing mine.

1167
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,720
I said maybe because I wanted to.

1168
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,280
I think this is

1169
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,120
to me.

1170
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,760
I think so too.

1171
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,360
I like it when I do this.

1172
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,000
That's why I'm like this.

1173
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm really interested in him.

1174
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,600
I hope

1175
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,760
whether it's about this

1176
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,400
or something else,

1177
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,680
Respond.

1178
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,080
Maybe they should take the initiative.

1179
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,600
Got it.

1180
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,520
I used to think

1181
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
the map was proactive.

1182
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,480
But through tonight's dinner,

1183
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I think Xiao Ling is quite active.

1184
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,040
When was the most memorable day

1185
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,240
in the house?

1186
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,400
For so many days,

1187
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,200
on my birthday.

1188
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
on my birthday.

1189
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,960
Can you describe it?

1190
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,600
When we go out in the afternoon, we eat first.

1191
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,280
But when we were eating,

1192
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,600
he took out

1193
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,680
from him.

1194
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,320
One after another.

1195
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,960
What is it?

1196
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,680
He didn't take it out at once.

1197
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,240
You know?

1198
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,640
He is...

1199
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,040
Cake.

1200
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,120
He gives one

1201
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,040
He gives one.

1202
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,760
What?

1203
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,080
He gave it to me at first.

1204
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,360
He bought me a bracelet.

1205
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,280
He went to Yonghe Palace early this morning.

1206
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
and bought me a bracelet.

1207
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Then he gave me flowers.

1208
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,800
He's like this.

1209
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,360
I'm speechless.

1210
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,920
Actually, there was

1211
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,440
It was my turn after the interview.

1212
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,600
Go on a date with me.

1213
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,760
After the interview,

1214
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,720
to the next day,

1215
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,120
Time was very short.

1216
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,720
You know?

1217
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Tata, but he prepared so much

1218
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,520
in such a short time.

1219
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,760
I think...

1220
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,080
What?

1221
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,840
It's the one online by your brother.

1222
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,240
in your brother's online?

1223
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,880
Or what?

1224
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,680
My brother was involved anyway.

1225
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,360
Your brother's interview.

1226
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,560
I was there too.

1227
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,880
But he helped me

1228
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,320
were all figured out by him.

1229
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
The map and Harry

1230
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,800
Their answers

1231
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,080
are very different.

1232
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,680
Two people.

1233
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,640
Their personalities are very different.

1234
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,800
One is more mature

1235
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,240
and the other

1236
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,480
No.

1237
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,800
The map was mature that day.

1238
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,400
Really?

1239
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,520
Tu went to your interview too.

1240
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,760
Okay, stop it.

1241
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,280
No, that day...

1242
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,800
He didn't go.

1243
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,760
Just with me.

1244
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,080
Yeah, he just communicated.

1245
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,800
He doesn't have any feelings for me.

1246
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,600
That's why I didn't choose him.

1247
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,000
Stop it, Xiaoling's face has changed.

1248
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,480
No.

1249
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:47,920
He didn't.

1250
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,240
He's really boring.

1251
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,840
Really?

1252
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
The map is there too.

1253
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,240
Today I know

1254
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,160
he went on a date with me

1255
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,240
because of his brother.

1256
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
And when I knew

1257
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,480
this news,

1258
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,080
I went too far.

1259
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,440
But I feel

1260
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,120
So I'm Plan 2?

1261
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,240
Am I a backup?

1262
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,280
I feel that way.

1263
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm really embarrassed.

1264
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,720
No, I shouldn't have said it.

1265
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,880
He really doesn't

1266
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,360
want to go on a date with me at all.

1267
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,760
Really.

1268
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,560
It's okay.

1269
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,600
It's not a big problem.

1270
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,040
My brother and I think

1271
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,840
Tu doesn't want it.

1272
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,320
What about my brother?

1273
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,320
He really wants to.

1274
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,280
He really wants to.

1275
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm speechless.

1276
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
I'm thinking

1277
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,000
if he

1278
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,520
was

1279
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,600
Is that why

1280
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,560
So you came to me?

1281
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:48,760
Really?

1282
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,440
Can you do that?

1283
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,960
I don't know.

1284
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,080
But you mean

1285
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,000
Tu told me that

1286
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,880
he was interviewed.

1287
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,200
But you said you have the map.

1288
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,720
Because I made an appointment with Tu.

1289
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,800
In other words,

1290
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,000
someone else dropped him.

1291
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,360
Like this.

1292
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,600
So he probably went to your place first.

1293
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,040
I think...

1294
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,120
I asked a question at the interview.

1295
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,720
I said if you didn't go on a date with me,

1296
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,400
what would happen to you?

1297
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
The map said

1298
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,640
respect and blessing.

1299
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,120
And Harry said

1300
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,640
He said if he can't go on a date with me,

1301
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I rejected him...

1302
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,440
He said he would leave.

1303
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,480
Don't you think the difference is huge?

1304
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:25,840
Of course.

1305
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,920
I choose Harry too.

1306
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,440
Yeah.

1307
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,200
I choose Harry too.

1308
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,880
He really

1309
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,160
for me at all.

1310
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,480
I'm sweating.

1311
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm sweating.

1312
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm the one who's sweating.

1313
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,840
I think I said something wrong.

1314
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,240
Xiao Ling has been eating and drinking.

1315
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,400
I'm distracting myself.

1316
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,320
Otherwise, I'll keep thinking.

1317
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,000
Okay.

1318
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,600
Here.

1319
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,880
I'm quite honest.

1320
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,640
I remember.

1321
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,920
There was a time when we played a game with Tu.

1322
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,560
It was like we were all playing the piano.

1323
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
It seems that after the sports day,

1324
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,360
and started to ask about the drawing.

1325
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,200
about you.

1326
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,400
But I don't think you were there.

1327
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't think so.

1328
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,800
Then they said

1329
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,680
if you're the type

1330
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,480
fall in love at first sight.

1331
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,240
I thought about it for a while.

1332
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:25,760
He said

1333
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,880
I don't know.

1334
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,520
Then I asked him at the sports day

1335
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,280
A picture.

1336
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,120
Have I ever had a crush on you?

1337
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,720
The map says yes.

1338
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,760
When?

1339
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,400
They said you were playing that

1340
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
like a tire.

1341
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,560
He said you looked back and saw him smile.

1342
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,640
Yes, look at him smiling.

1343
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,840
Why should I turn?

1344
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,200
Okay.

1345
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,240
I have a chance.

1346
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,160
He said he was moved at that moment.

1347
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,200
Then I said,

1348
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,280
on the surface,

1349
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:57,760
Okay.

1350
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,720
In my heart,

1351
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,080
I didn't expect that I would control this place.

1352
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,080
She asked me sincerely as soon as she came.

1353
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,120
Soul question.

1354
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,600
Come on.

1355
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,640
You blinked and asked

1356
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
Barbecue I'm hungry

1357
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,320
Okay.

1358
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,560
It's burning.

1359
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,240
Soon.

1360
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,760
Xinjiang mutton skewers.

1361
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,360
Say hello.

1362
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,600
First barbecue

1363
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,640
Five boys' activities.

1364
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,520
You know nothing.

1365
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,840
I'll do it.

1366
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,000
Go inside.

1367
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,400
I like barbecue.

1368
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,520
Let me grill here.

1369
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,120
You two stay here for a while.

1370
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,520
I'll come later.

1371
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,880
I'll accompany you later.

1372
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,920
Sure.

1373
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,280
The former opponents are having barbecue together.

1374
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,640
It's a very warm scene.

1375
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,040
How should I confess?

1376
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,040
I was thinking to be honest.

1377
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,440
Stop thinking about it.

1378
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,120
The day after tomorrow.

1379
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,840
Yes.

1380
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,600
But I can't play that song.

1381
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,280
It's too hard.

1382
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,400
I thought there was a week left.

1383
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,440
I thought I wouldn't be so busy these two days.

1384
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,520
but I've been out for the past two days.

1385
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,960
I was really busy.

1386
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,800
Yeah, I didn't have time to practice.

1387
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,160
I didn't know how to overcome it.

1388
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,480
When we first started dating,

1389
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,840
a long-distance relationship.

1390
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,280
That's the beginning of hell.

1391
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,600
You said you were going to Japan.

1392
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,640
Aren't you going?

1393
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,960
We didn't get the visa.

1394
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,800
It's too late.

1395
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,320
But I don't support you.

1396
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,200
For an unknown result,

1397
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,720
for an unknown result.

1398
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,080
You must focus on your class.

1399
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,400
Don't delay your graduation.

1400
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,880
Yes.

1401
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,120
What are you talking about?

1402
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,280
We're talking about the follow-up.

1403
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,240
Okay.

1404
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,160
I'm almost done.

1405
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:25,360
It's okay.

1406
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,040
They'll do it later.

1407
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,000
Take the stuff.

1408
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,640
Take a few bowls.

1409
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,040
Then...

1410
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,800
OK.

1411
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,120
Yes, just a bowl.

1412
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,960
Terri, Tu, bring the pepper noodles in.

1413
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,880
If it's not spicy enough,

1414
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,640
Add it yourself.

1415
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,200
Okay.

1416
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Have some.

1417
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,640
Bring them all.

1418
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,600
Let's see how many there are.

1419
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,880
Come on.

1420
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
Baba.

1421
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,920
It's comfortable.

1422
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,320
Let's eat.

1423
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,400
Then we start

1424
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,440
Open the blind box.

1425
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,400
Leave sharp questions to the sharp ones.

1426
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,040
Delicious.

1427
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,400
This is spicy beef.

1428
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,360
Cool

1429
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Let's grill some more

1430
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,920
Again. I'll go.

1431
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,320
Let's go out and do it.

1432
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:19,920
Let's go.

1433
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,280
Do you think

1434
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,360
their romantic dinner

1435
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,000
They must be more excited than us.

1436
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,040
Do you think they will ask like me?

1437
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,960
They won't be as formal as us.

1438
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,280
I think

1439
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,320
they won't be so straightforward.

1440
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,640
The picture makes me feel

1441
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,680
He's so unformal.

1442
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,240
So I have to ask him in this tone.

1443
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,040
I think it makes sense.

1444
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,560
If he keeps joking like this,

1445
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,560
But today,

1446
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,440
I think his answer

1447
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,080
gave you

1448
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,960
a clear answer.

1449
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,160
Indeed.

1450
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,360
He's still in this state.

1451
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,560
Is the answer good or bad?

1452
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,960
I think it's him.

1453
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,720
It's him.

1454
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,560
But I think

1455
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,480
Tu Tu's answer today

1456
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,520
Let me hear it.

1457
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,160
I think it's sincere.

1458
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,480
He said

1459
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,640
his own thoughts.

1460
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,680
Because you can't ask

1461
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,480
to ask a kid

1462
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
So I said

1463
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,480
I don't support my brothers.

1464
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,440
But it depends on Xiao Ling.

1465
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,600
Your brother will have his own judgment.

1466
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,560
Yes.

1467
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,560
Come in first

1468
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,280
Let's eat first.

1469
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,960
Eat first.

1470
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,840
We can ask a question.

1471
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,320
I think...

1472
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,240
I'll open it.

1473
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,560
Open it.

1474
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,280
I'll open it.

1475
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,320
Do you accept men

1476
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,840
a man you're meeting?

1477
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,560
Why?

1478
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,560
I don't accept it.

1479
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,880
Because I think

1480
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,160
men need to take the initiative.

1481
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,200
Maybe before he

1482
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,480
his feelings,

1483
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,320
I don't want my brother

1484
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,720
to be the one who takes the initiative.

1485
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,360
At first, Tu Tu took the initiative to find Xiaoling.

1486
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,080
But every time

1487
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,720
further,

1488
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,520
The map will distract your attention.

1489
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,920
or retreat.

1490
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,600
She's confused.

1491
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,360
She doesn't know what it means.

1492
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
Actually, I don't mean much to the map.

1493
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,800
It's just that Xiao Ling is upset.

1494
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,480
Besides, it's not Xiaoling's problem.

1495
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
He said no firmly.

1496
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,320
I didn't know if I should laugh

1497
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,120
or cry.

1498
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,080
I think we need to communicate

1499
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,280
with Xiaoling.

1500
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,000
I need to communicate with them

1501
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,880
I can tell them

1502
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,280
the answer to a guarantee.

1503
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,400
What about you?

1504
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,920
I might think it's inappropriate before the map.

1505
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,400
But after so many days together,

1506
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,040
I think

1507
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,680
Not bad.

1508
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,080
Yes.

1509
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,000
I think my idea

1510
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,080
shouldn't be here.

1511
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,560
I respect my sister.

1512
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,520
My sister likes it.

1513
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,720
she'll pursue it.

1514
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,320
I'll accept it.

1515
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,600
So my sister wants to

1516
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,320
Then pursue it boldly.

1517
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,000
and love boldly.

1518
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,520
Next question.

1519
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,600
The man you're meeting

1520
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,400
has broken your ideal type?

1521
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,200
Which aspect?

1522
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,360
I didn't break it.

1523
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,800
Because on the first day I chose myself,

1524
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,960
I was interested in at first sight.

1525
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,480
My brother and I had the same answer.

1526
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,360
are the same.

1527
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,640
chose Xiao Ling.

1528
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,320
Let me give you an example.

1529
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,720
It's mine.

1530
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,640
Normal (ideal type)

1531
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,280
So

1532
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,680
on the first day,

1533
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,320
when Xin voted for my ideal type,

1534
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,480
she voted for Hua.

1535
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,200
She's perfect for her type.

1536
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,480
I...

1537
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,920
Kind of.

1538
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,640
Because I'm actually more interested in the feeling.

1539
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,520
Is it ideal or not?

1540
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,520
I just feel it.

1541
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,840
He's my type.

1542
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,240
You've never had such kind of

1543
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,160
like this before?

1544
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,760
The genre I talked about before

1545
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,880
is quite different.

1546
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,080
Got it.

1547
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,360
I think I broke

1548
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,000
I used to

1549
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,480
a cool and handsome girl.

1550
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,400
But maybe

1551
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,520
I feel more awkward

1552
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,280
with a cool and cool girl.

1553
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,280
They don't talk at all.

1554
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,840
They don't take the initiative.

1555
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,520
When there's a problem, you'll be depressed.

1556
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,480
At the end,

1557
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,360
I couldn't get along with him at all.

1558
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,240
And

1559
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,760
I found a cute one.

1560
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,600
And I was very moved.

1561
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,160
Let me answer it.

1562
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,120
Actually I had contact with Xinxin before.

1563
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,880
At that time, I thought

1564
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,080
Xinxin could get along with me

1565
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,240
and understand me better.

1566
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,160
I thought

1567
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,200
he might be older than me.

1568
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,760
So I thought I could get in touch with him.

1569
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,640
Then I found

1570
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,280
we actually sat in the same car

1571
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,480
we actually took a car.

1572
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,080
We chatted

1573
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,320
we couldn't talk about much.

1574
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,360
Then we met Tata on a date.

1575
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,600
Tata made a breakthrough.

1576
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,520
my ideal type.

1577
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,760
I really don't like girls with short hair.

1578
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,720
I don't mean

1579
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,680
they are not good-looking.

1580
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,400
They just don't fit my taste.

1581
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,080
Then we got closer

1582
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,760
and better.

1583
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,680
I think she's pretty.

1584
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,400
including her personality.

1585
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,520
in terms of personality.

1586
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,680
and the three views.

1587
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,200
Indeed.

1588
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,720
I think when you first met girls,

1589
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,880
when you first met girls.

1590
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
So I think it makes sense.

1591
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,920
From the beginning,

1592
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
from the beginning,

1593
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,960
I didn't think your style was good.

1594
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,760
In the end, I have a feeling

1595
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
in the end,

1596
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,520
I think it's good.

1597
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,240
I think it's good

1598
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,880
should be decisive.

1599
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,040
I agree

1600
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,000
I agree with you.

1601
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,320
Fatty, come on.

1602
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,440
Ask a relaxing question.

1603
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,400
Who was your competitor in the small house?

1604
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,720
Easy.

1605
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,080
Tae-seo and I...

1606
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,680
Where's the soup?

1607
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,040
I was just competing with Tae-seo.

1608
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,720
Fair competition?

1609
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,240
We both said in the restaurant

1610
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,280
our friendship

1611
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,680
our friendship.

1612
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,720
Do you know Fatty

1613
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,600
in the beginning?

1614
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,160
I think that's what he meant.

1615
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,840
Because he had contact with Hua before.

1616
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,200
I think he is more

1617
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,160
more about flowers.

1618
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,760
Then he may say

1619
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,680
get to know him more.

1620
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,480
Then he and Xiaoling

1621
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,600
He didn't give me an answer.

1622
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,720
So many things

1623
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,280
have been passed by him.

1624
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,400
This is the kind of message

1625
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,720
I hesitated the most.

1626
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,360
I was most hesitant at that time.

1627
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,440
on the day of the Sports Day.

1628
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,480
Who should I send it to?

1629
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,840
To Xinxin.

1630
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
or to Tata?

1631
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,160
I sent it to Tata.

1632
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,240
I had a great chat with her

1633
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,160
I thought we had a good chat.

1634
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,600
Then...

1635
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,960
I just finished my date.

1636
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,920
I said,

1637
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,800
it must be her.

1638
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,800
I hesitated that day.

1639
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,760
Yes.

1640
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,640
I've never hesitated.

1641
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm not hesitant either.

1642
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,040
Okay.

1643
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,480
I hesitated.

1644
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,200
I was hesitant on the third day.

1645
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,880
The third day after the snow (sports day),

1646
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,480
I hesitated to send it to Hua.

1647
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,880
or Xiaoling.

1648
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,160
I hesitated about them.

1649
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,160
I think every day's message

1650
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,960
is to express how we get along.

1651
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,040
It doesn't mean

1652
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,160
is a positive

1653
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,840
to express

1654
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,960
in my heart.

1655
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,640
He didn't say if he was hesitant.

1656
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,960
He keeps giving

1657
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,920
the vague answer.

1658
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm quite angry.

1659
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,920
Do you want to see your green pepper leather?

1660
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,960
I'll take a look.

1661
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Green pepper.

1662
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:22,920
No.

1663
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Fatty's performance is obvious, right?

1664
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,120
She was interested in Xiao Ling at first.

1665
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,320
In the mid-term,

1666
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,480
During the winter sports day

1667
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,080
Yes.

1668
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,880
He...

1669
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,600
The map doesn't know?

1670
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
He...

1671
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,440
I don't know if he knows.

1672
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,720
I think he might know.

1673
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,920
He said he didn't feel it.

1674
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,800
But maybe he was embarrassed.

1675
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,560
Most importantly,

1676
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,880
everyone can

1677
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,400
what it means.

1678
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,120
You said you were firm.

1679
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,040
You said you were sincere.

1680
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,400
Then you did nothing.

1681
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,400
Then I should be responsible for my sister.

1682
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,120
Are you full?

1683
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,000
A little.

1684
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,040
I'm full too.

1685
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,240
Tu wants to eat green pepper.

1686
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:03,680
Eat.

1687
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,440
Eat spicy food.

1688
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,160
I baked it for him.

1689
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,640
Eat these two burnt ones.

1690
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,480
It'll be better.

1691
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,680
Blind box.

1692
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,720
Thank you.

1693
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,800
You're sweating.

1694
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,240
Who goes first?

1695
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,000
Anything.

1696
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,960
Xiao Ling, you go first.

1697
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,320
Let's go along.

1698
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,280
What happens now

1699
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,200
will change your final choice.

1700
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,160
So sharp.

1701
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,240
Can we sit closer?

1702
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,880
Nervous.

1703
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,920
I got goose bumps.

1704
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,480
I don't know how to answer this question.

1705
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,320
What does he do?

1706
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,800
Will you consider age or distance?

1707
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,760
I think

1708
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,800
I think the age is good.

1709
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,960
I did consider the distance.

1710
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,760
Is there a distance between you two?

1711
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,920
He's busy.

1712
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,000
He always goes out.

1713
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,640
He may get 90 points

1714
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,760
to 99,

1715
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,680
I will change.

1716
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,000
Really.

1717
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,480
Not even a penny.

1718
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,560
Not even a penny.

1719
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,800
You're so scary, He Wenxin.

1720
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,280
I understand He Wenxin

1721
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,240
can do this.

1722
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
But you can't do this.

1723
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:28,880
Right?

1724
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,320
Indeed, I can't either.

1725
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,880
I...

1726
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,640
can only go like this.

1727
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,600
You can't.

1728
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,560
Yes, he can go from zero to 90.

1729
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,240
He can't start from 100.

1730
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,040
to 99.

1731
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,680
Don't make people feel down.

1732
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,480
Then mine is...

1733
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,760
Maybe what?

1734
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,520
Maybe he'll get to know someone else.

1735
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,000
What about you?

1736
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,600
I'm touched.

1737
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,120
Someone suddenly

1738
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,640
touched you.

1739
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,800
You were very determined. Yeah.

1740
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,560
Then you will

1741
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,320
stick to yourself.

1742
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,840
Yes.

1743
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,320
I think before eating today,

1744
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,480
I don't dare to

1745
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,560
I dare not listen.

1746
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,600
Listen.

1747
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,280
Before dinner today,

1748
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,280
I was confused.

1749
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,160
And I asked you

1750
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,480
Are you satisfied?

1751
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,360
I think it's okay.

1752
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,520
But I'm more curious

1753
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,280
what he said.

1754
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,360
OK.

1755
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
So I think

1756
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,760
my final choice to change.

1757
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,720
Maybe

1758
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,560
his answer

1759
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,640
or his answer,

1760
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,600
or my feelings.

1761
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Because I will consider my age.

1762
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,600
I'll think about distance.

1763
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,320
Plus me and Tu.

1764
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,880
I'm a student now.

1765
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,560
The map is...

1766
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,880
I guess he's a freshman or sophomore.

1767
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,480
(Big) 2.

1768
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,880
It's hard to say when I'm studying.

1769
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,320
for a long time.

1770
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,840
So this is what I think about.

1771
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,560
To be honest,

1772
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,600
I'm the youngest and think the most.

1773
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,360
Am I the youngest?

1774
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,520
Yes.

1775
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,480
You're right.

1776
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,320
Because if I'm in a relationship,

1777
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,040
I do want to

1778
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,840
I will. It's a bit scary to say this,

1779
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,280
But I want to get married.

1780
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,560
But it's good.

1781
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,640
So I think

1782
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,480
I have a lot to think about.

1783
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,920
The second question.

1784
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,640
Who was your competitor in the room?

1785
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,520
competitor?

1786
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,920
You don't seem to have one.

1787
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,480
You didn't.

1788
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,520
You...

1789
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,120
I'm sorry.

1790
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,560
Yes, I...

1791
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,560
Really?

1792
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,360
I'm not sure.

1793
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,640
Come on. You don't have it.

1794
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,440
No.

1795
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,160
There was.

1796
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,600
No.

1797
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,640
OK.

1798
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,120
I know Xinxin.

1799
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,000
Yes.

1800
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,200
Xinxin had contact with Harry at the beginning.

1801
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,080
Yes.

1802
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,320
Including the invitation card he refused me.

1803
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,680
and walk out with Xinxin.

1804
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,000
I also said that

1805
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,120
Xin and Harry look great together.

1806
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,640
Do you remember?

1807
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,640
I didn't hear that.

1808
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,800
I heard it.

1809
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,800
behind them.

1810
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,120
behind them.

1811
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,440
After you left with him,

1812
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:41,920
behind you.

1813
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,120
They look great together.

1814
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,680
You...

1815
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,720
Your competitor is her?

1816
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,360
Yes.

1817
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,480
Who are you with?

1818
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,080
Fatty?

1819
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,040
Yes, Fatty was in contact with me.

1820
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,200
Then I went to her the next day and the third day.

1821
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,760
Yes.

1822
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,160
OK.

1823
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,240
Who was my competitor?

1824
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,480
I don't know.

1825
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,280
Actually, after dinner, I think it might be Tata.

1826
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,040
Just once.

1827
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,440
I think it's Tata after dinner.

1828
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,280
Tata.

1829
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,120
(I want to escape.)

1830
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,880
I want to drink water.

1831
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
It's my turn.

1832
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,440
I'll ask first.

1833
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,720
Then I'll start with you, Mi Zi.

1834
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,800
Okay.

1835
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,440
At this stage, your siblings and interest

1836
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,800
The occupation in your heart

1837
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,560
Question mark

1838
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,360
I think my brothers

1839
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,600
my brothers must be at least mine.

1840
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:36,920
Not good.

1841
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,200
But at least 80%.

1842
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,160
I'll put my love

1843
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,880
I would also think

1844
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,400
But to put it bluntly,

1845
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,640
you can't beat my brothers.

1846
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,480
It's normal.

1847
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,640
It's normal.

1848
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,120
I dare not say it.

1849
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Yes, because I really...

1850
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,040
Just like what Xiaoling asked me,

1851
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,880
I did choke.

1852
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,320
Because recently,

1853
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,440
I don't really care about the drawing.

1854
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,080
the relationship situation.

1855
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,760
In the beginning,

1856
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,960
in the beginning,

1857
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,480
he may be most focused on him.

1858
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,600
But you have to ask me about the recent occupation.

1859
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,640
I think the map only accounts for 30.

1860
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,440
I might have seventy.

1861
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,200
Because my brother diary also said

1862
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,680
I feel sorry for him.

1863
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,480
But it seems

1864
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,760
I was in the small house.

1865
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,120
In the next stage,

1866
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,920
I will

1867
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,280
pay more attention to my feelings

1868
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,040
or myself.

1869
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,840
that I haven't figured out yet.

1870
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,120
Yes.

1871
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,880
I think even if I give him the map,

1872
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,720
give him one percent,

1873
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,040
I don't think I'm afraid of him being angry.

1874
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,400
Because I know he won't leave.

1875
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,760
But if my boyfriend sees it,

1876
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,400
will leave.

1877
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,280
Yes.

1878
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,960
he would think

1879
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,720
if you only give me one percent,

1880
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,400
I think they will.

1881
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,600
But I don't think they will.

1882
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,640
Just like when you quarrel with your friends,

1883
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,360
It's totally different from quarreling with your family.

1884
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
My friend asked me

1885
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,840
when you came in,

1886
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,480
no one likes you.

1887
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,200
I said it's okay. My brother likes me.

1888
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,840
Even if I'm here,

1889
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
I haven't found the one I like,

1890
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,720
my brother will be

1891
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,800
at any corner.

1892
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,160
It's hard to answer.

1893
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,280
My brothers are not here.

1894
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,720
I completely forgot him these days.

1895
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,920
Then you'll be zero and 100.

1896
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Since the siblings' house closed,

1897
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,840
I've never thought of my brother.

1898
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,160
We can still

1899
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:19,960
60 percent.

1900
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,800
I think

1901
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
you're just like me.

1902
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,400
Fine, I'm the heartless one.

1903
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,720
You can't say that.

1904
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,760
After all,

1905
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,200
for that long.

1906
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Me too.

1907
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,120
I don't have anyone I like right now.

1908
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,000
But if I do,

1909
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,680
Fatty should be

1910
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
60 percent.

1911
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,040
Me too.

1912
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,400
Like this.

1913
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,880
Just 40?

1914
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,120
Six? How can we have four?

1915
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,240
10,000 percent.

1916
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,160
No, in the beginning,

1917
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,240
I didn't expect

1918
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,680
I would care so much about Tom.

1919
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,000
To be honest, I cried

1920
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,960
because he cried.

1921
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,320
It's also the first time

1922
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,720
I cried for the first time.

1923
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
So I thought

1924
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,840
he was with me.

1925
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,720
Actually, before I came here,

1926
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,560
I didn't think

1927
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,520
to me.

1928
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,480
The person you're seeing

1929
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,600
because you really like him,

1930
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,440
or find a partner?

1931
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,720
I don't think I have the map now.

1932
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,280
Listen carefully.

1933
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,960
I don't really like

1934
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,320
hang it on him every day.

1935
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,640
But I'm really interested in him.

1936
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,360
I really like him.

1937
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,640
I'm really interested.

1938
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,160
I can't say I like you, but...

1939
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,920
Feelings?

1940
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,640
Yes.

1941
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,520
Me too.

1942
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,040
I really like Xiaoling.

1943
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,160
I'm not looking for a partner.

1944
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,600
What about you?

1945
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,560
Of course I'm sincere.

1946
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,240
Do you really like him or do you really like him?

1947
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,440
So annoying.

1948
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
I won't answer.

1949
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,200
Tell me. Do you like him or do you like him?

1950
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,520
Maybe between the two.

1951
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,120
Yes, I think...

1952
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:08,480
Xinxin.

1953
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,840
I don't need to say that she didn't even find a partner.

1954
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,360
Esther Dok-mi.

1955
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,400
Okay.

1956
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,560
I skipped it.

1957
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,440
I don't have to answer.

1958
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,480
Answer me.

1959
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,480
Answer.

1960
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,480
I have to answer.

1961
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:20,920
No.

1962
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,680
I'm not thinking.

1963
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,800
I'm not looking for a partner.

1964
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,440
Do you really like him or...

1965
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,640
I asked

1966
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,080
Just like Tata.

1967
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,000
I don't want to answer.

1968
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,440
You just asked me

1969
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,480
Because I asked for someone else.

1970
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,320
I'll ask.

1971
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,040
In the last two days,

1972
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,440
will you still assist your brothers?

1973
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,920
You scared me.

1974
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,240
I don't think

1975
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,520
my assistance anymore.

1976
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,840
I think they are good, right?

1977
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
I don't need them anymore.

1978
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,680
Why are you asking me this?

1979
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,080
Is there any need to ask me?

1980
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,800
I think they're living a good life.

1981
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,160
They all live well.

1982
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,360
That's great.

1983
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,320
He's been in a relationship.

1984
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,120
He doesn't need my help or understanding girls.

1985
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I've always been

1986
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,280
a gossipy character.

1987
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,720
I'm not assisting.

1988
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,440
Of course.

1989
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,000
Let me do it.

1990
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,160
Do you accept

1991
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,880
the man your brother is in contact with?

1992
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,480
Why?

1993
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,640
I accept it.

1994
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,680
I think it's good. Go on.

1995
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,440
Thank you.

1996
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,560
Guess if I accept it.

1997
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,280
I'm nervous.

1998
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,720
Be careful.

1999
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,000
I accept it.

2000
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,280
Helping every day is tiring.

2001
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,200
He nags at both sides every day.

2002
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,120
Very acceptable

2003
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,760
Me too.

2004
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,360
I agree with anyone he meets.

2005
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,440
What about you?

2006
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,400
How about you? How can you skip

2007
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,760
Where is the man

2008
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,040
Where?

2009
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,800
Just pretend to be Tae-seo.

2010
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,400
and Tae-seo.

2011
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Is Tae-seo in touch with Hwa-hwa?

2012
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,440
Yes, I do.

2013
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,200
Thank you.

2014
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,680
Do you accept it?

2015
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,320
Yes.

2016
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,160
I'm the one

2017
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,240
I said I'll accept it.

2018
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,680
I don't even think I deserve him.

2019
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,480
Have you broken

2020
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,840
your ideal type?

2021
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,040
I don't have a ideal type.

2022
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,640
If you ask me what my type is,

2023
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,320
I'll say I want it.

2024
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,680
I might be over 18cm tall.

2025
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,840
Me too.

2026
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,840
How high is the map?

2027
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,880
1.77 meters.

2028
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,680
Let me write it down.

2029
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
In fact, I would say

2030
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,960
I hope they are taller than me.

2031
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,840
What do I want?

2032
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
But now I'm going to say

2033
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,960
Mine is totally different

2034
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,720
They look different.

2035
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,000
I like

2036
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,480
He's young.

2037
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,680
She's white and cute.

2038
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,640
Map.

2039
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,720
I have a new competitor.

2040
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,840
So scary.

2041
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,840
You should answer the question later.

2042
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,040
Yes, the order is very important.

2043
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,080
No, it's just...

2044
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,760
But the picture is too cute.

2045
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,560
I like the “father” of a teenager.

2046
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,280
He is older than me

2047
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
and good at taking care of people.

2048
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,680
But he looks like

2049
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,200
a man.

2050
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,880
Yes.

2051
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,600
But psychological age and physical age

2052
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,720
are older than me.

2053
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,000
and take care of me.

2054
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,760
And he will guide me.

2055
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,160
instead of me.

2056
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,160
Now it's the opposite.

2057
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,479
It's the opposite now.

2058
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,920
And what's funniest about me

2059
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,680
when I was in England,

2060
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,319
when I was in England.

2061
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,439
if I went

2062
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,720
to contact foreigners

2063
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,399
or something like that.

2064
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:31,160
I said it's impossible.

2065
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,920
Now...

2066
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,279
The result

2067
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,720
I didn't expect it at all.

2068
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,880
Totally different

2069
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,800
She's so happy to hear it

2070
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,720
Yes, it's all about feeling

2071
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,640
The man I'm meeting

2072
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,399
is totally different from my ideal type.

2073
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,920
Totally different.

2074
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,439
I like those who are taller than me

2075
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,399
and older than me.

2076
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,120
I never...

2077
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,319
I was very against having a younger brother at first.

2078
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,160
I agree. I've never been in a relationship.

2079
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
Me too.

2080
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,359
Because for the peers,

2081
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:01,000
boys

2082
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,479
childish.

2083
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,279
They're all childish.

2084
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:02,800
Yes.

2085
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,160
But I knew his age at first.

2086
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,040
After getting close to Harry,

2087
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,000
I think he is actually

2088
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,800
quite mature.

2089
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,760
I like Harry's personality.

2090
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,760
I really like

2091
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,640
who is very thoughtful.

2092
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,240
I actually like

2093
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,560
older than me.

2094
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,319
I know age yesterday.

2095
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,240
I found that

2096
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,560
not much older than me.

2097
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,439
Tae-seo.

2098
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,120
Tae-seo is the same age as her.

2099
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,040
Same age?

2100
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,200
Yes, not much.

2101
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,439
But I think

2102
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:34,560
Whether it's the first or later contact,

2103
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,640
I think it's okay.

2104
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,080
They're all over 1.8 meters tall.

2105
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,760
I think

2106
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,359
to silence two women in one sentence.

2107
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,000
Yes, she's excellent.

2108
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,960
I think it's good.

2109
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,920
When you enter the house,

2110
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,000
You and your brothers have changed the most

2111
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,800
in love and life? Why?

2112
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,760
I think for me,

2113
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,240
the change in love and life

2114
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,480
Maybe half.

2115
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,000
Because in love,

2116
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,520
I never thought

2117
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,600
I would have the definition of my ideal type.

2118
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,640
I didn't expect

2119
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,400
I would be interested in the map now.

2120
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,240
Because he's not my type.

2121
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,720
In terms of life,

2122
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,360
as I mentioned just now,

2123
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,000
I might have met my brother before.

2124
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,440
I would be a passerby A, a passerby B.

2125
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,800
But now you will realize the difference.

2126
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,360
And for my brother,

2127
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,840
I never thought

2128
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,440
he would stand on the stage

2129
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,160
and express his feelings.

2130
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,520
This is something he has never done before.

2131
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,480
Besides,

2132
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,280
he doesn't even

2133
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,760
He didn't even get on the stage.

2134
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,320
We cried for each other once.

2135
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,080
I think

2136
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,920
I've never seen this before.

2137
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,240
I think he has changed a lot in life.

2138
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,040
Because he may be

2139
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,280
afraid of the camera.

2140
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,680
Yes, before he came,

2141
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,480
before he came.

2142
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,720
I don't want to come.

2143
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,320
I think I'll think a lot.

2144
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,240
What if I can't finish my paper?

2145
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,560
What if no one likes me?

2146
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,360
It's a mess.

2147
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,720
After I came here,

2148
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,280
he's much better than me.

2149
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,440
Yeah.

2150
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,640
And his feelings...

2151
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,440
But he's always

2152
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,920
is always sincere and passionate.

2153
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,480
and good to girls.

2154
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,640
So I don't think

2155
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,600
make girls feel a sense of gap.

2156
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,400
In my life,

2157
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,040
in my life.

2158
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,920
In terms of love,

2159
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,360
I feel I've changed a lot.

2160
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,880
I used to be very boring.

2161
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,600
I was so frustrated.

2162
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,080
In my life,

2163
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,240
I may never take the initiative. Never.

2164
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,040
let alone to take the initiative

2165
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,400
to clear up the misunderstanding

2166
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,680
or talk to others.

2167
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,040
Yes.

2168
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,600
I was a very passive person.

2169
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,040
Yes.

2170
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,200
My turn.

2171
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,120
I think I've changed a lot

2172
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:45,880
in life.

2173
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,960
I lived alone for a long time.

2174
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,480
There are many people in the small house.

2175
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,520
I started to ask

2176
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,000
what you want and what I want.

2177
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,280
You may care about others

2178
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,840
and take care of others.

2179
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,000
And when he gets fat,

2180
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,720
So does he.

2181
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,480
Well,

2182
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,520
We are both independent in life.

2183
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,000
So the changes in life

2184
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,160
in life.

2185
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,200
But in love,

2186
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,760
I think he has changed.

2187
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,880
He's usually very decisive.

2188
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,200
and straightforward.

2189
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,440
and deal with emotions.

2190
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,120
He might not be hesitant.

2191
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,000
And when he comes here,

2192
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,240
don't want to miss it.

2193
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,800
and think a lot.

2194
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,920
I'm struggling with thoughts every day.

2195
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,160
and thinking about many things.

2196
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,960
Seeing his hesitant side,

2197
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,120
I'm very happy.

2198
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,840
Yeah, he doesn't have to say anything about me.

2199
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,640
Because he thinks

2200
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,000
he did a good job.

2201
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,280
Then he would think

2202
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,760
I thought I didn't do well enough.

2203
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,960
Now I say

2204
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,720
Did you do well?

2205
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,320
So what right do you have to criticize me?

2206
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,400
He said I'll never talk about you again.

2207
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,760
You can fly freely from now on.

2208
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,400
I...

2209
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,800
I'll just say that I don't have any siblings.

2210
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,720
And I

2211
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,280
life has not changed much.

2212
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,040
It's almost the same.

2213
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,400
In terms of relationship,

2214
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,000
in love.

2215
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,680
I'm the kind of party

2216
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,480
I'm the kind of person

2217
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,200
I won't take the initiative to fit in with everyone.

2218
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,000
I'll be alone.

2219
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,880
without talking.

2220
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,720
But since I came here,

2221
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,640
more active in all aspects.

2222
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,800
I'll play with everyone.

2223
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,040
and talk together.

2224
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,040
In terms of relationship,

2225
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,840
like Susu.

2226
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,160
I'm also a passive person.

2227
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,600
But I'm here

2228
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,400
I have a clear understanding

2229
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,720
very clearly.

2230
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,280
I think I'm quite active

2231
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,360
in some aspects.

2232
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,160
I didn't expect this, actually.

2233
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,840
Jiayi, I agree.

2234
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:39,600
Well,

2235
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,120
I think he might

2236
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,200
in love.

2237
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,200
Because I've never been involved.

2238
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,480
From knowing and pursuing,

2239
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,440
from knowing and pursuing.

2240
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,600
So I saw him

2241
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,400
he was sticking to you.

2242
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,120
around the girl he likes.

2243
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,520
Because I used to feel

2244
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,520
someone was around him.

2245
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,840
So I'm taking the initiative now.

2246
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,520
Right?

2247
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,120
Yes. So this time,

2248
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,800
I saw him taking the initiative.

2249
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,760
Maybe you can't feel it.

2250
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,320
To me,

2251
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,120
I don't think he's proactive.

2252
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,760
This is what I really want to say.

2253
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,240
And in life,

2254
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,360
I have no worries about eating, sleeping and eating.

2255
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,080
Yes.

2256
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,400
The only difference is

2257
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,720
when I was in a bad mood,

2258
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,440
he made four glutinous rice balls for me.

2259
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,640
The burnt glutinous rice balls.

2260
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,520
As for me,

2261
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,120
I think my relationship and life

2262
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,000
have changed a lot.

2263
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,920
Actually, when I came here,

2264
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,560
I think my first best friend

2265
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,640
is Xinxin.

2266
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,560
But I feel a little awkward.

2267
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,640
I don't dare to approach her.

2268
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,400
Why?

2269
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,560
Because of the chubby relationship?

2270
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,960
I don't know if it's sensitive or something.

2271
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,160
I also feel that

2272
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,360
we can talk about everything

2273
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,440
We can talk about everything.

2274
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,200
It's not that good.

2275
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,720
So I think

2276
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,120
I've been avoiding you on purpose.

2277
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,640
I don't know if you noticed

2278
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,080
I dare not say too much to you.

2279
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,360
Because I think

2280
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,480
It's not good to say it too much.

2281
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,160
I have the same feeling as you.

2282
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,120
Yes, I'm actually a little scared.

2283
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,400
You gave me too many messages.

2284
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,880
Because I think a lot.

2285
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,560
Then I translated it to Fatty.

2286
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,680
Another version.

2287
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,000
Yes.

2288
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,280
Because my emotions

2289
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,160
a lot.

2290
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,040
Flower told me.

2291
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,000
I’ll give it to him.

2292
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,640
Then his fire started again.

2293
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
He thinks I can do it again.

2294
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,040
I'm going to go again.

2295
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,520
He said I'm going to confess.

2296
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,240
I was afraid that he would do this.

2297
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,240
I'm very flat.

2298
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,360
When he asked me these days,

2299
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,280
I would say,

2300
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,880
I was thinking about myself.

2301
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,880
In my opinion,

2302
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,400
if you choose any boy in the house,

2303
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,880
I will give my best wishes.

2304
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,240
I think it won't affect

2305
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,640
our friendship.

2306
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:37,960
Because of him,

2307
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,800
we might get closer.

2308
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,920
but it won't affect me.

2309
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,400
how much I like you.

2310
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,960
or the degree of us being together

2311
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,480
when you're with anyone,

2312
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,320
I will be happy

2313
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,080
and happy for you.

2314
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,880
Yes.

2315
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,560
Cheers.

2316
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,680
Cheers.

2317
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,840
In your eyes yesterday,

2318
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,400
we were dramatic, right?

2319
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,120
I'm in a group with Tarri and Fatty.

2320
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:02,720
But let me tell you,

2321
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,240
Fatty was really good yesterday.

2322
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,360
What do you mean?

2323
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,400
He didn't embarrass me.

2324
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,800
I think he's afraid.

2325
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,200
I might be pushed to the edge of the storm.

2326
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,520
He will take the initiative

2327
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,400
to avoid some trouble.

2328
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,960
Stop sending good people cards.

2329
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,640
I didn't post it. It's really good.

2330
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,840
Stop praising him.

2331
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,560
We're talking about girls.

2332
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,160
You don't need to praise him.

2333
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,480
The information is bad again.

2334
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,000
Yes.

2335
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,480
Because I told you

2336
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,520
My ears are very big now.

2337
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,120
Fatty said I wanted to confess.

2338
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,120
It's burning again.

2339
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,320
It's burning again.

2340
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,080
His speech on the second floor

2341
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,680
He said he was angry

2342
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,440
is that

2343
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,480
I met Tae-seo at the same time.

2344
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,760
I didn't tell him either.

2345
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,360
or explained it to him.

2346
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,280
But he told me

2347
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,280
he said you could contact Terri.

2348
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:46,880
I'm fine.

2349
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,360
He said I'm an adult.

2350
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,080
But if you contact him,

2351
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,120
Hua, can you stop here?

2352
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,160
Don't touch Tae-seo at the same time.

2353
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,680
If you touch me at the same time,

2354
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,520
I'm chasing Tae-seo.

2355
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,560
He's chasing me.

2356
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,840
which makes him embarrassed.

2357
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,480
His speech was very manly.

2358
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,080
Really responsible.

2359
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,760
After listening to it,

2360
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,080
I wanted to cry.

2361
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,960
I would think

2362
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,160
Is it because I'm touched or touched?

2363
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,920
It's useless to be touched.

2364
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,520
Love needs to be moved.

2365
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,640
than touching.

2366
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,000
If I didn't come in,

2367
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,520
if I didn't come in,

2368
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,240
you and Harry will continue to understand.

2369
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,400
If Tata didn't come in,

2370
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,400
my understanding with Harry

2371
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,160
I think we'll be friends.

2372
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,840
And Harry is quite frank.

2373
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,440
Because I remember

2374
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,120
my first Cupid date.

2375
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,600
He texted me that day.

2376
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,320
The content is...

2377
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,680
Thank you.

2378
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,680
who made me feel comfortable.

2379
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,760
And I said he was so honest.

2380
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,560
When I got along with him,

2381
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,600
Sometimes I feel

2382
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,680
Why does he always go clubbing in my minefield?

2383
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,560
Yeah, so does he.

2384
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,880
dancing in my minefield.

2385
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,720
At the beginning, Fatty

2386
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,720
Fatty kept saying

2387
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,920
Why did you send it to him?

2388
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,400
Then I said,

2389
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,680
because we talked a lot.

2390
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,880
Everyone else

2391
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,400
with others.

2392
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,040
I knew

2393
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,640
after the date with you that day,

2394
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,320
he sent it to you.

2395
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,800
I didn't...

2396
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,320
But I didn't send it to him that day.

2397
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,600
because I sent it to the map.

2398
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,400
But there was actually a mistake.

2399
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,560
I received

2400
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,440
a message from him.

2401
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,120
But he didn't send it.

2402
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,160
It's from Tae-ri.

2403
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:20,640
Did you think Harry sent it?

2404
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,280
I thought it was from Harry.

2405
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,440
Fatty was a little angry that day.

2406
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,280
Because he thought

2407
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,040
I didn't know what he meant.

2408
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,600
Later I told him

2409
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,320
he didn't send it to me.

2410
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,680
He said it makes sense.

2411
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,200
It makes sense.

2412
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,880
If he texts me

2413
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,360
when he goes out with you.

2414
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,160
I think it's a little strange.

2415
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,400
I think it's weird.

2416
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,560
But after the date with you,

2417
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,960
he was sure

2418
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,480
And the two of us

2419
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,520
had no extra contact.

2420
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
He is very clear

2421
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,080
what type he likes

2422
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,080
What kind of girl do you want?

2423
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,840
If we came in together,

2424
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,160
he would

2425
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,320
the first second.

2426
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,400
Does the soup like you?

2427
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,480
I know him well.

2428
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,880
He used to like handsome girls.

2429
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,320
That's you.

2430
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,240
You're handsome.

2431
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,040
But it's totally different now.

2432
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,680
Thank you.

2433
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,360
I got a message.

2434
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,160
There's a message.

2435
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,800
Confession is coming.

2436
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,920
Do you need a date to make up for your regret?

2437
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,160
to vote for the person who has no regrets.

2438
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,440
Do you need it?

2439
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,160
Whether I have the chance or not,

2440
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,000
I'll talk to him.

2441
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,200
I want to get to know Tae-seo more.

2442
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,240
Actually, I think

2443
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,120
I need this chance.

2444
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,040
Actually, Tata and I

2445
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:35,960
close to Tata.

2446
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,960
It's only been two days.

2447
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,440
Bro.

2448
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:38,920
I vote for you.

2449
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:39,680
Here.

2450
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,320
I got a message.

2451
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,960
I received that text saying

2452
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,560
I had a date to make up for my regret.

2453
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,000
I was thinking

2454
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
if I really get this chance,

2455
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,200
what should I say

2456
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,120
on a date?

2457
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,160
Then I was hesitant.

2458
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,880
It won't be ugly.

2459
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,120
Can't we be friends?

2460
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,280
I don't want this result.

2461
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,680
I want to get to know Tae-seo more.

2462
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,200
We didn't get to know him enough.

2463
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,000
So I want to know more about you.

2464
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
I have no regrets knowing you.

2465
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,640
I think this date

2466
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,760
can give more people

2467
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,240
I think we should give others more opportunities.

2468
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,560
to get to know each other more.

2469
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,080
I have no regrets.

2470
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,560
I just think

2471
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,960
Let's go on a date then.

2472
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,360
Do you need it?

2473
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,040
Do any of you want to go?

2474
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,760
Compared to us,

2475
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,720
I think they need more.

2476
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,640
Do you want to go to Xiaoling?

2477
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,440
To be honest, I do.

2478
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,320
even without this chance,

2479
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,800
I also

2480
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,360
talk to each other.

2481
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,520
When I was eating today,

2482
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,080
I said I didn't have the courage.

2483
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,640
But now I think

2484
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,720
whether I have the chance or not,

2485
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,600
I'll talk to him.

2486
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,120
Here you are.

2487
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:53,880
Actually, I've already edited it.

2488
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,000
Me too.

2489
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,680
I've already edited it.

2490
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,120
Yes, me too.

2491
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,760
I'll send it now.

2492
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,240
Come on.

2493
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,120
Come on, Xiao Ling.

2494
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,240
I feel like

2495
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,720
Xiao Ling and Tu need more.

2496
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,000
I may not be able to

2497
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,600
Because this date

2498
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,440
with Terri.

2499
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,840
But I think Xiaoling and Tu

2500
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,640
need to explain the misunderstanding.

2501
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,040
I want to make things clear.

2502
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,280
Otherwise, I'll feel bad.

2503
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,920
There's a text.

2504
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,440
To the boy in the house.

2505
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,360
One of you

2506
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,280
will get a chance to go on a date without regret.

2507
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,960
(Vote)

2508
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,080
in Harry Soup, Thailand.

2509
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,440
who has no regrets.

2510
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,960
Don't vote for yourself.

2511
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,480
Wave.

2512
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,480
and canvass for myself.

2513
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,000
My reason is very clear.

2514
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,880
because

2515
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,680
I can get along with Tata

2516
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,720
in just two days.

2517
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,520
Because after that,

2518
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,840
she went to Japan to do her work.

2519
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,600
I went to England to do my study.

2520
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,400
It's really hard to meet.

2521
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,480
That's the problem that annoys me.

2522
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,680
for over a week.

2523
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,160
I have to go out every night.

2524
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:08,680
Wear short sleeves

2525
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,320
and wear thin clothes.

2526
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,520
I need to go out and calm down.

2527
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,200
I'm annoyed every day.

2528
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:13,800
Look, I'm always embarrassed.

2529
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
That's the reason.

2530
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,120
It's not about anything else.

2531
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:16,320
Yes.

2532
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,880
Bro.

2533
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,480
I vote for you.

2534
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,360
You win. Go.

2535
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,400
Your reason is really...

2536
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,480
I just want to go on this date.

2537
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,320
But I don't think

2538
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,240
I'm the one

2539
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,600
who needs this date the most.

2540
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,880
So,

2541
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,560
Fatty, please vote for the person you need the most.

2542
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,600
Actually,

2543
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,400
I thought about the same soup.

2544
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,120
Because I...

2545
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,680
I...

2546
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,400
I'm not like you.

2547
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,960
I mean, whether it's studying

2548
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,720
Tata and work.

2549
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,600
both sides may not be...

2550
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,200
I think I have many opportunities

2551
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,680
to get close to Hua.

2552
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,840
Actually, I think

2553
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,680
I need this chance.

2554
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,680
Through the soup,

2555
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,240
and what you told me,

2556
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,040
Some details

2557
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,480
For example, he said,

2558
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,400
when Xiaoling

2559
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,000
about love,

2560
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,160
I changed the topic to another place.

2561
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,520
In my impression,

2562
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,120
I may not have

2563
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,240
with her officially.

2564
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,640
No matter what the result will be,

2565
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,120
I think we need to talk to each other.

2566
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,080
OK.

2567
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,960
Let's vote.

2568
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:24,520
OK.

2569
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,040
Let's vote separately.

2570
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,200
I want to go on this date.

2571
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,920
and go out with Susu.

2572
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,840
and get along with her.

2573
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,960
But I think Tu

2574
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,120
needs this date more.

2575
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,440
Even if you don't give me the answer tomorrow,

2576
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,120
at least you'll spend the day together.

2577
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,200
Xiao Ling won't get involved in this.

2578
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,680
Then she can spend one day less.

2579
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,280
Even if we don't have a successful date tomorrow,

2580
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,800
I'll open it tonight.

2581
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,880
House of Feelings.

2582
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,120
to sit down

2583
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,760
to talk about this.

2584
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,840
and talk to Xiaoling.

2585
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:03,800
Otherwise, I think...

2586
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,400
it would be a regret

2587
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,840
it will be a regret in my heart.

2588
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,480
Let's go back.

2589
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,720
Let's go home.

2590
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,280
Let's go home.

2591
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,240
It's cold.

2592
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,400
They're back?

2593
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,600
I don't think so.

2594
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,560
They haven't returned yet.

2595
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,880
This bath is high enough.

2596
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,040
You guys

2597
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,800
You don't talk

2598
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,960
They're all holding it in.

2599
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,240
I'm being considerate.

2600
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,760
I was very sincere.

2601
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,280
It's like

2602
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,000
It makes me

2603
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,280
deep into my heart.

2604
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,440
I even doubt myself.

2605
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,960
Am I really that bad?

2606
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,880
I don't know how to express

2607
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,120
how to express my feelings.

2608
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,840
Am I scary today?

2609
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,880
Actually, it's not scary.

2610
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,640
Maybe you care more about Xiao Ling.

2611
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,760
I'm different from usual.

2612
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,920
Yes, I'm different.

2613
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,360
So Xiaoling talked to you about

2614
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,400
she likes drawing, right?

2615
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,520
She said Tu might be happy

2616
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,200
and she was very happy.

2617
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,520
Then she started to

2618
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,000
Then she found the map and returned.

2619
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,240
No response.

2620
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,400
Got it.

2621
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,920
As your brother,

2622
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,960
I have to say this.

2623
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,080
I have to say it.

2624
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,560
I think you did well.

2625
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,720
Are you back?

2626
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,080
No.

2627
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,200
Is anyone there?

2628
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,000
No.

2629
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,720
Nobody.

2630
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:52,960
The girls are back.

2631
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,000
I want to welcome them.

2632
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,840
But I need some rest.

2633
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,920
When did you come back?

2634
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,360
Five minutes earlier.

2635
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,600
Tom.

2636
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,200
What?

2637
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,560
I want to talk to you.

2638
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:09,920
Go.

2639
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,800
Come out.

2640
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,600
It's wild.

2641
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,880
I want to hear it.

2642
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:13,880
Me too.

2643
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,840
How was your talk?

2644
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,720
Not bad.

2645
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,200
Tell me something I want to know.

2646
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,000
He still doesn't know how he feels.

2647
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,520
Did you talk about this in public?

2648
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,480
or did you ask him yourself?

2649
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,240
It's all public.

2650
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,600
I asked him a lot.

2651
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,720
about you.

2652
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,640
And

2653
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,000
Although

2654
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,600
don't like this kind of behavior,

2655
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,200
But he told the truth.

2656
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,680
He said it too.

2657
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,080
it was him.

2658
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,200
He wasn't sure if he would

2659
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,560
Will he confess his love?

2660
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:54,720
It's yummy.

2661
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,680
I know something today.

2662
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,120
It seems to be Tata.

2663
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,240
accidentally said it.

2664
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,080
Then she said

2665
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,040
when she was an interviewer,

2666
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,360
she thought Harry would want to date her more.

2667
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:03,880
She thinks Tu

2668
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,040
I didn't want to date her that much.

2669
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,200
Then I heard

2670
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,360
what I meant.

2671
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,080
Tu went to interview you, right?

2672
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,320
So I guess

2673
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,360
Is this his first time?

2674
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,240
I think he was looking for a tower.

2675
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,000
But I was rejected.

2676
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,800
and came to me.

2677
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,040
Actually, you are his second choice.

2678
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:18,920
But

2679
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,240
he only knows someone

2680
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,440
to really like someone.

2681
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,400
Maybe.

2682
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,240
But after knowing this today,

2683
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,680
I feel a little awkward.

2684
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,560
But

2685
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,520
Actually,

2686
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,200
I can't make any decision for you.

2687
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,880
But in my opinion,

2688
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,640
he

2689
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,240
doesn't deserve your love.

2690
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,920
I forced Tu

2691
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,840
I asked him too much.

2692
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,600
I kept saying

2693
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,800
I said I didn't think you were sincere enough.

2694
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,480
I said the answer you gave

2695
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,520
is ambiguous.

2696
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,960
So,

2697
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,000
I want you to confirm

2698
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,040
if you don't really like Xiaoling,

2699
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,440
don't do anything

2700
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,720
that will make her misunderstand.

2701
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,840
He was actually quite upset today.

2702
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,600
Because I kept asking

2703
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,200
He kept asking.

2704
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,400
He said he really likes him.

2705
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,400
But from his behavior,

2706
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,360
from his behavior.

2707
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,680
I think the probability

2708
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,160
he didn't think it through.

2709
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,800
No.

2710
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,200
It's okay. I think I know.

2711
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,400
It's okay. Let's go.

2712
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,120
I can do it.

2713
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:55,680
Cry.

2714
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:56,880
If I can't hold on,

2715
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,320
I'll ask you to cry.

2716
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,800
I'm here crying with you.

2717
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,800
Why don't you cry with me?

2718
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,120
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

2719
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,200
Cry.

2720
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,920
Don't cry for nothing.

2721
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,840
Don't cry.

2722
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,480
I don't want to go down later.

2723
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,640
It's okay. I know.

2724
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:07,440
Are you really okay?

2725
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,320
I'm fine.

2726
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
I'll call you if I need anything.

2727
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,400
Okay.

2728
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,600
Remember to call me.

2729
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,680
What did you talk about?

2730
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,760
Nothing.

2731
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,560
I'll talk to you later.

2732
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,720
Actually, I asked him many questions.

2733
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,200
about many questions.

2734
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,720
I also asked about long-distance relationship.

2735
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,840
how to solve the quarrel.

2736
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,400
Actually, I'm not asking him.

2737
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,120
I'm trying to give him a hint.

2738
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,880
What about long-distance relationship?

2739
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,880
What did he say?

2740
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,070
Then I said,

2741
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:41,310
you went to talk to someone.

2742
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:42,640
No problem. It's a good thing.

2743
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,360
But...

2744
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,640
The problem is when you take the initiative,

2745
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,400
can you express

2746
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,640
Can you express your feelings

2747
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,350
or if you can feel their feelings.

2748
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,520
Is it quantity or quality?

2749
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,080
Your ten-minute quality chat

2750
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,400
is much better than

2751
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,040
than one hour.

2752
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:57,630
What does he think about long-distance relationship?

2753
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:58,640
It's either a long distance or...

2754
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,240
Because he's busy.

2755
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:00,920
He's busy.

2756
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,840
I know.

2757
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,880
He said he would

2758
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,600
come to you

2759
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,040
or go out with you.

2760
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,360
No.

2761
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,960
But he doesn't like my type.

2762
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,680
I asked him.

2763
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,230
He said he likes cool girls.

2764
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,560
and handsome.

2765
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:12,960
Then he said,

2766
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,680
he found that cute girls

2767
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,760
is a very good choice.

2768
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,040
But I still care.

2769
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,600
He doesn't like my type.

2770
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,080
He's changed now. He said...

2771
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,560
And soup fell in love with you at first sight.

2772
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,640
He said he would confess to you.

2773
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,440
Confess?

2774
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,600
He only told me that he wanted to do one thing.

2775
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,400
But it's a bit difficult.

2776
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,000
He can't do it.

2777
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,440
You have to see.

2778
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,440
What is it?

2779
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,400
I won't tell you.

2780
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,390
Fine.

2781
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,280
Anything else?

2782
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,240
Nothing.

2783
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:37,950
What did he say?

2784
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,710
He went to training.

2785
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:40,350
Did he tell you

2786
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,200
Tell me if you did.

2787
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,640
If they fight, they'll come to you.

2788
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,710
Is he going to

2789
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:44,880
training soon?

2790
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,950
He said he won't

2791
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,000
Maybe next time.

2792
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,480
They need to train for a long time.

2793
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,950
Two or three months.

2794
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,680
I'm just like Tata.

2795
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,990
I can't have a long-distance relationship.

2796
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,200
I don't think I have.

2797
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,040
Me too.

2798
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,560
We're doomed.

2799
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,720
I need to meet.

2800
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,960
To be honest, you two are useless.

2801
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,440
I need to meet him.

2802
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,760
I don't feel safe either.

2803
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,790
It's not that I don't feel insecure.

2804
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,640
I don't feel

2805
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:04,760
I don't feel that deep.

2806
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,000
Yes, what should I do?

2807
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,080
Without feelings, I...

2808
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,160
I'm fine.

2809
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,480
I will hint myself.

2810
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,880
I think they'll do the same.

2811
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,160
If we haven't seen each other for a long time...

2812
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,480
Yes.

2813
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,400
It feels strange to meet suddenly.

2814
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,160
I feel awkward.

2815
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:18,910
Shy.

2816
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:19,440
Yes.

2817
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:22,640
It's awkward.

2818
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,120
Borderline.

2819
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,000
Yes.

2820
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,470
Don't you recognize me?

2821
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:30,080
It's just a little awkward.

2822
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,870
I feel like this after a long time.

2823
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,360
I feel embarrassed.

2824
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:33,680
It's okay.

2825
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,750
I think

2826
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,480
Just take it step by step.

2827
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:36,990
Okay.

2828
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,040
Tu, why are you unhappy?

2829
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:48,080
I seldom see you so weak.

2830
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,440
I also think Tu Tu is very low tonight.

2831
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,670
No, I'm sleepy.

2832
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:53,790
I'm a little tired

2833
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,230
After the soup,

2834
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:57,280
the metabolism will be faster.

2835
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,230
When I came back,

2836
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:12,600
I noticed that he was in a bad mood.

2837
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,040
I was thinking

2838
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,200
if I should talk to him.

2839
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,110
I wanted to keep an eye on him,

2840
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,160
But I found I couldn't sit down.

2841
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,160
I really feel uneasy.

2842
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,590
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

2843
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,600
Let's go.

2844
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,390
Shall we talk upstairs?

2845
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:47,870
Okay.

2846
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,150
Let's go.

2847
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,120
Let me see if it's warm.

2848
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,400
Not bad.

2849
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,640
Have a seat.

2850
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:59,960
I know the soup.

2851
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,400
might have asked some sharp questions.

2852
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:02,960
I know.

2853
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,120
But I understand.

2854
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,360
I don't know how to talk to you.

2855
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,590
Me too. I'm confused.

2856
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:10,960
You know?

2857
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,640
Well,

2858
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,600
I think

2859
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,840
too sharp.

2860
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,880
But I can understand.

2861
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,680
But I...

2862
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,870
I remember one thing.

2863
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:24,800
I also asked Hua.

2864
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,400
I said,

2865
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,840
Xiaoling, you have the chance

2866
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,150
to change a man.

2867
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:30,400
Did you come in the end?

2868
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,350
But the first thing you said when you got in the car was...

2869
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,470
If I knew this was the reward,

2870
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:34,200
I wouldn't have taken it.

2871
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,680
The map.

2872
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,120
Did you think it was me?

2873
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,000
You want to win

2874
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,760
just to have this privilege, right?

2875
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,600
Do you know the map?

2876
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:41,950
No.

2877
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,280
If I knew it was a reward like this,

2878
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,510
I don't want to win.

2879
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,320
This one.

2880
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,030
At that time,

2881
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:52,960
I was quite happy.

2882
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,270
But when I heard that, I...

2883
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,280
Can you stop for a while?

2884
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,560
Why did I say that?

2885
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,160
Because when I got in the car,

2886
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,440
I said this to relieve the embarrassment.

2887
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,350
Too much information difference.

2888
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,470
The night before yesterday,

2889
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,960
when I got the news,

2890
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,920
I was still in Xin and Hua's room.

2891
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,200
Fatty was there too.

2892
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,390
We were thinking

2893
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:12,320
if I should change.

2894
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,310
Because I think it's reasonable

2895
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:14,360
with flowers.

2896
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,720
After I proposed it,

2897
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,880
Xinxin was worried

2898
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,680
Between the two teams,

2899
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,680
she was very upset as a third wheel.

2900
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,040
But then I thought about it.

2901
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,040
I think I should be selfish for once.

2902
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,840
I chose to change.

2903
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,480
I definitely want to team up with you.

2904
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,000
The next morning,

2905
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,960
you could see me coming here.

2906
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,880
At that time,

2907
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,520
why I said that in the car.

2908
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,640
I just want to calm down

2909
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,640
Awkward.

2910
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:36,990
Then...

2911
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,790
So you didn't realize

2912
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:39,230
the three of us walked together.

2913
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,880
I didn't say I wanted to go with you alone.

2914
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,200
Fragrant juice wine.

2915
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,720
It's because of this

2916
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,070
Yes.

2917
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,080
I don't know

2918
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,080
Xiao Ling, what happened between you two.

2919
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,600
Xiaoling, I heard that.

2920
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,000
Then I...

2921
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,440
Yeah.

2922
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,560
Fragrant juice wine.

2923
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,120
Yes.

2924
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,600
The wine.
You know?

2925
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,040
Alright.

2926
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,240
Club wine.
Let me tell you now.

2927
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,840
Did you know the soup today?

2928
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,720
He...

2929
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,680
Because I know

2930
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,000
there must be some misunderstanding

2931
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,120
and you talked to him,

2932
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,240
That's why he asked these questions.

2933
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,120
I know there's a premise,

2934
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,280
but when he asked those questions,

2935
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,480
Tu, juice wine, even in the hot spring,

2936
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,960
I always bring some trembling juice wine.

2937
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,630
Advantaged juice wine.

2938
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:12,400
It's really too sharp.

2939
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,750
Including the secret mirror house.

2940
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,190
Xiao Ling, what Mirror House?

2941
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:18,160
Speaking of Mirror House, I'll explain.

2942
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,760
Didn't you say you didn't know it until today?

2943
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,880
you were

2944
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:21,400
Juice wine.

2945
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:21,790
Right?

2946
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:22,320
Fragrant juice wine.

2947
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:22,560
The map, fruit juice wine. It's like this.

2948
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,160
Here's the thing.

2949
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,320
The Mirror Room...

2950
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,470
Do you remember?

2951
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,880
At that time,

2952
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,800
on the night of snow exercise.

2953
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,150
Right?

2954
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:30,840
Because before,

2955
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,840
there was nothing between us.

2956
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,070
Like that, right?

2957
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:37,080
So first of all,

2958
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,720
since I'm in contact with Tata today,

2959
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,710
I will

2960
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:40,440
fill in the pagoda first.

2961
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,840
I said, "Then fill the tower."

2962
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,000
And then...

2963
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,440
I was curious about you

2964
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,840
I was curious about you.

2965
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,670
At the beginning,

2966
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:51,120
a girl

2967
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,030
a boring girl.

2968
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:52,960
But I think after having fun,

2969
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,750
I thought she was a very cheerful girl.

2970
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,790
I kept this.

2971
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:58,360
At the end,

2972
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,550
every day.

2973
01:35:59,550 --> 01:35:59,960
Juice wine.

2974
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,040
The picture of juice is verifying it.

2975
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,750
I can feel it at the end.

2976
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,320
I think you and I

2977
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,280
I think you and I

2978
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:06,840
are kind of

2979
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,960
whether it's about hobbies or life,

2980
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,470
we think we are quite optimistic.

2981
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:14,000
Juice wine.

2982
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,070
That's why I chose

2983
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:16,920
The map means I want to know you,

2984
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,080
instead of

2985
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,000
I was rejected.

2986
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,960
and then choose you.

2987
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,400
That's not what it means.

2988
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,480
When the soup asked me,

2989
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,640
I was

2990
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,560
a little awkward.

2991
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,910
I never mentioned it before.

2992
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,960
Actually, I accidentally

2993
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,080
Tata accidentally slipped out.

2994
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,840
I found out.

2995
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:33,150
But when I think about it,

2996
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,960
In my memory,

2997
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,640
Xiaoling, as long as I send it to you,

2998
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,720
you will come back.

2999
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:39,000
Yes.
HAVE GRASZH

3000
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,800
HAVE.
Yes.

3001
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:46,720
Are you busy?

3002
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,320
No.

3003
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:49,280
I want to play with you.

3004
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,230
What kind of flower do you like?

3005
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,400
Rose. Any color.

3006
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,440
You can spray it.

3007
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,280
It's spraying

3008
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,120
There's paint on the flowers.

3009
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,560
The color is different, right?

3010
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,160
Yes.

3011
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,280
I thought of another flower.

3012
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,030
But now I can't think of

3013
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,120
what the flower is called.

3014
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,430
It has a good meaning.

3015
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,560
Orange flower. There are several ways to call it.

3016
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,360
I like peony too.

3017
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,520
Shaoyao is pretty too.

3018
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,280
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

3019
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,960
Where are you going after the recording?

3020
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:24,990
Home.

3021
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,200
What about New Year?

3022
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,080
Beijing.

3023
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,550
Are you going to train

3024
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,120
after you leave here?

3025
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,480
My mom will be in Zhejiang after New Year.

3026
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,400
She took my brother to the training camp.

3027
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:40,440
So,

3028
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,200
I won't spend the Spring Festival in Beijing, right?

3029
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,200
Then you won't spend the Spring Festival at home?

3030
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,200
Not necessarily.

3031
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,990
I have to ask my mom what she said.

3032
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:50,640
It's so sad not to celebrate Chinese New Year at home.

3033
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,640
Is the festival atmosphere very strong?

3034
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,880
I have a lot of people to eat together.

3035
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,280
I have a lot of family members.

3036
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,000
Is anyone home? Go back.

3037
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,790
Mommy is here, and my brother is here.

3038
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,070
Dad should be here too.

3039
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:03,920
Also,

3040
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,080
Qiyue.

3041
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,400
Hello.

3042
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,320
July, May, bye. Hello.

3043
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,190
Che Che, Pu Girl, Mimi.

3044
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,430
There's another one.

3045
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,040
Let me think.

3046
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,600
My brain is falling.

3047
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,430
Sticky.

3048
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:27,390
Sticky.

3049
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,480
I seem to forget it every time.

3050
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,880
You don't remember

3051
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,320
Which year?

3052
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:34,840
New Year's Eve.

3053
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,760
Sticky New Year

3054
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,310
Chinese New Year is fine too.

3055
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:39,390
I thought we could have more than one year.

3056
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:40,400
Yeah.

3057
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,720
It's quite profound. When you name it,

3058
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,550
Modern poet.

3059
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,190
Yes.

3060
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,150
Susu.

3061
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:50,400
What a poet.

3062
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,200
Don't you think the texts I sent

3063
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:51,920
are meaningful?

3064
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,000
Yes.

3065
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,680
Do you know

3066
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,600
I sent you that day?

3067
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,520
You didn't

3068
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,000
you didn't discuss with me.

3069
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,960
Do you know

3070
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,240
what I mean?

3071
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,600
A overflowing soup bun.

3072
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,000
Do you know what it means?

3073
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,480
You didn't search.

3074
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,760
This one too.

3075
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,560
I thought it was just that photo.

3076
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,160
No.

3077
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,560
Every word I say is meaningful.

3078
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,640
I'm a person with a deep meaning.

3079
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:18,240
I'll go back and study later.

3080
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,630
I think I can find it.

3081
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,280
I adapted it.

3082
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,080
Many are adapted.

3083
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,560
Where should I search?

3084
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,870
Happiness is

3085
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,720
It didn't explain

3086
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,440
It told me

3087
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,160
no need to explain.

3088
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,840
Because this is the original sentence.

3089
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,320
Do you know the last one?

3090
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,880
We sat on rocks to see the sea.

3091
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,080
Do you know this?

3092
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,800
Maybe we'll fall in love with each other.

3093
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,190
Isn't that good?

3094
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:06,400
I think I'm good at it.

3095
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,150
OK.

3096
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:20,600
Yes, I heard from Mimi today

3097
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,270
your type is

3098
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:23,800
Very handsome and cool.

3099
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,640
In the past,

3100
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:30,520
I had two extremes.

3101
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,920
or

3102
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,640
So handsome.

3103
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,110
or very cute.

3104
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,160
Okay.

3105
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,360
It's like I don't like thick face.

3106
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,760
Never.

3107
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,600
My heart aches.

3108
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,990
I guess I'm going to fail.

3109
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,000
And today,

3110
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,280
I said something very funny.

3111
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,040
Didn't I

3112
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,760
for a long time in England?

3113
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,480
My friend asked me

3114
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,320
if you had contact with foreigners.

3115
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
I said I think they all look the same.

3116
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,600
I don't think anyone is handsome.

3117
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,750
I just like Chinese.

3118
01:40:58,750 --> 01:40:59,520
I don't like foreigners.

3119
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,920
I have no feelings for foreigners.

3120
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,720
Oh no, you have no feelings for me.

3121
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,390
No.

3122
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:04,440
Then Mimi said,

3123
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,160
OK. When you come back, you can meet

3124
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,720
You can't move your fingers.

3125
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,760
You can't help either.

3126
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,040
Who wants to help?

3127
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,440
You can't move your finger.

3128
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,520
You foul again.

3129
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,310
One, two, three.

3130
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,360
I'll let you win.

3131
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:32,440
Thank you.

3132
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,790
You're quite generous.

3133
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:35,040
You're welcome.

3134
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,080
I heard that one day she cried for you.

3135
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,120
Why don't I know anything?

3136
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,000
I feel like

3137
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,720
I've crossed paths with this world.

3138
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,160
Then I asked why.

3139
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,400
Then they said I should ask myself.

3140
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,880
I said,

3141
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,720
Me again.

3142
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:50,160
When will you talk?

3143
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:50,750
I don't know.

3144
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,520
when she was comforting me.

3145
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,990
When?

3146
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,400
The day we went to the cat café.

3147
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,160
When did you talk?

3148
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,800
When I was sleeping.

3149
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,720
I think so.

3150
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,640
What did you say?

3151
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,950
I made her cry.

3152
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:06,960
Scold me?

3153
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,440
No.

3154
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:07,960
Me?

3155
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,440
I forgot.

3156
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,470
Liar.

3157
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:10,910
You swear you forgot.

3158
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,470
I swear "four".

3159
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,960
Swear.

3160
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,920
I swear.

3161
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:17,920
I forgot.

3162
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,390
My soup.

3163
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,590
I'm so curious.

3164
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:24,440
Did you synchronize the rest with her?

3165
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,000
Yes.

3166
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,120
Why did you cry because of me that day?

3167
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,080
How did you know?

3168
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,840
She said it.

3169
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,640
She said it.

3170
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,400
Yes, otherwise how would I know

3171
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,920
She cares about me.

3172
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,520
When I shared with her,

3173
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,400
she

3174
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,640
feel sad for me.

3175
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,510
And

3176
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:49,200
she might want to

3177
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,480
to suppress her emotions.

3178
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,160
She went out for a walk.

3179
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,040
She cried when she came back from a walk.

3180
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,960
But...

3181
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,520
I was confused.

3182
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:01,240
My mind

3183
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,320
in my mind.

3184
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,280
Then I was a little dull.

3185
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,080
I didn't hug her in the first second.

3186
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,910
Then I felt guilty.

3187
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,830
I don't know why I said

3188
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:14,840
I didn't hug her right away.

3189
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:15,920
I felt very sad.

3190
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,920
I think

3191
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,080
I shouldn't be like this.

3192
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:19,870
I don't want to be like that either.

3193
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:22,080
I'll apologize to her here.

3194
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,840
She didn't care at all.

3195
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:24,880
So at that time,

3196
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,040
I might realize

3197
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,350
I should cherish

3198
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,950
when I get along with you.

3199
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,160
I cried.

3200
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,070
And Su Zihao kept going.

3201
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:36,480
He even flipped my quilt.

3202
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,790
I'm speechless.

3203
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,960
Are you sleeping?

3204
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,710
Are you crying?

3205
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,280
He's asleep.

3206
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,720
After he saw you,

3207
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,800
he came to me.

3208
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,000
He said, "What's wrong with you?"

3209
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,280
I said, "What's wrong with me again?"

3210
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,480
What's wrong with the soup?

3211
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,480
Come and take a look.

3212
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,110
Is the soup asleep or crying?

3213
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:04,240
We cricketed you loudly at the door.

3214
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,320
She also said

3215
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,470
Stop it, I beg you.

3216
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,520
You're so talkative.

3217
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,270
What are you talking about?

3218
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,640
It's so funny.

3219
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,320
She will reveal

3220
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,520
everything about you.

3221
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,040
You can't contact each other anymore.

3222
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,710
I haven't seen Su Zihao cry.

3223
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,520
When can he cry?

3224
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,030
He might cry when he confesses.

3225
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,630
because he's under a lot of pressure.

3226
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:38,080
I think so too.

3227
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,680
Because he's going abroad.

3228
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,640
He's far away.

3229
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,280
Yes.

3230
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,840
Tata is going to Japan too.

3231
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,040
He was worried too.

3232
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,550
They also talked about the reality.

3233
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,110
Yes.

3234
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:55,230
Why did you ask me

3235
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:56,830
about long-distance relationship?

3236
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,640
You want to go to England for postgraduate studies?

3237
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,680
I'm not going to England for postgraduate studies.

3238
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,800
But I think you're busy too.

3239
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,360
It's not a long-distance relationship. It's like a long-distance relationship.

3240
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,120
Are you busy?

3241
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,440
I'm fine.

3242
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,280
When I'm not busy,

3243
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,720
when I'm not busy.

3244
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,240
I think you can

3245
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,680
do what I do with me,

3246
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,440
Or I can be with you

3247
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,080
with you.

3248
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:20,990
But you're busy.

3249
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:22,840
Didn't you say you were busy (flying around)?

3250
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,400
So my concern is

3251
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,710
I think you'll be very busy.

3252
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,710
How many times do you think

3253
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,200
a week?

3254
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,320
I never thought

3255
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,080
Three or four times.

3256
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:41,040
Almost. We'll be busy when we're busy.

3257
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,320
But I can't accept

3258
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,000
a foreign land.

3259
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,270
I think I'll die.

3260
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:46,910
Indeed.

3261
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:47,360
Yes.

3262
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,000
Because after I fall in love,

3263
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,150
I'll be clingy.

3264
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:51,440
But I can't see you every day.

3265
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,720
Every day?

3266
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,640
It's too annoying.

3267
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,150
We'll find each other's shortcomings.

3268
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:57,880
Yes.

3269
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,030
But I can't accept

3270
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,600
Long time no see.

3271
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,600
Let me check the class schedule.

3272
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,520
three or four times should be fine.

3273
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:10,960
Both of us

3274
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,400
are clear now.

3275
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,560
It's just a confession.

3276
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,080
I've learned how to express myself

3277
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,230
I've learned to express myself.

3278
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:20,160
and take the initiative.

3279
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,920
I'll prepare for my confession.

3280
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,440
Let's go.

3281
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,560
Okay.

3282
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:56,830
Wait.

3283
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,360
Do you see Tom's nose?

3284
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,840
What's wrong with him?

3285
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,000
Did you see his nose?

3286
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,080
Your nose?

3287
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,520
handsome?

3288
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:13,360
Why is it swollen?

3289
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,640
"aesthetics".

3290
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:17,280
I knocked yesterday.

3291
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:17,880
Nothing.

3292
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,880
Where did you hurt?

3293
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:21,680
On the floor.

3294
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,280
The rope is hooked by the suitcase.

3295
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,520
What?

3296
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,240
Are you still alive?

3297
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,670
My nose is bleeding.

3298
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:42,000
It's bleeding.

3299
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,520
Don't let it spill.

3300
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,950
Get ice. I'll wrap your face with a towel.

3301
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:46,800
Apply it.

3302
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,400
He went to the hospital last night.

3303
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,200
He might have a fracture.

3304
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:56,640
But the left side is a bit dented.

3305
01:47:59,070 --> 01:47:59,600
It should be fine.

3306
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,240
It's nothing serious. The doctor said

3307
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:03,480
he'll recover for a week.

3308
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:12,480
What time did you sleep?

3309
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:13,880
Six.

3310
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,240
You sleep for four hours.

3311
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,200
Go back to sleep.

3312
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,440
I have to go out today.

3313
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,190
Don't go out.

3314
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:23,960
What?

3315
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,670
Stop.

3316
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,600
Why didn't you tell me?

3317
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,430
When I knew about this,

3318
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:35,070
my first thought was

3319
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:36,560
why didn't you tell me?

3320
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,800
I hope when something happens to him,

3321
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,160
or when he encounters problems,

3322
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,400
when he encounters problems.

3323
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,830
No matter the problem he has,

3324
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:45,950
or not,

3325
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:46,910
As long as something happens to him,

3326
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:48,830
I definitely want to be the first

3327
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:50,080
stand behind him.

3328
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,880
So,

3329
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:53,840
tell me next time.

3330
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,280
I'll get angry if you don't tell me.

3331
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,000
She

3332
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,360
worried about me.

3333
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,110
She asked me

3334
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,400
I've never stopped caring about you.

3335
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,390
I'm used to it since childhood.

3336
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,920
But I have to prepare something for Susu.

3337
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,560
So I'm leaving.

3338
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,280
Bye.

3339
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:27,960
Are you leaving?

3340
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,800
Yes.

3341
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,520
Wait for me.

3342
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,750
Wait for me.

3343
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,320
I'm leaving.

3344
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:45,150
Tell her before you go out.

3345
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,360
The nose of soup.

3346
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,190
Last night at 3 a.m.,

3347
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,440
his pants were stuck in the wheel of the suitcase.

3348
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,240
And then...

3349
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:57,950
I didn't wear glasses.

3350
01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:59,280
I took a look. I couldn't see.

3351
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,000
Then I went over.

3352
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,320
Let me see.

3353
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,360
What's wrong with you?

3354
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,240
He said he fell.

3355
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:06,880
Are you bleeding?

3356
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,360
He said you're bleeding.

3357
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,710
And I...

3358
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,480
You're bleeding.

3359
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:08,720
Yes.

3360
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,270
A nosebleed.

3361
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,710
Then I flew down

3362
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:12,720
like lightning.

3363
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,590
I'll get the medical kit later.

3364
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:18,840
and fly up with a medical kit.

3365
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,680
I heard they went to the hospital in the middle of the night.

3366
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:24,720
My nose is swollen.

3367
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,640
You don't know.

3368
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:27,960
He left.

3369
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,760
Soft tissue injury or

3370
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,200
and the fine blood vessels are ruptured.

3371
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:31,960
But it's not a big problem.

3372
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,670
It should be fine.

3373
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,200
Don't worry.

3374
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,320
Okay, that's good.

3375
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,750
3 or 4 a.m.

3376
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,440
I went to the emergency room.

3377
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:49,880
I didn't sleep much.

3378
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,120
Then my nose got hurt.

3379
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,630
I feel a little sad.

3380
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:59,070
Poor guy.

3381
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:00,280
His nose is high.

3382
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,600
After the fall, your nose will be...

3383
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,750
Poor and unlucky.

3384
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,720
Dating.

3385
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,960
Let me throw the trash out for you.

3386
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:15,710
How about this?

3387
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:16,640
Thank you.

3388
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:22,270
Give me a hug.

3389
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,320
This one.

3390
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:25,790
Okay.

3391
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:26,880
It's over.

3392
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,040
I'll carry it for you.

3393
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,320
I told you to hold it up.

3394
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,440
Come on.

3395
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,560
Good.

3396
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,470
This photo of you

3397
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:46,640
is really dark.

3398
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,640
Yes.

3399
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,480
Let me take another photo for you.

3400
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:48,960
Okay.

3401
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,110
Put it with mine.

3402
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:50,720
with mine.

3403
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:55,960
I look fair.

3404
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,440
Alright.

3405
01:51:57,470 --> 01:51:59,390
Don't you know that?

3406
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,800
And it's glowing.

3407
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,280
Why do you always like filming these?

3408
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,830
I'm speechless.

3409
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:14,270
Have a seat.

3410
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:17,040
Don't be nervous and flustered here.

3411
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,550
Press your head into the dishwasher.

3412
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:20,280
Let me tell you.

3413
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,080
If you keep doing this,

3414
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,680
You know there's a traffic jam.

3415
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,920
Aren't you going to drive back?

3416
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,110
It's okay.

3417
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:43,520
It's okay to go south.

3418
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,640
When I go home every Chinese New Year,

3419
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,600
I don't have a traffic jam.

3420
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,680
But if we go north,

3421
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,520
from Shanghai to Jiangsu,

3422
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,430
to Shandong.

3423
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:51,280
There's a traffic jam.

3424
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,360
You need to be

3425
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,430
in your place.

3426
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:55,160
Is it possible that

3427
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,960
in the village?

3428
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,720
Be careful of being cricketed.

3429
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,720
They won't cricket me.

3430
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,720
The only thing they can cricket me

3431
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,920
is that I'm not married

3432
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,110
I'm not married yet.

3433
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:18,800
Let's play five-piece chess.

3434
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,520
Do you want to play?

3435
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,400
Do you think I'm thinking?

3436
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,070
I know I'm going to win.

3437
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,750
Really?

3438
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,630
If you win,

3439
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:39,040
What if you lose?

3440
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,040
Wait.

3441
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:42,720
What if you lose?

3442
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,760
I will definitely win.

3443
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,510
What if you lose?

3444
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:47,040
Wait.

3445
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:47,960
What if you lose?

3446
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,510
Wait.

3447
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:49,470
Let me ask you a question first.

3448
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:50,400
If you take the next step,

3449
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:50,960
you'll win?

3450
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,550
No.

3451
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:54,520
Really.

3452
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,760
Will we win the next step?

3453
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,400
Guess.

3454
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,720
You'll win first, right?

3455
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,280
I will win.

3456
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,400
I won two requirements.

3457
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,200
OK.

3458
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:01,760
I lost.

3459
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,560
You lost a request.

3460
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,440
Okay.

3461
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,830
Wait.

3462
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:05,630
I haven't decided yet.

3463
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,320
Wait.

3464
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:10,270
No.

3465
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:10,910
I really didn't see it.

3466
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:11,600
Look at me.

3467
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,190
Look.

3468
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:13,280
Is it?

3469
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,400
Bobo, do you want some water?

3470
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,960
I can’t be so peaceful now.

3471
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,560
Listen.

3472
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,720
Wait for me.

3473
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,320
Go ahead.

3474
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,040
I'll remember it forever.

3475
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:21,880
I'll remember it first.

3476
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,080
Actually,

3477
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,520
I want to agree to your request.

3478
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,840
No.

3479
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,840
It's a bit...

3480
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,160
I'm pretending.

3481
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
I'm pretending.

3482
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:43,520
Can you give me two pieces?

3483
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:44,990
What?

3484
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,480
What are you laughing at?

3485
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,310
I didn't win.

3486
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,520
I can play six-piece chess for you.

3487
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,190
I didn't win.

3488
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:00,830
Wait.

3489
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:01,840
Why didn't you win?

3490
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:02,910
I didn't win.

3491
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:04,190
I'll play six-piece chess for you.

3492
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,240
Are you gambling?

3493
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:06,880
I'm speechless.

3494
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,960
I can't refuse.

3495
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,670
No.

3496
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,150
Yinbo,

3497
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,040
Do you think you are handsome?

3498
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:10,750
I think you're super handsome.

3499
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:11,870
I think I'm ugly.

3500
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:13,630
Do you admit that you're smarter than me?

3501
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,200
I don't.

3502
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,070
I think you're smarter.

3503
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,960
Coming.

3504
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,200
This is the cake. I ordered it.

3505
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,040
What would you like to drink?

3506
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,310
I have swallow wheat milk

3507
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:55,120
and thick coconut milk.

3508
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:55,920
Coke.

3509
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,360
Choose one of these.

3510
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,190
Because you can't drink coffee.

3511
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:01,760
Do you remember?

3512
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,280
Of course.

3513
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,600
Help me choose.

3514
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,520
Okay, she's got swallow wheat milk.

3515
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:06,560
And I want thick coconut milk.

3516
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,120
Swallow wheat milk is hot

3517
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,870
Eat.

3518
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,070
Let's eat first.

3519
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:16,160
Have you had breakfast?

3520
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,440
No.

3521
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,520
I didn't have breakfast either.

3522
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:19,440
You didn't eat either.

3523
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,560
We're almost the same.

3524
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,520
Now I want to open it at the beginning.

3525
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,440
What?

3526
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,600
Not enough

3527
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,440
Open it again.

3528
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:33,400
Cool.

3529
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:33,920
Here.

3530
01:56:36,350 --> 01:56:37,400
I still have some questions

3531
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,280
I still have some questions.

3532
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,360
And I want to

3533
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,200
I want to solve these regrets

3534
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,190
I'll get rid of them.

3535
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,240
If I hadn't found out by accident,

3536
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,360
what Tata said,

3537
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,560
will you tell me?

3538
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:54,720
Here's the thing.

3539
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,600
That day,

3540
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,950
First of all, I think

3541
01:56:57,950 --> 01:56:58,910
is not

3542
01:56:58,910 --> 01:57:00,280
that I need to hide.

3543
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,360
But after the snow exercise that day,

3544
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,360
I had the most contact with her.

3545
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,560
I chose her first.

3546
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,120
Yes.

3547
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,280
But it doesn't mean

3548
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,360
That's right.

3549
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,680
That's not what I meant.

3550
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:15,230
From her perspective, I chose her first.

3551
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:17,950
and got this chance through the interview.

3552
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:20,190
But I may say

3553
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:20,880
I passed the interview.

3554
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,430
I'm happy to find you.

3555
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:23,840
So I think

3556
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,790
this is not a conflict.

3557
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:27,200
I think both of them

3558
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,920
for each other.

3559
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,320
I want to ask you a question.

3560
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:32,760
Go ahead.

3561
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,960
When did you start

3562
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,400
you want to

3563
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,720
you want to get to know me more.

3564
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,910
or get to know more about me.

3565
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:41,440
Or you just wanted to

3566
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,880
to contact me or something.

3567
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,680
Actually on the first day,

3568
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,440
I was chatting with Soup in the siblings' house.

3569
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,440
I said I wanted to meet you.

3570
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:53,150
And then again,

3571
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:55,710
when you're out of control.

3572
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:57,630
When we were skiing,

3573
01:57:57,630 --> 01:57:59,960
when we were skiing?

3574
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,000
Then I talked to you later.

3575
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,280
You said I was interviewed.

3576
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,320
Are you happy?

3577
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:05,720
Let me tell you.

3578
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:07,600
I was interviewed anyway.

3579
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,400
Are you happy?

3580
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:14,040
I think saying this to me

3581
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:14,720
will

3582
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,600
attract my attention and interest.

3583
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:20,080
Now I know

3584
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,720
you said that casually.

3585
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,160
If you said it on purpose,

3586
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:28,440
it would be

3587
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,950
too meticulous.

3588
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,040
I was interviewed today.

3589
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,000
Are you happy?

3590
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,920
I remember this very clearly.

3591
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,800
There was a change of thought.

3592
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,510
When we were in the hot spring yesterday,

3593
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:45,880
I have a question.

3594
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,960
whether you want to develop friendship

3595
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,920
or love?

3596
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,040
You said you don't know

3597
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,400
I already have the answer in my heart.

3598
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,680
Because after talking to you,

3599
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:58,840
Including the days

3600
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,190
the days I spent with you

3601
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,720
and why I

3602
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,710
with you.

3603
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:05,240
I think that's love.

3604
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:06,560
Okay.

3605
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,000
I have another question.

3606
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,640
When did you

3607
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,080
interested in me?

3608
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,350
From

3609
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:18,520
It's mainly because we're getting along.

3610
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:19,360
And I'll talk more

3611
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,830
with you.

3612
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,640
I feel like

3613
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:25,040
a normal conversation.

3614
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,200
So there's nothing

3615
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:28,440
or movements.

3616
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:30,240
One step at a time, right?

3617
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:31,550
OK.

3618
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,240
Actually, I'm a combination of two.

3619
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,240
but I prefer love.

3620
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,600
I can actually hit you more.

3621
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:42,270
Go ahead.

3622
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,320
From zero to ten.

3623
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,040
If zero means no feeling,

3624
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,120
I like it.

3625
01:59:48,510 --> 01:59:49,310
What about you?

3626
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,200
9.5.

3627
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,480
Are you that interested in me?

3628
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:59,360
Why didn't I feel it?

3629
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,630
To be honest, I was surprised.

3630
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:02,430
Because I think

3631
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:04,400
this is a very high score.

3632
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,720
He has reached 9.5.

3633
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,200
Almost full marks.

3634
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:07,680
Here's the thing.

3635
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,670
Because I think...

3636
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,320
If I get one,

3637
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,920
like six points,

3638
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,110
I must be

3639
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:15,440
feel sorry for my heart.

3640
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,350
I think

3641
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:17,920
I must have feelings for you

3642
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,230
because I like you.

3643
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:21,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

3644
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,390
interact with you

3645
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:24,120
or something like that.

3646
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,200
Actually, I want to know someone.

3647
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,230
I'm not saying

3648
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:29,950
I want to keep getting to know her.

3649
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:31,870
I tend to

3650
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:33,560
and observe slowly.

3651
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:35,960
Interesting.

3652
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,640
So you have nothing

3653
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,480
ask me more?

3654
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,880
From my perspective,

3655
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:57,720
there is no problem at all.

3656
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:00,030
and the questions I want to ask you.

3657
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:00,670
I don't have any.

3658
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:02,000
Because I think

3659
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,200
you're not curious

3660
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:04,800
how much I have for you?

3661
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,270
Let me ask you another question.

3662
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,720
How many points will you give me?

3663
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,030
0 to 100. You need to be so detailed.

3664
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,080
Let me think.

3665
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,720
90.

3666
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:22,840
To be honest,

3667
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,320
I can't give him such a high score.

3668
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,160
But I do have feelings for him now.

3669
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:27,200
and interested in him.

3670
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,680
I don't think it's too low.

3671
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm not honest with myself.

3672
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,640
Then why is it 90?

3673
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:34,320
Because before,

3674
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,830
I found that we are similar at this point.

3675
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:37,950
There's no way

3676
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:39,870
in the world.

3677
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:41,280
So this is the best answer

3678
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,160
I can give.

3679
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,870
After listening to you,

3680
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:46,160
I think we are quite similar.

3681
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,040
I had a plan for my ideal type.

3682
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,200
I said he must be tall.

3683
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,440
And he must be...

3684
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,870
Anyway, we're talking about this.

3685
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:56,440
I said

3686
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,430
I said the person I'm in contact with now is Tu.

3687
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:00,480
He's not

3688
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,520
my traditional ideal type.

3689
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:03,840
So later they asked me

3690
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,040
if I had an ideal type.

3691
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,640
I said it depends on the feeling.

3692
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,040
Well,

3693
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,240
because you showed up.

3694
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:15,390
I heard that two people are very similar

3695
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:19,120
to get along with.

3696
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,720
But I think we are the opposite.

3697
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,840
Because I think two people who are very similar

3698
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,680
He can understand

3699
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:28,240
his feelings

3700
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:29,440
can

3701
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,110
and guess

3702
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:31,040
I guess.

3703
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,800
So if others ask me,

3704
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,000
if people ask me

3705
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,470
or more complementary?

3706
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:39,120
I think we'll choose something similar.

3707
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,240
We actually lack this part.

3708
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:45,680
Yes.

3709
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,120
We always hang out there.

3710
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,350
If we didn't talk yesterday,

3711
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:53,360
I would definitely talk to you.

3712
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,200
I don't think we're the only ones.

3713
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,800
We just sit here

3714
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,160
Face to face. That's how we talk.

3715
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:01,280
I've always wanted to talk to you face to face.

3716
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:01,840
Right?

3717
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,280
But I didn't dare.

3718
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,560
You were brave yesterday.

3719
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,520
Why didn't you be brave?

3720
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,670
Why am I always brave?

3721
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,240
Do you know why?

3722
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:11,480
Because yesterday,

3723
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,320
I felt upset.

3724
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,870
It's like a twist.

3725
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:18,520
I feel so bad.

3726
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,030
For so many days,

3727
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:20,960
even more painful

3728
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,160
when I cried that day.

3729
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,000
After the soul of the soup,

3730
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,320
I will think

3731
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,950
what kind of feeling

3732
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:30,720
and the answer

3733
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,030
with your heart.

3734
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:34,520
Even if we didn't have a date today,

3735
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,960
I'd go to

3736
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,110
the House of Feelings

3737
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:40,080
to make it clear to you.

3738
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,720
Then you suddenly took a photo of me.

3739
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:43,390
Then I said it was you.

3740
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:43,800
Yes.

3741
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,510
At that time,

3742
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:45,880
when I stood up,

3743
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:48,030
I was like a stone.

3744
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:49,400
I said,

3745
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:51,480
we can finally talk face to face.

3746
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:55,280
In the end, I'm braver and decisive.

3747
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:59,480
What do you think

3748
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:01,360
what do you think

3749
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:03,480
need to have?

3750
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:05,680
What characteristics?

3751
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:12,320
I think for me,

3752
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:14,590
I can't accept cold violence.

3753
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:15,760
Don't worry.

3754
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,630
I am

3755
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:18,560
hot violence.

3756
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,240
Will you shout "hot violence"?

3757
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,760
If I really reach that point,

3758
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,280
I think

3759
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,190
We don't have to argue.

3760
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:26,200
I will try to communicate.

3761
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,320
I don't like cold violence.

3762
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,800
I don't like cold violence either.

3763
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,520
It's hard.

3764
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,960
I hate things

3765
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,000
that's cold and hot.

3766
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:32,830
I'm...

3767
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,880
One more thing.

3768
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,280
I want to be with excellent people.

3769
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,630
How do I define that?

3770
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:43,840
Just occasionally.

3771
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,880
But you can't lie down and break it every day.

3772
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,160
Yes.

3773
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,760
One more thing.

3774
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,070
I want.

3775
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:52,720
But I think many people don't have this point.

3776
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:53,840
But I actually saw

3777
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:54,640
on you.

3778
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,880
Many things

3779
02:04:57,880 --> 02:04:59,440
I don't need to make it clear.

3780
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:00,440
you will notice

3781
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:02,000
For example,

3782
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,920
I said you came to Beijing for postgraduate entrance exam.

3783
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,150
So what?

3784
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,720
Because I know

3785
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,440
with my own heart.

3786
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,910
my little selfishness.

3787
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:13,680
Xiaoling. But I don't think anyone would notice it.

3788
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:16,760
But I didn't expect you to notice it.

3789
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,480
What I can do is

3790
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:22,360
is...

3791
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:24,080
I'll visit you on holidays.

3792
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,590
Come home often.

3793
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,710
Or come to play with me.

3794
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,430
Work hard for the postgraduate entrance exam.

3795
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:31,550
Getting into Beijing

3796
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:34,240
I put pressure on you.

3797
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,200
Come on.

3798
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,790
In my previous plan,

3799
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:40,670
in my previous plan.

3800
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:41,240
But when you...

3801
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,680
you didn't tell me

3802
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,360
about it,

3803
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:44,720
I would think

3804
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:47,000
I've already started to ask

3805
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,080
That's right.

3806
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:48,880
Yes.

3807
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,480
I'm already asking.

3808
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,120
Okay.

3809
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,600
Just take mine

3810
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,520
into your plan.

3811
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,040
Yes.

3812
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:57,360
In the future,

3813
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,840
we must understand each other.

3814
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,150
It's hard for us

3815
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:03,200
to meet or something.

3816
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:04,720
So I think we should communicate more.

3817
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:10,110
I'm curious about one more thing.

3818
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:11,710
after the show,

3819
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:12,400
do you want to

3820
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,950
keep in touch with me?

3821
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:16,720
Definitely.

3822
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:17,560
I think both of us

3823
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:20,240
both professional and interest,

3824
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:22,400
we will definitely

3825
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,160
contact each other

3826
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,760
and get to know each other.

3827
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,200
What do you think

3828
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,990
you are worried about?

3829
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:31,680
Actually, I'm not that old.

3830
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,720
Although I may be a little younger than you,

3831
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,960
but I might...

3832
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,030
I shouldn't

3833
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:37,950
I'm not a little younger than you, am I?

3834
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:39,360
I'm not sure.

3835
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:41,200
It's hard to say.

3836
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,520
Yeah, anyway,

3837
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,800
In my opinion, it's mainly about distance.

3838
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,880
You can't stand long-distance relationship.

3839
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,360
Well,

3840
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:49,310
Although we said before

3841
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:52,080
we would want some space to be alone.

3842
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,200
But

3843
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,160
I'm not

3844
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:55,600
I'm not that clingy.

3845
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:56,320
but

3846
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:57,150
I think these two

3847
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,680
can be combined.

3848
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,630
But sometimes, for example,

3849
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:02,720
my family or someone

3850
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:03,200
sent me a message.

3851
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,880
I won't reply to him.

3852
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,680
I'll definitely say I'll go back later.

3853
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:08,640
That kind of personality.

3854
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:10,960
Okay, the prevention shot has been shot.

3855
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,960
Got it.

3856
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:13,950
That's all.

3857
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:15,160
I'm like...

3858
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,800
For example, I may be busy now.

3859
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,920
I can't talk to you.

3860
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,840
I'll say I'll come to you later.

3861
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:20,480
I really

3862
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:21,950
who likes to play videos.

3863
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:24,830
If I'm really happy and want to share,

3864
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:26,800
I'll play a video right away.

3865
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:27,840
Be it happy

3866
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,760
or sad,

3867
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,840
I think you can hear my voice

3868
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,960
and my expression.

3869
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,680
I'll wait for your video call.

3870
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,760
Yes.

3871
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:42,430
Today, Xiaoling and I

3872
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:44,320
with Xiao Ling.

3873
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,270
I know she meant it.

3874
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:47,920
I made the right choice.

3875
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,960
I'll make myself clear.

3876
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:56,990
During today's regret date,

3877
02:07:56,990 --> 02:07:58,400
I can feel that

3878
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,280
care about what I say.

3879
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:02,320
My relationship with Tu has increased.

3880
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,240
The night before the confession

3881
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:14,080
In order to

3882
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,840
confirm each other's feelings better.

3883
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,320
Next, we will ask her

3884
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,080
I'll ask him a question instead of my brother.

3885
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:22,200
I'll tell you when the court is here.

3886
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,760
If someone else

3887
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:24,560
does everything to you,

3888
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:25,920
you will still like him, right?

3889
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,360
What a sharp question.

3890
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,360
Are both parties equal in love?

3891
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,040
You scared me.

3892
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,760
After getting in touch with Tata,

3893
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,510
did you regret

3894
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:34,800
what you regret in the house?

3895
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,110
Do you mind being a match?

3896
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,280
Since you're not sure about your feelings,

3897
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,360
you've been

3898
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,680
giving the signal to Xiaoling.

3899
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,560
Are you looking for a way out for yourself?

3900
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,080
You look like a face.

3901
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:50,200
If Tae-seo had been in the house from the beginning,

3902
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,160
would you choose Tae-seo more firmly?

3903
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:01,440
I want to express my feelings

3904
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,640
my feelings.

3905
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,360
If he likes me,

3906
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,760
he'll confess to me.

3907
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,110
I know

3908
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:07,280
my feelings.

3909
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,200
I think he'll confess to me.

3910
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:12,030
I don't think anyone will.

3911
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:14,200
Tell them

3912
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,000
your true thoughts.

3913
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,560
You didn't do it.

3914
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,790
There must be some regrets.

3915
02:09:17,790 --> 02:09:20,400
I still need to convey my thoughts.

3916
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,320
Because I like this girl very much.

3917
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,840
I want to fight for her.

3918
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:25,600
for such a long time.

3919
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:27,040
Don't let this relationship down.
