Come on. Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
A party with wild wine. I feel there will be

3
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,640
It feels like

4
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
Let's have some wild wine right away.

5
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,440
Susu.
Oh no.

6
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Rules of check-in.

7
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,520
Susu.
How to open it?

8
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Soup.
Hello.

9
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,360
Thank you.
Susu.

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,280
Susu.
Okay.

And...
Soup.

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
There's a rack here.
Soup.

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,680
Okay.

15
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160

Put down your clothes.

Susu.
What about you?

22
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
Soup.
Just call me Soup.

00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Susu.
Soup. Okay.

24
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720

There are rules here.
Soup.

30
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,320
Okay.

31
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,600
This is the same as the one at the door, right?

32
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,640
Is it at the door?
Soup.

33
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,240
Susu.
It's at the gate.

34
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No.
Soup.

35
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
Sorry for asking too much.
Susu.

36
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
It's quite awkward.
Susu.

37
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,520
Soup.
Not bad.

38
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,120
What can we talk about?
Soup.

39
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
Susu.
What's your MBTI?

40
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Soup.
Take a guess.

41
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,160
Susu.
I guess

42
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Susu.
Are you an introvert?

43
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,480
Soup.
No.

44
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
Susu.
You are E.

45
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,880

How many mistakes?
Soup.

51
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Susu.

52
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
But I already know.

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,440
The soup. I figured it was ENTJ. Commander-type personality.

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Susu.
ENTJ.

56
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Susu.
You're T (logical).

57
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,200
Susu.
I'm thirsty.

58
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,960

I want some water.

59

You can drink it.
Soup.

64
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you want to try it? Do you want it?
Susu.

65
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Soup.
No, you drink it.

66
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,880
Susu.
You don't want it?

67
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,280
Soup.
I'm not thirsty.

68
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you.

Susu.
Water.

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
She's naive and cute.
Soup.

74
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,480
Susu.
Wait.

75
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
Hwa.
You can't tell anyone here.

76
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,400
Whose siblings are you?
Hwa.

77
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Hwa, please call each other by their names.

78
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,960

Okay.

A fierce knocking sound.

It's quite loud.

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200

Soup.
I'll take your luggage there.

90
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,880

It's okay. Thank you.

91
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,120

Why don't you take a look?

97
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Hua.
Okay, I'll do it myself.

98
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,040
I haven't asked your name yet.
Susu.

99
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,040

Soup
Soup for soup.

112
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
They're all folding lyrics.
Soup

113
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,640
Hua.
Who will come in first?

114
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,840
Soup.
I'll be the first to come in.

115
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,560
Flower.
Did you stay long?

116
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Soup.
It's awkward.

117
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
Flower.
I'm fine when I'm alone.

118
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
I think there will be some when it's just the two of us.
Flower.

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,400
No.
Soup?

120
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560

We just talked about MBTI.

Susu.
I'm ISFP.

129

00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080

ENTJ.

132
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,480
ISFP.
Susu.

Susu.
We have two different personalities.

135
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Susu.
E.

136
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,600
It's obvious.
Susu.
E.

137
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
It looks too obvious.
Susu.

Hua.
Let me disguise it.

142
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm not actually...
Hua.

143
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,760
Hua.
I lied to you.

144
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Harry.
Rules for check-in.

145
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,680
Harry.
You can't tell anyone who your siblings are here.

146
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,320
or siblings.
Harry.

147
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,200
What if I can't get in?
Harry.

148
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm trapped.
Harry!

149
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,640
Harry.
I'm thinking.

150
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,760
No wonder no one opened the door.
Harry.

151
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,360
Harry
Learn Greek

Harry

153
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,640
Is this door not working?
Harry.

154
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,120
Susu.
Someone is here.

155
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
Soup.
The sound of knocking sounds more like a man.

156
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,400
Hua.
Hello.

157
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,960
Come in.

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
Take off your shoes here?
Harry.

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,520

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:05,880
Susu.
Yes.

161
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,480
Harry.
Hello.

162
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,320
Harry.
It's freezing.

163
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Let's go inside.
Harry.

164
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
What's your name?
Harry.

165
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,520
Hua.

166
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
Susu.

167
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Harry.
Call me by my English name, Harry.

168
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,080
Susu.
My first impression of Harry was him.

169
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
The northeast smell is strong.
Susu.

170
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,360
It smells northeast.

171
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,800
Hua.
Take a small bag.

172
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
I was thinking about your luggage.
Hua.

173
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
Hwa.
That's all I thought.

174
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,400
Just sit here, right?
Harry.

175
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,520
Have a seat.
Hua.

176
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,480
Harry.
It's not that awkward to have less people.

177
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,400
Hua.
It's not that awkward to have more people.

178
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,560
Really?
Harry.

179
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,000
Harry.
The four of us

180
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,560
Flower.
Who are you? What's MBTI?

181
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
I'll scare you to death.
Harry.

182
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,000
Harry.
INFJ.

183
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Do you believe me?
Harry.
INFJ.

184
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,599
Harry.
I'm an introvert.

185
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm an introvert.
Harry.

186
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,680
Harry.
I feel so awkward.

187
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,240
That's why I keep talking.
Harry.

188
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,000
Harry.
Do you understand?

189
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,280
Hua.
Really?

190
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,839
Really?
Harry.

191
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,560
Flower.
That's a match.

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,040
One I (introverted) and E.
Flower.

193
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,320
Soup.
You're an introvert.

194
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm INFJ.
Harry.

195
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Soup.
I'm E.

196
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
Which one of us is E?
Soup.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,160
Hua.
You've been talking all the time.

198
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,760
He didn't talk.
Hua.

199
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,280
Harry.
No, I'm embarrassed.

200
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,400
Susu.
Fake E.

201
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,720
Soup.
Tell me. It's fun.

202
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
It won't be awkward if I tell you.
Soup.

203
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
It's fun.
Harry.

204
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
Flower.
I (introverted) is more interesting.

205
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
Flower, I (introverted) is E. Human "toy".

206
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,840
Hua.
You are so introverted.

207
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,360
Harry.
Okay, I won't sit here.

208
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,400
I need to take a walk.
Harry.

209
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,160
Hua.
He's afraid it'll be awkward sitting here.

210
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
Gym.
Harry.

211
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,280
Basketball court.
Harry.

212
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,040
I usually play badminton.
Harry.

213
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,200
Harry.
I looked outside.

214
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,680
There's a house that needs to be unlocked.
Harry.

215
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Harry.
A date.

216
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,240
You should use it on a date.
Harry.

217
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
Harry.
And sand pit.

218
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,280
It's for long jumping.
Harry.

219
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
Harry!
Feather ball.

220
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Basketball.
Harry!

221
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,520
Hua.
Do you play basketball?

222
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,000
You're so tall.
Harry.

223
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,520
Susu.
So tall.

224
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,480
You're so tall. It's a pity not to play basketball.
Susu.

225
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,560
What a pity.
Harry.

226
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
Soup.
A stereotype.

227
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,680
Harry.
It's not a stereotype.

228
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,280
Susu.
How tall are you?

229
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,000
Soup.
I'm not 1.9 meters tall.

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm less than two meters.
Harry.

231
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
Hua.
I'm less than two meters. What a coincidence.

232
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,360
Soup.
I'm over 1 meter tall.

233
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
1.87 meters.
Soup.

234
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,520
Susu.
So tall.

235
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
Soup.
I have a hunchback.

236
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,120
I'll buy you a backpack.
Harry.

237
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,120
Harry
I'm hungry.

238
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm very hungry now.
Harry

239
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,520
Susu.
I'm also hungry.

240
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Harry.
I'm very hungry.

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,480
I haven't eaten for six hours.
Harry.

242
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,680
Susu.
Can you cook?

243
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
Flower.
A little.

244
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,080
But not much.
Flower.

245
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
Harry.
A little.

246
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,960
Hua.
It's edible.

247
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
Ramyeon.
Harry.

248
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
Hua.
I'm not hungry.

249
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
Harry.

250
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,320
Hwa.
Boys.

251
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,760
Harry.
Do you want to come with me?

252
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,480
It's so ritual.
Harry.

253
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,120
Hua.
When you came,

254
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
Aren't we welcoming you together?
Hua.

255
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,240
Harry.
Of course.

256
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,080
You're so nice.
Harry.

257
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,040
Let me do it.
Harry.

258
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Wait.
Harry.

259
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
Welcome.
Hua.

260
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,440
Harry.
Hello.

Just come in.
Harry.

Do you want to change slippers?
Fatty.

263
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,000
Soup.
Yes, change them.

264
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Harry.
You're an introvert.

265
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,640
or E?
Harry.

266
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,760
Fatty.
E.

267
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Fatty.

Okay.

You can put your luggage here.
Harry.

270
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,320
Fatty.
Okay.

271
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,760

How should I address you?

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,320
Hua.
Okay.

280
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,560
Fatty.
Maybe I'm fat.

281
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,800
Hua.
No.

282
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Fatty.
Aren't you cold?

283
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Susu.
I'm sweating.

284
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,040
Fatty.
It's freezing.

285
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,080
I'll get you some hot water.
Soup.

286
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,040
Yes, I'll get you some hot water.
Harry.

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Let's go.
Fatty.

288
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Fatty.
Yeah, I don't know your name yet.

289
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,200
Soup.
Let's introduce ourselves.

290
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
Just call me Soup.
Soup.

291
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Fatty.
Soup?

292
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
My name is Harry.
Harry.

293
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,800
Fatty.
Harry.

294
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,200
What about you?
Fatty.
Harry.

295
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,280
Susu.

296
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,480
Hua.

297
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,920

299
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,840
Soup.

300
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
Fatty.
You don't have to take the exam later, right?

301
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,640
Harry.
I have to take the exam.

302
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,760
Everyone comes in and asks.
Harry.

303
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,360
Fatty.
Okay.

304
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,360
Do you remember?
Harry.

305
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,600
Fatty.
I think I remember.

306
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
Fatty.
Are we waiting for them now?

307
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,480
Flower.
Yes.

308
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,920
Soup.
We can talk.

309
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,760
But we don't know what to say.
Soup.

310
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
Soup.
We're always I (introverted).

311
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,520
It's guiding the rhythm to feel juice.
Soup.

312
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm an introverted man.
Soup.

313
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,360
Fatty.
I don't think you did it right.

314
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,080
Do it again.
Fatty.

315
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,840
Harry.
Let me tell you.

316
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,560
I've tested it 20 times.
Harry.

317
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
Joon
Harry

318
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
Fatty.
Another 2025 version

319
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,120
Okay.
Harry.

320
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,840
Soup?
Are you from Guangdong?

321
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,880
Susu.
I thought you can't guess.

322
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,240
Soup.
I didn't guess HAVEG. I asked.

323
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
Susu.
I asked you as soon as I came in.

324
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Didn't you say you can't tell me?
Susu.

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
Fatty.
The next one should be a girl.

326
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
Harry.
It should be a girl.

327
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,080
Yes.
Harry.

328
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
This must be a girl.
Harry.

329
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,160
I heard her nails knocking.
Harry

330
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
Harry.
Girls, hurry.

331
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,200
Let's go.
Harry.
Girls, hurry.

I have a service.
Fatty.

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Harry.
What are you laughing at?

346
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,240
They really look alike.
Harry.

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Have a seat.
Harry.

Thank you.

352
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Hua.
Excuse me.

353
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,080
Hua.
Sit next to each other.

354
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Soup.
Is it crowded?

355
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
Xiaoling.
I'm Xiao Ling.

356
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,760
Hua.

357

360
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,160
Xiao Ling.
Okay.

361
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160

My name is Harry.

362
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,760

What?

368
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,400
Fatty.

369
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,320
My name is easier to remember.
Fatty.

370
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,800
Xiao Ling.
Okay.

371
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
Susu.
It's too obvious.

372
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
I want to laugh when Xiaoling comes in.
Susu.

373
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
Susu.
They look like a family.

374
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,080
Hua and the two of them look so exotic.

375
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,400

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,080
Xiao Ling.
I'm doomed.

377
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,560
I haven't started yet.
Xiao Ling.

378
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,280
Hide it.
Soup.

379
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,240
Flower.
Master, why don't you give it to me?

380
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
What would you like to drink?
Soup.

381
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,920
Soup.
How many people want water?

382
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
Xiao Ling.
Let's take a look.

383
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,760

Okay.

Just take it.

Thank you.
Xiao Ling.

390
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,040
Xiao Ling.
Can everyone cook?

391
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,880
Susu.
I won't.

392
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,960
Xiao Ling.
I won't either.

393
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,240
Susu.
I don't seem to know how to do it.

394
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Can you do it?
Susu.

395
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,640
I can only do it.
Fatty.

396
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Susu.
You can only...

397
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,720

Oh no.

398
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,600

399
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,120
Hello.

400
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,040
Did you cook well?
Susu.

401
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,840
Harry.
Very delicious.

402
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
I've never seen anyone who cooks better than me.
Harry.

403
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,640
To be honest,
Harry.

404
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,840
Fatty.
So you really

405
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
I really know how to cook.
Harry.

406
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,720

Yes.

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,200
That's the chef.
Harry

408
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,720
Hua.
He doesn't know how to turn the spoon.

409
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,280
That's a spoon.
Harry.

410
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320

How much weight do you want to lose?
Harry.

Try to be Fatty when you come in.

427
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
When you go out, it's called slim.
Fatty.

428

00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,840
Xin.
So cute.

536
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,680
Yes.
Map.

537
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,760
Xiaoling.
And I'm Xiao Ling.

538
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,680
Xin.
Xiaoling.

539
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,960
Xinxin.
I think the soup and Xiaoling

540
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,200
must be real brothers.
Xinxin.

541
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,760
Xin.
They could be twins.

542
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,960
They are so handsome.
Xin.

543
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,920
Xiaoling.
I think Susu and the map are siblings.

544
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,000
Xiaoling.
Maybe it's Xin.

545
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,640
Harry.
Can you cook?

546
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,440
Excuse me.
Harry.

547
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Xinxin.
A little.

548
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,080
Flower.
What?

549
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
We can do it a little bit.
Flower.

550
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,960
Hua.
But we are humble.

551
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,200
Fatty.
In our team,

552
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
There's already someone who's good at cooking.
Fatty.

553
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Flower.
Harry.

554
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,240
Fatty.
Sit in the middle.

555
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,800
Flower.
Harry.

556
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Right.
Flower.

557
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,840
We all saw it.
Flower.

558
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
Hua.
Sit down.

559
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,680
Soup.
You can't go out from today.

560
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,920
We won't be able to eat.
Soup.

561
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,880
Harry.
I'll call and tell them I'm going out.

562
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm going out.
Harry.

563
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,400
Soup.
I want to laugh when I see her.

564
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Remember her name is Xiaoling.
Soup.

565
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,720
Soup.
Don't call her by her nickname.

566
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,160
Or call her sister?
Soup.

567
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,480
Map.
I think my brothers and I...

568
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,960
You hid it well.
Map.

569
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,600
Map.
Because we didn't deliberately avoid each other.

570
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
We didn't get close on purpose.
Map.

571
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,320
She's a little restrained today.
Map.

572
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,840
I think we're good at acting.
Tu.

573
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
Actually, I dare not talk to him.

574
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,320
Susu.
I'm afraid

575
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,600
We were too close.
Susu.

576
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,360
Susu.
I don't want to talk to him.

577
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,080
I pretend I didn't hear him.
Susu.

578
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,040
Xinxin.
I think he's really relaxed.

579
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,800
I think he really enjoys it.
Xinxin.

580
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,520
Xinxin.
I tried my best today.

581
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,400
is hiding our relationship.
Xinxin.

582
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Xinxin.
Because as soon as I entered,

583
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,760
I might subconsciously
Xinxin.

584
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,560
Xinxin.
to ask for his help.

585
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,480
I didn't look at him on purpose.
Xinxin.

586
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Harry.
I don't want others to see it.

587
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,200
You can't tell
Harry.

588
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,120
Harry.
if we don't communicate.

589
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,160
I think
Harry.

590
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,600
Harry.
with everyone.

591
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Nothing special.
Harry.

592
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,880
is the best hiding.
Harry.

593
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,800
Map.
We can choose the room first.

594
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,520
Let's go.
Harry.

595
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,720
Let's take a look.
Map.

596
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
This is a man's room.
The map.

597
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,080
I'll sleep here.
Soup.

598
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,400
Okay, sleep outside.
Harry.

599
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,680
This is really cool.
Map.

600
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,120
Flower.
It can shine.

601
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,440
The view is great.
Map.

602
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,280
The second one for boys.
Map.

603
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,120
This room is nice too.
Fatty.

604
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
We'll stay here.
Map.

605
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,480
So comfortable.
Tu.

606
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
This is for a girl, right?
Xinxin.

607
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,160
This is the first girl's room.
Map

608
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,600
Xinxin.
Let's choose this one.

609
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,160
Hua.
I think

610
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,320
Every room is quite comfortable.
Hua.

611
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
Nice.
Xiao Ling.

612
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
There's a girl's room here.
Map.

613
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,600
Susu.
There's a living room here.

614
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
I like this one.
Susu.

615
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
And the balcony.
Xiao Ling.

616
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,600
This is the cap room.
Susu.

617
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
This room is nice.

This house is so warm.
Flower.

624
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,719
Matu, I feel I'm looking forward to the next 20 days.

Yes.

626

Can any of you play the piano?

What do you want to hear?

634
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,440
I want to listen to "Mid-Autumn Festival".
Harry.

635
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,800
Soup.
I don't know how to play it even if you order a song.

636
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,880
I'll only play it.
Soup.

637
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,920
Play it.
Harry.

638
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,000

So can we listen to the performance now?

Yes.

Don't mind.
Soup.

643
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,800
Harry.
You're modest again.

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,120
Okay.

I think the soup is cool.

655
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,200
I was shocked.
Fatty.

Fatty.
It's really nice.

657

Let's share it.

They might be the siblings of the date.

677
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,840
I don't understand.
Harry.

678
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,280
Soup.
For example, B and C are siblings.

You're doing math problems now, right?
Harry.

680
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,840
Soup.
If A likes B, she has to choose C.

Xiao Ling.
I guess

For example,
Xiao Ling.

690
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,040

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,400
A happy and cheerful boy.
Harry.

710
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,080
Hua.
To write?

711
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Let's go.
Xiao Ling.

712
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,840
Hua.
Let me think about how to write it.

713
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,480
This is hard.
Xinxin.

714
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,640
Xinxin.
Because you have to choose two questions.

715
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,800
Xinxin.
You should know

716
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,560
Who is your brother?
Xinxin.

717
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,400
Write a heart.

718
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,000
Susu.
I want to send a letter to Xiaoling Cupid.

719
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,480
Susu.
I think this is a destiny.

720
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,520
not an unknown number.
Susu.

721
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,160
Susu.
I'm afraid of the feeling of unknown.

722
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,000
Who is his brother?
Hua.

723
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,480
Flower.
I think we get along well.

724
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,400
Hua.
It matches the eyes.

725
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,200
Xinxin.
My observation today

726
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,360
Xinxin.
I think they must be brothers.

727
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,720
Xin, can we go on a date together?

728
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,840
Esther.
we can be very happy.

729
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,400
He can be relaxed.
Esther.

730
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
Xiao Ling.
I think he's more careful.

731
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,080
And he is
Xiao Ling.

732
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,520
who cares about others.
Xiao Ling.

733
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,800
I'll give it to you.
Susu.

734
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,280
Xiao Ling.
Okay.

735
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,960
Hua.
Let's go down.

736
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,240
Help them cook.
Hua.

737
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,160
Xiao Ling.
Go down.

738
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,440
Fatty.
Soup. Hello.

739
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,320
We should start cooking.
Fatty.

740
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,040
I'll take it out and thaw it.
Harry.

741
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,400
Fatty.
I can cut the chicken wings.

742
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,520
Harry.
No need.

743
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,320
Just change the knife.
Harry.

744
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,840
Harry.
Let's finish it first.

745
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Then change the knife.
Harry.

746
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,160
Fatty.
Bro, you're great.

747
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,600
I won't
Fatty.

748
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Fatty.
after I go out?

749
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,360
Harry.
I won't let you gain another 20 jin.

750
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,120
Don't worry.
Harry.

751
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,440
Here?
Fatty.

752
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,800
Change the knife here.
Fatty.

753
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,160
Harry.
No.

754
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,800
Not now.
Harry.

755
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,080
Fatty.
Professional.

756
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Harry.
Just wash the vegetables.

757
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,600
Ginger, wine, green onion.
Harry.

758
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,160
Fatty.
Professional.

759
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,600
Soup.
I've never tried it.

760
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,040
I think I need to learn first.
Soup.

761
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,200
Soup.
I'll wash it wrongly.

762
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,360
Fatty.
Professional.

763
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,600
Soup.
Let me observe.

764
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,200
Harry.

765
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,080
It's oily.
Harry.

766
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,200
Fatty.
What else is there?

767
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Onion.
Fatty.

768
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,040
Someone doesn't want scallion.
Soup.

769
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,600
Someone doesn't eat green onions.
Harry.

770
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,600
Harry.
It's Xinxin who doesn't eat onions or coriander, right?

771
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,280
How can this be thawed quickly?
Xinxin.

772
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,440
Harry.
You don't know how to do it quickly.

773
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Only
Harry.

774
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:28,960
Hot water.
Xin.

775
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
Put it in the basin and warm water.
Harry.

776
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,960
Can you open it?
Harry.

777
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,160
Esther.
Yes.

778
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,200
Very cold.
Esther.

779
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,840
Harry.
What an ugly fish.

780
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,680
"Shangfang Sword".
Harry.

781
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,000
As long as you can eat.
Xinxin.

782
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,520
Harry.
I'm a little scared.

783
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,400
I dare not.
Harry.

784
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,960
Xinxin.
How ugly is it?

785
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,760
Harry.
No, I mean it's dirty.

786
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
Xinxin.
You're disgusting.

787
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,200
It's not ugly. It's just a little flat.
Xinxin.

788
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,120
Xinxin.
It's not ugly.

789
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,160
Harry, I've seen the evolution history of the Dobo Fish.
Harry.

790
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,800
I had two eyes next to me.
Harry.

791
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,960
He's different.
Harry

792
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,240
Xinxin.
Harry is funny.

793
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,520
About the fish,
Xinxin.

794
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,960
First, he said my fish was ugly.
Xinxin.

795
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,080
Then,
Xinxin.

796
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,280
Xin.
Then he told me

797
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,200
The fish should remove the tail
Xin.

798
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,560
Xinxin.
All the organs.

799
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,560
Harry.
Take its tail off.

800
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,480
You have to go to your organs.
Harry.

801
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,960
Harry.
Are you going to the organs?

802
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,680
Xin.
You don't have to go to your organs.

803
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,320
Are you going with the slime?
Harry.

804
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,600
Just wash it.
Xinxin.

805
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,520
It has scales.
Harry.

806
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,960
Xinxin.
I start to doubt myself

807
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,200
Xinxin.
Well...

808
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,720
Xinxin.
Really?

809
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,520
From that second on,
Xinxin.

810
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,600
Xinxin.
he was very abstract.

811
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,880
Fatty
Come on.

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,720
Fatty.
Should we wash the rice first?

822
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,440
Hua.
You need to pour it first to wash it.

823
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,640
That's called pouring rice.
Xinxin.

824
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,720
Fatty.
Poop rice?

825
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,640
You're so strict.
Fatty.

00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,480
Fatty.
Come on.

This is a dish.
Fatty.

861
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,880
What is stewed?
Map.

I want to eat hand grabbing rice.
Harry.

864
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,400
Xinxin.
Hold on.

865
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,480
Harry.
You don't understand what I mean.

866
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,800
Soup.
It hints here.

867
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,840
Harry.
No.

868
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,720

They all think I'm from the northwest.
Soup?

875
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,120
Soup.
Make me a big plate of chicken tomorrow.

It'll be fun if you find out you're wrong.
Soup.

Two chefs.

Xin.
I'm still a chef.

2848

What? You didn't make the Dobo Fish?
Harry.

2849
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,520
Xin.
Have you eaten?

2850
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,720
I definitely ate it.
Harry.

I can make dumplings.
Harry.

2859
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,000
Xinxin.
It's too hard to make dumplings.

2860
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,280
Harry.
You can't try, right?

2861
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,200
Harry.
Buy it.

Fresh and thin shredded pork.

01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,960
Check the expiration date.
Harry.

01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,280
This will work.
Xinxin.

Soup!
Where are we going?

2866
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:43,320
Give me one.
Harry.

Okay, you're the boss.
Harry.

01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:02,590
Harry.
Let's take a bigger one.

2873
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:03,600
Okay, it's quite fair.
Harry.

2874
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:04,400
This is big.
Harry.

2875
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,560
This is so ugly.
Xinxin.

01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,080
Beans.
Harry.

2877
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,120
Harry.
Forget it. I can't buy beans.

2878
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,280
The beans are not cooked.
Harry.

2879
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,160

What a small egg.

2880

Eggs.
Harry

This one.
Xinxin.

2884
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,800
Harry.
I think so too.

2885
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:19,840
I really have OCD.
Harry.

2886
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,960
Harry.
You don't know what true OCD is.

2887
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,200
Xinxin.
I know you have OCD.

2888
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:22,910
I feel it.
Xinxin.

2889
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:23,680
How about cutting it with this?
Xin.

Really?
Xinxin.

Xinxin.
It doesn't.

I want chicken drumsticks and chicken wings.

Harry.
I'll buy you ten burgers later.

I'll heat one for you every morning.
Harry.

Xinxin.
Here comes the drumstick.

2901
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,070
Xin.
You pick it. I can't.

2902
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:47,390
Give it to me.
Harry.

Soup.
Do you have bags?

2904
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,400
Xinxin.
Yes, I went to get it.

2905
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,360

I'm tired.

Xinxin.
Do you know how to make gimbap soup?

2917
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,470
Harry.
I can learn.

2918
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:34,880
Xinxin.
It should be simple.

2919
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:36,080
Harry.
It's not hard.

2920
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,440
Xinxin.
Don't chew gum.

2921
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,160
Harry.
Can't I?

2922
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:45,880
Xinxin.
No.

2923

Oh no.

Do you want hazelnut cocoa sauce?
Harry.

2966
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,160

Susu.
Now?

01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,710
Soup.
I think

2979
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:33,470
Maybe I'm interested in the map.
Soup.

2980
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,710
Soup.
That's why I'm still confused.

2981
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,520
I don't know what's going on either.
Soup.

2982
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,640

Go.

Push that one.

Let's go.
Fatty.

Fatty.
The soup is hard to control.

2991
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:49,720
Soup.
Put it together.

2992
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,200
Fatty.
It's really hard to control the car.

2993
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,560
We need to cooperate.
Fatty.

2994
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,640
Fatty.
Push the cart down first.

2995
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,560
Fatty.
Get the car over there.

2996
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,520
Harry.
That's good.

2997
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,550
It can get stuck.
Harry.

2998
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,430
Harry.
I don't think I need to go out for two months.

2999
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:02,800
To be honest,
Harry.
I don't think I need to go out for two months.

3000
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,390
Fatty.
Yes.

3001

I'm in Tientsin.
Harry.

Harry.
How to sit?

3007
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,080
I'll take the passenger seat.
Harry.

3008
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,430
Fatty.
Let's go.

Let's go.
Fatty.

3010
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,310
Soup.
You won't let us play the song, right?

3011
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,560
Susu.
I can give you an earphone.

3012
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,320
Soup.
Okay, thank you.

3013
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:50,110

Let's switch.

3026

Okay.

My playlist is the best in the world.

Feeling young.
