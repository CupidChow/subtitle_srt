1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Is there anyone else

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,960
in the house?

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,880
No.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,840
Yes.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,800
Is that all?

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,600
Let me show you something.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,680
What?

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
Really?

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm a little annoyed.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,200
Did he make you angry?

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,160
To put it bluntly,

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,240
maybe he thinks

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,920
he doesn't want to keep in touch.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to hear

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,360
in the room.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Who first?

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,120
Xinxin.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
Love Siblings

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Let love double.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,400
Welcome to

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
brothers intervene in love.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,640
and social therapy.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,720
Love Sisters.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,400
We are

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,160
a family member.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,600
We're going to

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,280
the update of this episode.

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,400
Let's go.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's go. Come on.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Let's go.

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,280
Do you want a scarf?

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you cold?

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,200
The scarf.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Take it.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Okay, bye.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
Tata might be cold too.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Okay.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes, take it.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,200
I think so too.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Bye.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,520
Who made it?

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Guess.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Should I guess?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
Only a few people woke up.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Your roommate?

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Is it good?

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
What should I eat?

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm jealous.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
Actually, I really want to know

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
You...

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
The questions you and Tae-seo asked

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,200
Did you come here

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
after discussion?

54
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Most of the questions are his.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
What do you think of the answer?

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,800
You'll know later.

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,480
What do you mean by that?

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,320
I see.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,440
You want to hang me?

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
No, you answered well.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I gave you a grade.

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
How many marks? How many?

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm not telling you.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Is it inconvenient to tell you?

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,720
Let me tell you.

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
It feels like we're talking

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,440
80 percent.

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
You told me 20 percent.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
What? 20 percent?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,040
I don't know much.

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
I made my own judgment.

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
But you're right.

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Is it possible that

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
it's not a judgment.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,120
It's just that we're more alike.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
or I know you better.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
You know what you said is good.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
which touched him.

79
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
He told me

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,519
I don't know.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,839
He said

82
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
you think I'm a passive person.

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,840
Well,

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,480
I won't say it if I want to eat.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,040
But if you cook for me, I'll eat.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
He was surprised.

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
You may have noticed this.

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
He thinks when you say it, he will think

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,120
that's me.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
Not only did I say it, I also made it.

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
What?

92
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
I'll give you glutinous rice balls.

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,000
Actually, I usually

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,360
give everyone those glutinous rice balls.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't need to care about them.

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,720
I saw you washing the dishes.

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,520
You're embarrassed too.

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,240
Let me ask you.

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
I think you might not be full.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,520
But

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,960
I left some for you.

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,200
I know

103
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
you might be too shy to say

104
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,840
and you're embarrassed to bring food.

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,640
To be honest,

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm embarrassed to have so many people.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
So you said it secretly.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,040
Do you want some?

109
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Yes.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,840
I'll make four for you secretly.

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,840
How long have I been standing next to you?

112
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,520
Didn't you see?

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,800
I saw it.

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,320
I told you.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You were going to tell me

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,960
and pretended to stand next to me.

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,080
Of course, there was a chance.

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,680
Everything is in silence, to be honest.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
You have to say it.

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
Who will say it if you don't?

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,320
I'm the only one who speaks.

122
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
Can you be more stable?

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Wait.

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,840
Why?

125
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,280
She's a bit noisy, to be honest.

126
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Can you let her go down?

127
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,400
I want to talk.

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,280
But she's a bit noisy.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,520
This is our second date.

130
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Do you think you'll keep choosing me?

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
In other words, if you want to go on a date,

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,280
depends on the result.

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,600
The latter.

134
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,400
It depends on your performance.

135
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,680
What if...

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Go ahead.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll close the window first.

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Okay.

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,760
I have to close it.

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
No one can disturb my date.

141
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,800
How about this?

142
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
Is there anyone else

143
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,080
Is there anyone else you want to know?

144
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,400
No.

145
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,440
Didn't you know about others at first?

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
Yes.

147
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
Did everyone know it?

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
For many times,

149
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
you don't have to date her.

150
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
I can see

151
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,720
if I like this person

152
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
or if it suits me.

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
That's different.

154
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,920
We didn't get along so deeply.

155
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,560
Many details can be seen.

156
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360
They said when a lot of people

157
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
everyone laughs together.

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,280
The person who smiles

159
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,080
will look at the person he likes subconsciously.

160
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,000
A lot of details like this can tell

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,240
whether this person is suitable for me.

162
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,560
Actually,

163
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
three dates in total.

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,240
It was you twice.

165
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
One is Xiao Ling.

166
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
After dating Xiaoling,

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I think...

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
this is my buddy.

169
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
And

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
And Xinxin.

171
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,720
Xin has never dated her.

172
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,720
But you invited her.

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
You invited her?

174
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,560
Indeed.

175
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
I remember.

176
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
You remember. You can remember it.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
But let me tell you.

178
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
I told you.

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
I told you last time.

180
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,400
If we could set Cupid's date

181
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
in front of that.

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
I might choose you.

183
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,440
So I think

184
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,760
Cupid's date

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
a big change to you.

186
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
A big turning point.

187
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,280
I said I'm a passive person.

188
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,840
But if you need me to take the initiative,

189
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
I'll take the initiative.

190
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,720
Since you took the initiative,

191
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
I didn't cherish it.

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,280
So I must

193
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,120
take the initiative.

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
Go regret it.

195
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,360
Do you want to regret it?

196
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
I'll regret it now.

197
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,360
You still have a chance.

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,480
That's why I didn't text you that day.

199
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,200
How do you feel?

200
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,080
Let me ask you first.

201
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Why didn't you text me?

202
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,840
Let me ask you first.

203
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,160
I asked you first last time.

204
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,120
You asked me again.

205
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
That day...

206
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,680
In the afternoon,

207
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
with Tu this afternoon?

208
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,680
Then we went on a date at night.

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
But I think

210
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
we can send it to the map.

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
and get to know more about it.

212
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,840
That's what I think.

213
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,080
And I think I've already

214
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,480
the first three times.

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,640
I won't send it to you.

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
That's all?

217
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,280
Normally,

218
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,039
you didn't take the initiative

219
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,600
Then I sent it to you.

220
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,240
You didn't send it to me.

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
if you didn't send it to me.

222
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,640
But

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,240
I think you're an ISFJ.

224
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,799
And you're a girl.

225
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,560
I think I should take the initiative

226
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
to express my feelings.

227
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,080
Just like in the room in the Mirror.

228
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
I asked a question.

229
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
You are a

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
in love,

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,560
or an acceptable personality.

232
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
I may accept more than you.

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,280
But I will also

234
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,680
more.

235
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,320
For example,

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,520
70 percent.

237
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,520
I don't know.

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,840
Do you know what I said?

239
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,440
You said you're devoted.

240
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,800
I said I'm 100% dedicated.

241
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Let me show you something.

242
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,800
What?

243
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Wait. I'll close the door first.

244
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,920
What?

245
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,240
Really?

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm surprised.

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,320
What's your name?

248
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Bai.

249
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Yours?

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,000
What else?

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
Really.

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
It's really mine.

253
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Really.

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
It must be mine.

255
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
I didn't expect that.

256
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
I remember

257
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
you're walking other people's dog now.

258
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,440
You can take a walk.

259
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
Where was it just now?

260
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
It was outside.

261
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Peel it.

262
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,160
How heavy is it?

263
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
It's so small. How heavy is it?

264
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,800
Guoli.

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Untie me.

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
We talked about

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,360
we talked about

268
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,040
My dog passed away last year.

269
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm sad too.

270
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,280
I also said

271
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,800
I've been walking other people's dog.

272
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Then he

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
bring his dog here.

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
I think it's very touching.

275
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,080
Let's go.

276
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,800
Let's go.

277
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
What surprise?

278
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,960
BrantB is already very surprised.

279
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
I prepared this surprise

280
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,400
I prepared this surprise.

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Guess what it is.

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,480
We definitely talked about it.

283
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,520
I think you'll think it's great.

284
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,200
What is it?

285
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,680
Jelly Cat.

286
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
When did we talk?

287
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,240
Have you forgotten?

288
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,080
You told me you used the plane ticket.

289
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Just now.

290
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,400
Yes, just now.

291
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,280
I just bought it.

292
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,200
I predicted what you said.

293
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
So I bought it in advance.

294
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

295
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
Really.

296
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,360
And you happened to buy what I don't have.

297
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,960
Really?

298
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,480
Yes.

299
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,440
I chose it for another purpose.

300
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,520
What?

301
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
Why did you buy it?

302
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
I just want to predict you.

303
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,600
And I think

304
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,040
is quite similar to our personalities.

305
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,920
Is his mood stable?

306
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,640
Yes.

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,520
Not really.

308
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,520
How long did you sleep?

309
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,360
Not long.

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm a little annoyed.

311
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,440
Why?

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
Did he make you angry?

313
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
Not really.

314
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,440
But

315
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,640
we'll go back later.

316
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
We can play a game.

317
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,800
What game?

318
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's act.

319
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
Pretend we had a fight today.

320
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,120
We were unhappy.

321
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,640
Let them guess.

322
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,040
What do you think?

323
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,240
You can also see

324
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
your brother's reaction.

325
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,960
Right.

326
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,560
Right?

327
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,640
You can see how your brother reacts.

328
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,160
What do you think?

329
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,960
I think

330
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,000
To put it bluntly,

331
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
maybe he thinks

332
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,760
he doesn't want to contact him anymore.

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
I don't know what he's thinking.

334
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,600
After I came back today,

335
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
I didn't talk to him.

336
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
Can you make it clear?

337
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,200
I just don't know

338
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Why?

339
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,520
It's hard to say.

340
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,360
Is Hua here?

341
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,720
Inside.

342
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,760
What are you doing?

343
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,280
Nothing.

344
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,560
Go to the sofa and wait for me.

345
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,280
Okay.

346
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
What shall we eat tonight?

347
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,320
I'll cook for you two.

348
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,880
Sit down.

349
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,640
So nice.

350
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,200
Forget it.

351
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,800
Hua, I'm going back.

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
So awkward.

353
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Very awkward.

354
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
It means

355
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,720
she has different intentions.

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,640
and

357
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,280
something happened outside.

358
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,960
And

359
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,080
Different intentions.

360
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Did you fight with someone else?

361
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,120
Almost.

362
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,880
It's not a fight.

363
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,720
A quarrel.

364
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Yes.

365
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,200
You two had an argument

366
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
and had some conflicts with her.

367
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,680
Yes.

368
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,360
Probably.

369
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
She didn't say it just now.

370
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
She said she was unhappy.

371
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,080
Yes.

372
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
So awkward.

373
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
I saw her sitting here.

374
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
What's so awkward about it?

375
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Boys should be generous.

376
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,480
I don't know what happened.

377
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,520
I'll cook for you.

378
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,600
Go down.

379
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,880
Get changed.

380
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,720
It's freezing.

381
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,400
No.

382
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
Is anyone else back?

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
Someone is back.

384
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,440
I went to the supermarket.

385
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,000
You went to the supermarket today.

386
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,960
and had dinner outside.

387
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,960
Yes.

388
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
Xiao Ling, do you want some glutinous rice balls?

389
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm fine with anything.

390
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I bought the wonton

391
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Anything is fine.

392
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,040
Wonton and wonton.

393
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,520
Should I do it?

394
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
I'll make the one I made yesterday again.

395
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Xiaoling, Tu Tu is cooking.

396
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Okay.

397
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,040
I don't know. I'm not sleepy.

398
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,200
My eyes might be wearing contact lenses.

399
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,600
Wait.

400
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
Did he steal my house?

401
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Come here, Xiao Ling.

402
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,240
What's wrong?

403
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
Time to eat.

404
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,280
Coming.

405
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Wait.

406
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,280
Okay.

407
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,520
Thank you.

408
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,000
Come on.

409
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,640
Is it good?

410
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,920
Is it good?

411
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
Is drawing good?

412
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Yes.

413
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,080
Chef Tu, you are praised.

414
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,520
Really?

415
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,880
Is it good?

416
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Yes.

417
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Soup.

418
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,840
Coming.

419
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,720
Tu Tu made Xiaoling angry.

420
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,320
Really?

421
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,520
Really?

422
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
They stopped talking all the time.

423
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,600
I asked them

424
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
but they didn't tell me why.

425
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,880
So I need your help.

426
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Because this is the first time

427
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,200
Tu and Xiaoling look like this.

428
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,320
So scary.

429
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
I'm leaving.

430
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,440
Really?

431
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
And I don't know who caused it.

432
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,640
Tu just made noodles for Xiaoling.

433
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,360
Xiao Ling ate it.

434
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,880
I don't know if they made up.

435
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,240
Hey.

436
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,040
No.

437
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,760
I'll go with you.

438
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
You're finally back.

439
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,079
What happened?

440
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm not sure about the details.

441
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
We're not going skiing today.

442
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,720
We had some conflicts

443
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,319
with others.

444
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,359
Is it you two or someone else?

445
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes.

446
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
And we have

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
chain reactions.

448
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
Maybe I need to ask Xiao Ling

449
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
to know how to solve it.

450
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,760
Go ahead.

451
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,760
Tell me.

452
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,720
Just wait.

453
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Have a rest.

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,600
Okay.

455
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,120
I'll take a look upstairs.

456
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
What are you going to see?

457
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,880
Take a look.

458
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,080
Soup.

459
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,160
Here.

460
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,520
What?

461
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,280
It's nothing serious.

462
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
It's just

463
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,920
had a little quarrel with others.

464
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,440
We have different views.

465
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,840
You can do whatever you want.

466
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,280
But the map might think

467
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,320
I guessed it.

468
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,280
He didn't say much just now.

469
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,160
I don't know.

470
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,040
Let's forget about it.

471
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Is that so?

472
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,560
Something like that.

473
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
But

474
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,520
I know we have different views.

475
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
Then the two of us

476
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,920
didn't feel right.

477
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
He didn't talk after coming back.

478
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,320
Okay.

479
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
It's okay. Go back first.

480
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
Why don't you lie down?

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
I think I'll go downstairs in 20 minutes.

482
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,080
No.

483
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,600
I've been sleeping

484
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
for hours.

485
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,480
Okay.

486
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,640
I'll

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,040
tell Tu again.

488
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,840
Then you two will be fine

489
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
everything will be fine.

490
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,720
Don't go down.

491
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,960
If you go down now,

492
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
What else can I say?

493
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
He made Xiaoling angry.

494
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
If both of us

495
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
make mistakes

496
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
and argued.

497
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
What should we do?

498
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
What's wrong with you two?

499
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,240
Something happened.

500
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,920
And...

501
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Apologize.

502
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,480
I did.

503
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
But it's stiff.

504
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,520
Then why did you...

505
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
I don't think that's your personality.

506
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
Why didn't you tell her?

507
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,600
I did.

508
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,120
All the methods you just said

509
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
before you came back.

510
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,880
What did she say?

511
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Nothing.

512
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,120
What I know is...

513
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,600
What's wrong?

514
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,680
What did she say?

515
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,360
Most importantly,

516
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,520
maybe Xiao Ling had an argument with someone else.

517
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,920
Xiao Ling didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

518
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
But your first reaction

519
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,000
to calm it down.

520
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
That's actually right.

521
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,240
But Xiaoling's idea is

522
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,680
she might need you to take her side

523
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
and help her calm down.

524
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,120
and make her feel

525
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,160
she was treated fairly.

526
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,280
It's nothing.

527
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,200
Don't be too stressed.

528
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Okay, I'll go find her.

529
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,280
You're so good at listening.

530
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,760
Come on.

531
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,680
Good job.

532
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Come in.

533
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,320
It's a good show.

534
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
The soup came to me too.

535
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,440
What did he say?

536
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,160
He said if you told him,

537
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
you had a fight with someone else.

538
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,440
You just repeated it.

539
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,800
You're amazing.

540
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,080
Let's pretend to stay for a while.

541
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,720
Good evening.

542
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,040
It's too cold.

543
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Thank you.

544
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,400
Did you miss me?

545
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,240
What?

546
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,920
Do you miss me?

547
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,840
Yes.

548
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Linlin!

549
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Ready to condemn.

550
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
I've been waiting for a long time.

551
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,520
What?

552
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,360
Waiting for you.

553
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm so tired.

554
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,840
Hurry up.

555
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,560
Scold your roommate.

556
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,400
What's wrong?

557
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,840
Your roommate?

558
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,800
I'll stop.

559
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,040
What are you doing? Did you bully him?

560
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,080
They quarreled today.

561
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,800
You two quarreled?

562
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,680
Why?

563
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,040
Xiao Ling had a conflict with others in the snowfield.

564
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,240
her first reaction must be right.

565
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,040
to solve this problem.

566
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,360
But I didn't take Xiaoling's side first.

567
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
but to calm down the conflict.

568
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,320
Maybe Xiaoling is a little unhappy.

569
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,120
Tu.

570
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Do you know what friends mean?

571
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,200
Friends mean

572
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
whether it's right or wrong,

573
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
don't look at things, just look at people.

574
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,040
Right?

575
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,080
We must protect our weaknesses.

576
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,600
We must protect our weaknesses at the first moment.

577
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,120
Don't be sad, Tu.

578
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
You have no experience.

579
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
I think it makes sense.

580
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't think there's a problem with the drawing.

581
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,400
It's true.

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
I think it's not wrong

583
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,760
to solve this problem.

584
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,400
Why do you always say

585
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
I didn't protect you right away.

586
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,760
Because...

587
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,960
But I think

588
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,440
I think it's right

589
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,600
to solve the problem first.

590
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,880
It's a date today.

591
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,280
It's okay for my friend to hang out.

592
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,720
But your theme today is dating.

593
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,800
But I think you can adjust it.

594
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
But I don't think it's necessary

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
It's comforting.

596
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,200
You keep talking about his problem.

597
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
I said no problem.

598
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,520
I said it's a date.

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Dating should solve the problem first.

600
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
I don't think it's a problem

601
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,120
I don't think it's a problem.

602
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,440
But you're going on a date today.

603
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,800
It's okay.

604
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,920
There's still a misunderstanding between you two.

605
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
Let's make up.

606
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,040
It's already over.

607
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
We had a conversation just now.

608
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
What are you doing?

609
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,120
Nothing.

610
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,040
Actually, we...

611
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,120
This is our love show.

612
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,160
We are...

613
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you for watching.

614
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes.

615
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
We didn't fight.

616
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,440
We didn't fight at all.

617
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
We had fun today.

618
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,880
We had so much fun.

619
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,600
I wanted to make something fun of you.

620
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,160
Do you believe it?

621
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,240
No, we don't.

622
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
What do you mean?

623
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,520
Actually,

624
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,800
nothing happened.

625
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,160
But when we were eating,

626
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
we thought

627
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,960
quarreled.

628
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Fighting.

629
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,960
Let's see how you react.

630
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm so touched by Hana's reaction.

631
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,120
You jerk.

632
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
They will be kicked out of the house.

633
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,720
How do you feel about the soup?

634
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,320
Soup.

635
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,800
Shouldn't I be the one who gets hurt the most?

636
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
Who do you think you are?

637
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
I was acting later.

638
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,800
I told her in the middle of the game.

639
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,760
I bumped into them talking.

640
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
I've been coaxing them for a long time.

641
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,280
Then I bumped into them talking.

642
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,920
Then I knew

643
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,080
Then Fatty came back.

644
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
So I acted.

645
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,600
I hope Hua won't beat me to death.

646
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,480
OK.

647
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,440
Done?

648
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Don't hit us.

649
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,560
You lied to me.

650
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,760
Keep lying.

651
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,640
They had a fight today.

652
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,920
No.

653
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
At first, I thought it was an act.

654
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,880
But

655
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,160
you two can act for so long.

656
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
I believe it's true.

657
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,640
Really.

658
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
You can do a boring thing

659
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,680
for so long.

660
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,720
It's really boring.

661
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
It's so awkward.

662
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,680
You didn't expect it, did you?

663
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,400
Not bad.

664
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,760
Your effect is better than I thought.

665
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,360
You're really bad.

666
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,040
When I was most nervous,

667
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,920
when I texted her,

668
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,040
I didn't know who she was going to send it to.

669
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
Then we sat next to her.

670
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,200
I didn't know what she was going to send.

671
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
So I was really nervous and excited.

672
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
I was struggling.

673
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm wandering between Tarri and Fatty.

674
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,880
I'm wondering who to send to.

675
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
I got Susu's (message).

676
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm quite happy.

677
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,880
I sent my message to soup today.

678
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
At the dining table,

679
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
when I was talking to soup,

680
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,720
I asked him if you cut your hair.

681
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,040
Did you cut your hair today?

682
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,720
Yes.

683
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,400
Where did you cut it?

684
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
But honestly,

685
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,160
I didn't see any difference.

686
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,120
Because maybe

687
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,200
he didn't notice that I cut my hair.

688
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
It's the same thing, right?

689
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
I was happy and happy once.

690
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,200
The text is soup.

691
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,440
Send it to Susu.

692
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,760
I think

693
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,880
our relationship is progressing.

694
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,680
and developing in a better direction.

695
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,960
Of course, there's not much space to cross.

696
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
But I think it's good to take it slow.

697
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,040
Actually, when he texted me today,

698
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
I was shocked.

699
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,040
Because I was hesitating

700
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,000
Should I ask him if lemon tea

701
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Is it good?

702
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,960
Then he sent me this message.

703
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,520
I regretted

704
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,120
why I didn't send this message.

705
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,480
What are you doing?

706
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,640
Nothing.

707
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,040
What are you doing?

708
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,280
Harry sent it to me.

709
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,760
The message means

710
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
no matter what happens in the end,

711
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,080
he hopes today is the most unforgettable birthday

712
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,920
in my life.

713
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Finally, he added

714
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,600
He hoped I could take the initiative.

715
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,280
Like he said before,

716
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,360
he thinks I didn't interact with him

717
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,840
I didn't interact with him much.

718
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,800
I didn't talk to him.

719
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,080
He wants me to take more initiative to him.

720
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,320
I'll send it to Tata.

721
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,280
When Tata is with me,

722
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,240
when Tata is with me.

723
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,280
and be myself.

724
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,320
He talks more.

725
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
including body movements.

726
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,920
I think you'll smile more.

727
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,800
I sent Harry

728
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
I sent it to Harry.

729
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,800
Did you receive it?

730
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,160
Did someone send it?

731
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,240
Who sent it?

732
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,760
I got it.

733
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,920
The moment she texted me,

734
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,560
I was really happy.

735
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,960
Because the first two times she texted me,

736
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
for the first two times.

737
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,160
This time he texted me

738
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,640
three and a half texts.

739
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,080
Yes.

740
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,400
Dating Tata

741
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,600
very happy.

742
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
and very happy.

743
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,360
It's not as good as your cooking.

744
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,880
Really?

745
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,080
I want to laugh.

746
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,720
You want to laugh, right?

747
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,720
From the number of words and the content she wrote,

748
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,680
I think she'll be happier.

749
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,120
It's worth doing everything.

750
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,520
Yes.

751
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm sorry for my mistake.

752
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Actually,

753
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,800
The first reaction is that I guess it's a picture.

754
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,720
Because when we pretended to quarrel,

755
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
everyone said you should apologize.

756
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,960
How is it?

757
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
I sent it to Xiaoling today.

758
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,440
And the content is...

759
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
Sorry, I was wrong.

760
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,960
This is actually

761
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,600
when we were acting.

762
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,440
I wrote a letter of apology.

763
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,360
It's been a while.

764
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,760
The map said I wrote a letter of apology.

765
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,760
Then,

766
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
At that moment, I knew

767
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,720
It's just a picture.

768
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
It's too obvious.

769
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,560
And I think

770
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,640
in front of everyone,

771
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,520
in front of everyone.

772
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,680
It's obvious that

773
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,400
I apologized to Xiaoling.

774
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,280
I'll feel fun.

775
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,760
It might attract my interest.

776
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
I want to know more about him.

777
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,840
Tu Tu, have you coaxed Xiao Ling?

778
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,160
Show her the letter.

779
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,840
I just wrote her a letter.

780
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
I have to write 800 words.

781
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,040
I just wrote 1,000 words.

782
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,760
It should be from Xiaoling.

783
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,680
I think our tacit understanding

784
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,240
I think we can

785
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,400
understand each other very well.

786
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,920
I texted Tu.

787
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,040
The content is that we need to improve our acting skills.

788
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,320
Because I think

789
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,280
the big play we played

790
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,480
didn't work well.

791
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,520
What should I do?

792
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,440
Did you tell Hua?

793
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
I hope Hua won't kill me.

794
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,880
OK.

795
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,680
I think we should stop playing.

796
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,280
I feel stressed.

797
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,480
I think I can

798
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,640
point to him that I sent it.

799
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,720
Because I used

800
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,400
we need to improve our acting skills.

801
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,640
Actually I can guess

802
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,760
it was Xin's.

803
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
When I received this message,

804
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,960
I couldn't help

805
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,320
and laugh.

806
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,000
Do you have any questions?

807
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,640
What are you doing?

808
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
Tonight, my message

809
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,440
to Tu.

810
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,560
I sent him an encouragement message.

811
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,400
I sent it to Tu

812
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,680
my brother would be happier.

813
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,800
Later I found he was happier than me.

814
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,560
So happy. I got four.

815
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
The blueprint is out.

816
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,640
Chi-hwa, your noodles are so good.

817
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,440
It's Tae-seo.

818
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
I made him some noodles.

819
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,880
He said it was delicious.

820
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,440
I texted Hwa about my feelings.

821
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
She made me a bowl of noodles.

822
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,480
My bowl is bigger.

823
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
I can clearly feel it today.

824
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,120
I'll observe the flowers subconsciously.

825
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,920
1992.

826
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,000
Action 1996.

827
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,040
I received two text messages today.

828
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,920
At that time,

829
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,440
it sent me one by one.

830
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,560
The first one is "To Flower".

831
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,120
Your noodles are so good.

832
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,920
I thought it was Tae-ri.

833
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,960
I got another one.

834
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,920
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

835
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,600
What do you want to play?

836
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,640
Actually, I guess

837
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm going on a date with Tae-seo tomorrow.

838
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,560
I was thinking.

839
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,480
Did he send me two?

840
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,800
or Fatty?

841
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
I just realized today

842
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,760
I made noodles for him.

843
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,240
I sent it right away when it was time to text him.

844
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,720
It's for Hua.

845
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,480
Texting Hua is indeed

846
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
a change of heart.

847
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Because through tomorrow's date,

848
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,360
I know Hua better.

849
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,800
I've been wondering

850
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,680
who to send this message to.

851
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,720
I've been

852
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,200
between Tae-seo and Fatty.

853
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,240
I might have expectations.

854
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I got Hua's message.

855
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,440
To be honest,

856
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,400
I found that

857
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,520
with Hua,

858
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm very confident.

859
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
Because flowers

860
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
give me a lot of signals.

861
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,560
And I think

862
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm quite confident.

863
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,240
It was obviously Hua.

864
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,720
Then she replied me

865
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,200
She said she could consider teaching me how to fix my face.

866
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,760
I'm quite happy.

867
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,440
This is...

868
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
It shows his feelings.

869
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
And they responded.

870
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,520
GREATFUN

871
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,840
GREATFUN

872
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,760
I sent the message to Fatty.

873
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,240
I didn't know much about Tae-seo today.

874
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,880
But I heard it from Fatty.

875
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,320
He said he wanted to

876
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,680
He must be on his girlfriend's side.

877
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,200
I think I can feel that.

878
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,840
So I think

879
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,920
to him.

880
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,600
Actually, today I feel

881
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,840
my potential competitor is Fatty.

882
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm not going on a date with her tomorrow.

883
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,880
I'll know more about her.

884
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
I feel guilty.

885
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,680
I think Terri

886
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,600
Yeah.

887
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,440
I feel sorry for Tae-seo.

888
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,880
Maybe I've experienced it before.

889
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,600
The guilt

890
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,480
I sent it to someone else.

891
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,640
If others didn't send it to me,

892
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,320
I would be disappointed.

893
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,840
That's why I empathize with Terri's point of view.

894
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,160
I'm disappointed too.

895
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,120
Tarri, do you want to play Yuno later?

896
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,640
Sure.

897
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,240
I didn't receive your message today.

898
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,960
I wouldn't say I was very upset.

899
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,920
I don't think it's necessary.

900
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,520
Today, my brother

901
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,960
received a message.

902
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,160
I think Hua sent it to him.

903
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,200
Hua has been laughing at him these days.

904
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,040
It's like they're just joking.

905
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,720
They seem to interact.

906
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,720
The Zero message of my brother

907
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,560
I went to check on Xinxin.

908
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
She's basically back to normal.

909
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,240
and didn't care about it.

910
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
Tae-seo didn't receive his message.

911
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,040
I was surprised.

912
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
I feel that everyone is still here.

913
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,080
At the beginning,

914
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,000
at the beginning.

915
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,640
Everything is uncertain.

916
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,720
Go write your diary.

917
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,520
Okay.

918
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,120
After a long time, I'll let it go.

919
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm happy to have you

920
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,760
I'm glad to have you as my brother.

921
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,080
We all rely on ourselves

922
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,160
with our own hands.

923
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,240
You didn't change others.

924
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,240
You're just the closest person to me.

925
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,520
So

926
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,280
digest it slowly.

927
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,280
It's not bad now, right?

928
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,440
I hope Hua won't kill me.

929
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,160
OK.

930
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,240
Are you done?

931
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,520
Don't hit us.

932
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,400
You lied to me.

933
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,720
Didn't you realize

934
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,840
in our growth?

935
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,920
You just think you didn't do anything.

936
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,680
But actually,

937
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,360
you actually played a great role.

938
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,120
In my relationship,

939
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
I found out.

940
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,960
So yesterday, I thought

941
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,080
to talk about these things.

942
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,760
I was too anxious.

943
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,520
We didn't fight.

944
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,640
We didn't fight at all.

945
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
We had fun today.

946
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,120
We had so much fun.

947
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,880
I wanted to make something fun of you.

948
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,680
You can do whatever you want.

949
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,400
But the map might think

950
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,000
I guess. I don't know.

951
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,680
Let's forget about it.

952
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,960
Is that so?

953
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,360
Something like that.

954
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,680
If the misunderstanding is resolved,

955
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,640
everything will be fine.

956
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,960
If you come out with me again,

957
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,280
let's play board together.

958
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,960
We have to look at Mr. Tu

959
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Will you give me the chance next time?

960
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,080
Who do you want to work with?

961
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,960
Just tell me.

962
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,040
Can't you see what's inside?

963
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,360
Flowers.

964
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,800
Like this.

965
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,640
What's your name?

966
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,000
Bai.

967
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,880
Yours?

968
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,360
Or...

969
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,520
Really.

970
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,960
It's really mine.

971
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,720
Really.

972
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,480
It's really mine.

973
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,320
I remember

974
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,680
you're walking other people's dog now.

975
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,320
I can take a walk.

976
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,760
We'll shoot later.

977
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
I brought a camera to try it on.

978
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,600
You brought a camera?

979
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,200
Take a look.

980
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,880
Let's go outside

981
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,320
some atmosphere.

982
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,360
Okay.

983
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,520
Over there.

984
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,240
Let me try this first.

985
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,720
to be a photographer.

986
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,840
I'll see how you're doing.

987
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
You'll be fined if you don't do well.

988
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Three, two, one.

989
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,720
It's pretty.

990
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,080
Awesome.

991
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,840
Good.

992
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,560
What pose?

993
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,840
Yes, like this.

994
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,240
Smile.

995
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,760
So classy.

996
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,600
I've gained some weight.

997
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,360
Really?

998
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,080
Really

999
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,640
Really?

1000
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,240
Yes.

1001
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,440
It's okay. Happiness is the most important.

1002
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,840
Let me tell you a trick.

1003
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,280
Take a breath before shooting.

1004
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,480
You need to smile.

1005
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,760
Yes, really.

1006
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,280
It's very useful. It's very useful.

1007
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,960
Three, two, one.

1008
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,680
Exhale.

1009
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,240
I vomited.

1010
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,120
Look, this is how you smile naturally.

1011
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,160
Right?

1012
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,680
The smile of the heroine.

1013
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,200
Let me take a picture for you.

1014
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,320
Three, two, one.

1015
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,560
Good.

1016
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,960
This one is amazing.

1017
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, I did.

1018
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,200
That's because you're pretty.

1019
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,000
Then you stand

1020
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,640
Stand here and take a look.

1021
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
Yes, look up there.

1022
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,640
Pretend to be very atmosphere.

1023
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,160
Three, two, one.

1024
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,200
Spit out the fairy aura.

1025
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,960
Your profile is amazing.

1026
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,600
Let me see.

1027
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
This is too obvious.

1028
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,280
My profile looks like this.

1029
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,680
I want a hair lamp.

1030
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,160
You...

1031
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,360
Here.

1032
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,920
Okay, try it.

1033
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,680
Have a look. Yes.

1034
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:16,920
Yes.

1035
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,600
Three.

1036
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,120
It's okay.

1037
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,400
Three, two, one.

1038
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Try it. I'll stand there.

1039
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:26,960
It's cold.

1040
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,560
It's okay here.

1041
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,960
Okay, let's go in.

1042
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,440
Sure.

1043
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,080
It's too cold.

1044
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
You haven't put on your socks.

1045
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,000
Let's go.

1046
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,800
Let's go.

1047
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,320
Let's go.

1048
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,920
It's cold.

1049
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,600
I want to use the Mirror Room.

1050
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,720
because I have

1051
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,000
with the drawing.

1052
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm curious about him.

1053
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,200
and ask him some questions.

1054
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,080
But I don't think

1055
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,560
to ask this question face to face.

1056
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,160
It might be awkward.

1057
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Then I'll use the Mirror Room.

1058
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,480
Good evening.

1059
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:38,960
Good evening.

1060
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
I want to know

1061
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,880
in the house.

1062
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,520
Who do you want to choose first?

1063
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,440
Xinxin.

1064
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,080
I think Xinxin is like my brother.

1065
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,400
You said she looks like your brother.

1066
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,600
What do you mean?

1067
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,720
She's like a bosom friend.

1068
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,520
Yes.

1069
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,840
What about Hua?

1070
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,160
I think Hua

1071
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,000
very considerate

1072
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,320
He's also very considerate.

1073
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,880
Sometimes he's funny.

1074
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,080
What about Susu?

1075
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,920
Susu is very timid.

1076
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,080
But sometimes she would

1077
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,480
something

1078
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,840
that you may not see.

1079
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,760
to others.

1080
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,480
What about Xiaoling?

1081
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,920
I think she's...

1082
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,120
Why do you smile

1083
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
you should smile.

1084
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,640
Because...

1085
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,680
I don't know

1086
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,360
She is a very relaxed

1087
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,560
She's very happy

1088
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,760
We get along very well.

1089
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,000
and get along well.

1090
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,080
What about Tata?

1091
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,480
I think everyone is very relaxed.

1092
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,720
Tata has a different point

1093
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,040
she won't say something.

1094
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,880
but she might

1095
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,600
hidden in her heart.

1096
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,600
I think he might have

1097
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,040
Maybe

1098
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,760
there are some other ingredients that are interested in.

1099
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,480
Because he also said

1100
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,640
when they were playing in the world of ice,

1101
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,760
they cooperated well.

1102
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,680
And they have something to talk about.

1103
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,560
The girls you dated before

1104
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,920
including the ice exercise.

1105
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,000
what do you think the difference is?

1106
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,800
The first one is Xinxin.

1107
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,280
I think during the date,

1108
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,560
she was very considerate.

1109
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,160
She takes the initiative

1110
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,400
and ask you some questions.

1111
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,200
Tata is

1112
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,600
who will work hard

1113
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,440
and fight for.

1114
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,960
And Xiao Ling.

1115
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,360
We went skiing together.

1116
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,520
We had a great time

1117
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,920
during skiing.

1118
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,120
And he often teases me.

1119
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,080
He'll be very relaxed and happy.

1120
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,760
If a man

1121
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,280
to invite you on a date,

1122
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,320
what kind of place

1123
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,560
Which type?

1124
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,720
Outdoor

1125
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,760
More to experience

1126
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,840
where we go on dates.

1127
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,560
Aren't you afraid of the cold in winter?

1128
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,520
I'm fine.

1129
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,280
It was very cold that day.

1130
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,600
But I was happy

1131
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,360
I think I can exercise or something

1132
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,800
can resist the cold on me.

1133
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,600
I don't know who the opponent is,

1134
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,880
to ask me this question,

1135
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,160
But all the questions I answer are

1136
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,320
more questions about Xiaoling.

1137
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,680
My words and words

1138
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,320
are all around her.

1139
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,840
Do you think

1140
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,360
love at first sight and love grows over time?

1141
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,400
Which would you choose?

1142
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,080
I used to choose love at first sight.

1143
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,480
But now I prefer

1144
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,480
love after love.

1145
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,400
So complicated.

1146
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,960
It's love that grows over time.

1147
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,320
is more than love at first sight.

1148
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,960
Okay.

1149
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,280
What do you think

1150
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,520
is attractive to you?

1151
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,320
Smile.

1152
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,480
And

1153
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,920
you like people who smile.

1154
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,800
No.

1155
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,720
I'm still thinking

1156
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,560
I can't tell

1157
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,120
about others.

1158
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,960
But I will follow my emotions

1159
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,480
and feelings.

1160
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,920
You want me to tell you

1161
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,120
what kind of person I like.

1162
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,440
what I like.

1163
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,680
Do you think the outgoing of the opposite sex

1164
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,320
will affect your feelings for her?

1165
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,360
I like her more.

1166
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,200
Sometimes I'm introverted.

1167
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Sometimes she's outgoing.

1168
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,520
She can tell the occasions clearly.

1169
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,240
who can differentiate the occasions.

1170
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,520
That's all my questions.

1171
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,720
You can leave now.

1172
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,400
Thank you.

1173
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,240
OK.

1174
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,360
I think as a whole,

1175
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,440
he's very sincere.

1176
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,000
He didn't hide his feelings.

1177
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think what I value the most is

1178
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,280
whether he is sincere or not.

1179
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,080
There's a saying,

1180
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,600
sincerity is the ultimate move.

1181
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,920
So he can face me sincerely

1182
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,480
and give me an answer.

1183
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,520
I think

1184
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,320
touched me.

1185
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,000
I think it's Xiaoling's problem.

1186
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,280
In that tone,

1187
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,960
and the questions she asked,

1188
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,800
I think it should be her.

1189
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,120
What are you doing?

1190
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,280
This is the first time we have so many people here.

1191
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,320
Sorry, I took your bed.

1192
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,200
It's okay. Have a seat.

1193
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,920
What are you doing?

1194
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,720
We're talking.

1195
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,920
The way of survival.

1196
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,720
Then take me to your dorm.

1197
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,080
What are you doing?

1198
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,760
Take me there.

1199
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,040
What are you doing?

1200
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,640
Open it.

1201
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,520
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to go in directly.

1202
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,280
Linlin!

1203
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,640
Nobody!

1204
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,160
What are you doing?

1205
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,080
Nothing.

1206
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,600
Are you looking for her?

1207
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,680
Yes, I'm fine.

1208
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,720
Xiao Ling is back.

1209
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,800
Where are you?

1210
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,600
I'm upstairs.

1211
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,560
I'm receiving

1212
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,720
Today, your brothers

1213
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,800
received two sincere texts.

1214
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,080
My first reaction was

1215
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,440
That's my reaction.

1216
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:22,880
No.

1217
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,240
I must...

1218
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:23,920
What was that text message?

1219
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Who sent it to him?

1220
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,600
That's all I can think of.

1221
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,040
Then I brought yesterday

1222
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,360
I saw him in a bad mood.

1223
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,200
So I said

1224
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,960
I wanted to see if I could apply for a sibling house.

1225
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,880
Then I applied immediately

1226
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,200
to ask him immediately.

1227
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,960
This is not comfortable.

1228
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,360
I'll sit next time.

1229
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,600
I saw you received two texts today.

1230
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,920
First, Xin told me to cheer for something.

1231
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,280
Don't be too tense.

1232
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,040
I'm the oldest sister.

1233
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,160
Who did you receive?

1234
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,680
I guess it's a map.

1235
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,720
Because today,

1236
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,680
we took a photo

1237
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,560
at night.

1238
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,040
I sent it to the map.

1239
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,720
The content I sent him is

1240
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,760
He's good at taking photos.

1241
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,640
He sent me to take more photos.

1242
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,640
So I think it can match.

1243
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:28,960
Good.

1244
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,840
So are you happy skiing?

1245
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,080
Yes.

1246
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,560
Really?

1247
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,160
Yes.

1248
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,560
I'm going to kill both of you.

1249
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,680
So you were really fooled.

1250
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,560
Of course.

1251
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,480
I thought you'd become weird.

1252
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,120
You weren't so hard to let him go before.

1253
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,160
You should let others go easily.

1254
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,720
Why did you...

1255
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,880
I saw you were in a bad mood.

1256
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
The photo album of Tata?

1257
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,560
Yes.

1258
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,360
His brother?

1259
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,240
Yes.

1260
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,600
Then why did you...

1261
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,200
I think I misunderstood.

1262
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,440
What?

1263
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,160
Did she tell you

1264
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,400
Did she tell you about this?

1265
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,400
We talked during dinner.

1266
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,600
What did she say?

1267
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
She said she was just supporting me.

1268
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,000
So you're better now.

1269
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,640
No.

1270
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,440
I think

1271
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,960
I might have thought too much.

1272
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,160
Will you still think about this?

1273
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
Or are you going to...

1274
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,120
I don't think so.

1275
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:25,960
I think so too.

1276
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,720
it's not good to push yourself and her too hard.

1277
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,480
So you want to relax.

1278
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,240
Relax.

1279
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,360
Take your time.

1280
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
What does Susu usually talk about

1281
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,760
talk to you?

1282
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,800
More things about you

1283
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,480
or more related to her?

1284
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,440
If she asks me, ask me.

1285
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,240
But she just...

1286
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,720
I think she's just bored.

1287
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,360
Maybe she's not bad.

1288
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,400
But I think Fatty is right.

1289
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,120
In a few days,

1290
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,920
in a few days.

1291
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,000
If someone brakes, you'll know who it is.

1292
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,400
He pushed himself too hard.

1293
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,760
It should be fine.

1294
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,520
Relax.

1295
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,080
Eat more ice cream with me.

1296
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,920
What's your plan now?

1297
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,600
Just stay like this?

1298
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,480
No, I think so too.

1299
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,160
I was very tense with her.

1300
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,200
It's too formal.

1301
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,760
It doesn't matter to be happy and relaxed.

1302
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,040
If you say so, can you do it?

1303
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,080
Try it.

1304
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
I feel okay

1305
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,520
I just know what to do.

1306
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,440
It's much easier.

1307
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,640
It's actually useful to talk to Fatty.

1308
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,560
Who said that?

1309
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,160
Don't push yourself and Susu too hard.

1310
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,280
If you take everything too seriously,

1311
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,160
the girl will be nervous too.

1312
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,040
It seems to be Xinxin.

1313
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,560
Yes.

1314
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,320
Just relax.

1315
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,200
I feel the mood of the soup

1316
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,280
It feels like being dragged.

1317
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,800
When someone says something,

1318
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,480
he will be unhappy.

1319
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,440
When others say the second thing,

1320
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,760
he would be happy.

1321
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,240
I don't think

1322
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,560
for himself.

1323
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,480
He also realized it.

1324
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,040
Don't be so nervous.

1325
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,560
and

1326
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,360
pay more attention to your own things.

1327
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,760
Thanks to Fatty and Xinxin.

1328
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,400
They gave good advice.

1329
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,360
So I think

1330
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,040
can be successfully solved.

1331
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,480
Because I think the soup

1332
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,000
pay more attention to your feelings.

1333
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,160
What do you think of Tu Man?

1334
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,840
Sometimes I'm not decisive.

1335
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,320
Do you want to do something or love?

1336
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,960
or...

1337
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,520
All of them.

1338
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,160
You're quite decisive about love.

1339
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,480
I remember once

1340
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,960
when we played the piano there,

1341
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,200
someone asked him

1342
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,120
if Tata is him.

1343
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,360
fall in love at first sight?

1344
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,480
He said

1345
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,120
Tata is you.

1346
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,800
you would like at first sight?

1347
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,800
I think so.

1348
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,880
Then someone asked him

1349
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,360
the snowy day.

1350
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,040
someone asked

1351
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,960
if he had a crush on the tower that day.

1352
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,960
He said he was playing the big tire.

1353
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,840
When it slipped,

1354
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,920
Tata looked back and smiled at him.

1355
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,320
He said he was moved at that moment.

1356
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,160
And I still remember that.

1357
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,720
So I...

1358
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,520
Let me see.

1359
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,840
It's okay.

1360
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,080
I think it's normal to meet many people.

1361
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,920
But

1362
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,120
you think too much.

1363
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,280
I said I don't have internal consumption.

1364
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,320
But I think

1365
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
I think it's okay.

1366
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,800
Let's keep getting along.

1367
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,640
and give him more recognition.

1368
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,320
and see how he will react.

1369
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,920
One more thing is

1370
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,600
I guess

1371
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,680
Tu Tu may be a few years younger than me.

1372
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,560
So what?

1373
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,080
I think about it.

1374
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,320
No need.

1375
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,840
You're silent.

1376
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,280
Isn't it good

1377
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,360
Isn't that good?

1378
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,880
But I think boys

1379
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,400
become mature later.

1380
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,800
What do you mean?

1381
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,560
You're afraid he won't smile after two years?

1382
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,800
No.

1383
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,480
I'm afraid.

1384
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,400
I'm wondering if I'll be...

1385
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,840
What are you thinking about?

1386
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,920
Just enjoy the process.

1387
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,640
And you're not in a relationship.

1388
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,840
You're just getting to know each other.

1389
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,480
Okay.

1390
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,480
Okay.

1391
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,400
Let's go.

1392
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,040
Bye.

1393
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,520
Cheer up.

1394
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,920
I'm happy.

1395
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,840
You should be happier.

1396
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Me too.

1397
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,520
I was talking about this with Hua.

1398
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,880
She thought she asked me

1399
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,120
if I was totally passive,

1400
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,200
I won't fight for it.

1401
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,400
I said I would try.

1402
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,320
But I want to see the attitude of a man.

1403
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,240
First, I don't like blurry boys.

1404
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,320
But if he's already straight,

1405
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,160
tell you,

1406
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,800
I won't fight for it.

1407
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,400
I see.

1408
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,640
Don't you think so?

1409
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,760
I don't know.

1410
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,480
I know nothing about love now.

1411
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,160
Will you fight for it?

1412
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,520
I don't think I can.

1413
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,960
I'm better at reading men's attitude.

1414
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,480
Yes.

1415
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,360
Right, right?

1416
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,360
I think so.

1417
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,280
I'm very interested.

1418
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,240
Because I'm not a good person.

1419
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,800
I'm easy to judge people.

1420
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,200
Me too.

1421
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,120
I'll die.

1422
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,080
Maybe I found something wrong at the beginning,

1423
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,880
I'll shoot him to death.

1424
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,520
Me too.

1425
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,840
No, we can't do this.

1426
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,040
We need to know more about each other.

1427
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,160
That's right.

1428
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,400
Take action.

1429
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,680
Take action, Xinxin.

1430
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,840
It's hard to understand.

1431
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,560
I want to write a diary too.

1432
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,280
Here's a pen.

1433
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,400
Okay.

1434
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,480
It's actually useful to talk to Fatty.

1435
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,400
Who said that?

1436
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,000
Don't push yourself and Susu too hard.

1437
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,120
If you take everything too seriously,

1438
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,000
the girl will be nervous too.

1439
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,520
In fact, you can have beef meatball soup if you're hungry.

1440
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
I think it's okay.

1441
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,480
I think it's too virtuous.

1442
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,760
I'll marry myself if I'm a woman.

1443
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,240
I'll bring them some.

1444
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,160
Let me do it.

1445
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,960
It's okay.

1446
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,680
I want to bring a gift too.

1447
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,560
Place it right.

1448
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,120
You do it.

1449
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,280
Seven.

1450
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,760
Eight.

1451
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,760
I'll stand here.

1452
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,480
It's windy here.

1453
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,440
I'll block the wind for you.

1454
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,400
Okay, thank you.

1455
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,200
The soup is very angry.

1456
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Very angry

1457
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,720
Why?

1458
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,320
Then I asked why.

1459
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,520
It's because of you.

1460
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
No, there are too many misunderstandings.

1461
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,880
Okay.

1462
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,960
Do you miss me?

1463
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,720
What?

1464
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,440
Do you miss me?

1465
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,200
Yes.

1466
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,840
Here, shrimp skating.

1467
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,160
They are all flowers.

1468
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,080
Catch me.

1469
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,840
Go ahead.

1470
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,280
Take cold water.

1471
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:04,960
Hurry.

1472
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,120
I'm a little jealous about that.

1473
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,560
What?

1474
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,200
You are very serious.

1475
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,400
He's not very serious.

1476
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,960
He's quite possessive.

1477
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,320
He's too strong to make himself unhappy.

1478
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,480
I think I've felt it.

1479
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,840
Right? Because you will

1480
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,960
in this game.

1481
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,360
He likes to use backhand.

1482
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,240
Do you know why?

1483
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,240
Easy.

1484
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,600
He looks handsome with backhand.

1485
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,240
Handsome.

1486
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,000
I always want to

1487
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,360
in front of you.

1488
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,600
It's been a week since the little house.

1489
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,320
They went on a Cupid date.

1490
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,800
and protected their dates.

1491
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,680
The beginning of understanding has passed.

1492
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,480
Some people's feelings are getting warmer.

1493
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,240
and some have changed.

1494
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,120
Now there are three people.

1495
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,880
Flowers, Tarri and Chubby.

1496
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,320
Yes.

1497
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,360
People will think

1498
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,520
at this point, for a week,

1499
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,320
whether you know enough about someone

1500
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,720
to make a judgment.

1501
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,800
It's hard to make a complete judgment.

1502
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,200
Not enough.

1503
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,080
I can't understand.

1504
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,240
Some people have spent their lives together

1505
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,800
they don't know each other.

1506
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,640
That's what I want to say.

1507
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,400
You can see through someone in a second.

1508
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,560
right?

1509
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,320
Yes.

1510
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,800
But I think

1511
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,000
because they've been together day and night,

1512
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,520
so it's okay to confirm their feelings.

1513
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,920
At least 80 percent sure

1514
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,040
whether I'm interested in this person

1515
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,000
or not.

1516
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,240
This should be relatively clear.

1517
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,760
High concentration.

1518
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,920
Yes.

1519
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,800
Whether one week is enough or not,

1520
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,840
in love,

1521
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,480
Don't think about where the destination is.

1522
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,240
Just love bravely.
