1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,080
Beauty.

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,280
Yuanyuan.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,360
Legend of the nation.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,320
Feng Feng.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,440
Feng Xu.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It feels like there's a wild wine at a party.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a chance to get a surprise reward.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,240
Can I sit here?

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,360
All of you, eat the gossip, right?

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Wait.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,400
So many people.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm not chatting with you here.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
Sit here for a while.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
Let's go upstairs.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Leave it to them.

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
It's spicy.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
Do you want water?

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
Thank you.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
It's spicy.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Let's go.

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,320
You're not eating?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,280
Sit here.

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:47,360
A House of Feelings.

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,560
Actually...

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,320
Say something.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,079
Actually...

32
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,160
Say something.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
I asked Harry last night.

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,240
Because I want to get close to

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,160
to get close to her,

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
or even hold her hand.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
I asked Harry,

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,520
if I had

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
with Su Su,

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,200
Will she be very uncomfortable?

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,760
Actually, I didn't ask him to ask you.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
I...

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
He didn't ask me.

44
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,440
But when I came back today,

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,320
you were at the dining table.

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
Didn't he ask you?

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
No, he didn't.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Did he say you had physical contact?

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
I said no.

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,120
What I heard was...

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,280
Tell me.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
What does it have to do with me?

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,960
Well, I think...

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
No.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
I didn't say anything.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,480
Really?

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,320
He didn't even ask this question.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,440
You really...

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I really...

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
You're here.

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,600
has nothing to do

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,320
has anything to do with me?

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,640
He didn't talk to you about

64
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,080
what I told you yesterday.

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
he said something.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
A House of Feelings.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
I didn't say anything.

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,520
He didn't ask this question.

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
What were you talking about at the dining table?

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,320
Is there any progress?

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,279
any physical contact?

72
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,320
Like...

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,959
I said no.

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,120
I might hear

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,480
the details of our date.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
You may

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
some of my mistakes

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,000
as a joke to them.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,840
You think my behaviour is ridiculous.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,240
I don't think you're funny.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Why do I think you're ridiculous?

82
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,280
First,

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,200
I don't take it as a joke.

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,720
I just want to express my feelings.

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
And I don't know

86
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,600
you could still hear it from so far away.

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,080
I don't think

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,720
it's funny.

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
I didn't know he heard that.

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,200
And I think

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
he might have heard it wrong.

92
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
Did the date fail?

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
Did you two make any progress?

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,520
You really...

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
have to do with me?

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,360
Because

97
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,840
in the way we get along,

98
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
we always make some heavy things

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,480
some serious things

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,840
to express it.

101
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,800
He might think what I said

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
or mocking him.

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,800
But I didn't think of that at all.

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
I didn't mean that.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
A House of Feelings.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
What do you think I did wrong

107
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
or something else,

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,760
you can tell me.

109
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
Even if you and Harry

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,000
You two can complain about it.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
It's not good if Tata is here.

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
I don't care at all.

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,440
But you told me

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,400
you're actually very sensitive.

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,480
You care about others' feelings

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,560
than your own feelings.

117
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
I think after coming back today,

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,280
you didn't

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,920
care about your feelings.

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,000
You didn't consider my feelings at all.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,520
I don't know.

122
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
I thought it was nothing

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
on my way back.

124
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,760
But they asked me

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,640
After that, I said,

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,160
The more I said, the more I felt wronged.

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
The more I say it, the more I feel nothing is right.

128
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,000
I wanted to cry when I was on the table.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,880
But I thought there were many people.

130
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,360
You were there too.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,520
Then I made a joke

132
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
in a joke.

133
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't want to make it too serious.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,920
or

135
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
I need someone to comfort me

136
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
or something like that.

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Then,

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,400
So I called them up later.

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Actually, I didn't want to invite them up.

140
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,760
I just want to find Harry.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
But Harry and Tata

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
with Tata.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,480
Then I can only

144
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,360
to both of them.

145
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,320
and tell them how I feel.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,040
Maybe after I said it,

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
after I said it.

148
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,960
and made Harry angry.

149
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,760
He thought

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,520
wasted his chance

151
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,800
or something.

152
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I feel sorry for them.

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,080
And I think

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,840
I can't feel many things.

155
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,320
The two key points

156
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,120
the two key points of our chat

157
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
I don't feel it.

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Not proactive enough.

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,640
If you don't take the initiative, you don't like it enough.

160
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
You mean in Cat Cafe?

161
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
Yes.

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,640
A House of Feelings.

163
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,720
I think a good relationship

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,360
is a bonus.

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
When two people are together,

166
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,840
more happy

167
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
than being alone.

168
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,360
more comfortable and happier.

169
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,840
instead of

170
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,040
burden.

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,360
A House of Feelings.

172
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Actually, when she cries,

173
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,080
I wanted to comfort her.

174
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,480
But I don't know how to do it.

175
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,800
So I think I didn't do it well.

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,080
In my way of life or

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,840
compared to my old self,

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm already very active.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
So I want to ask you

180
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,840
what kind of state

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,080
you want.

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
It doesn't mean

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,080
you can become

184
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,840
what I want you to be.

185
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,360
This is not the real you.

186
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm also confused.

187
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,280
I don't know

188
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,880
how to take the initiative in the next development.

189
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,480
Because we know each other.

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,680
I don't know what I can ask you.

191
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,520
There's nothing I want to know.

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,840
That's why.

193
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
Because you think we know enough.

194
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,160
I think I really want to ask you

195
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,840
about three views.

196
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
But these things often involve

197
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,280
related to family.

198
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,560
If I asked you,

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
you answered me,

200
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,760
But I didn't answer you when you asked me.

201
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,840
I think it's impolite.

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,720
But I don't want to talk about

203
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,160
about my family in the show.

204
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,720
If we can't talk about life and values,

205
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,280
we can only

206
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,760
your opinion on certain things.

207
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
I'll try to understand you.

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
He has a sense of boundary.

209
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
So boundary.

210
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,560
Actually, I don't know

211
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,600
what I should know about you.

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
I can talk about what I've changed

213
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
after I came here.

214
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,440
Actually chatting with Fatty

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
with Fatty.

216
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
I didn't know you two had a chat.

217
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,920
Maybe he just wanted me

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
to try to relax.

219
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Will you

220
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,120
When I'm free and you're free,

221
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
when I'm free?

222
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
You never came to me.

223
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,960
Because I don't know if you're willing.

224
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,400
Because of me.

225
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,760
Why didn't you ask?

226
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm afraid you'd be embarrassed to say no.

227
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,320
But you don't like it.

228
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,320
Well...

229
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,960
I think it's okay to ask now.

230
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,840
I thought

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
I thought you drank water.

232
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
I said you can drink so much.

233
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,640
Okay.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
I think I've already taken the initiative.

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm too proactive.

236
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,480
I hate myself.

237
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,280
What?

238
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
I should be

239
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
in real life.

240
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,800
More boring.

241
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,200
I've never taken the initiative.

242
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Growing up

243
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Almost.

244
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
But you are a boy.

245
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm a girl.

246
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
Okay.

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm trying to change.

248
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,680
I didn't see it.

249
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Su Zihao told me

250
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
he talked a lot with you every day.

251
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
He asked you to take the initiative every day.

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
But you didn't change at all.

253
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,720
You only care about your feelings.

254
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
You don't care about my feelings.

255
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,040
That's all.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,360
I only care about my feelings.

257
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
I just told you

258
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,680
I adopted a stray dog.

259
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Say hello.

260
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,880
Next second you ask me

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,320
Do you still have a dog?

262
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
You really don't care what I say.

263
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,440
I didn't know

264
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,520
The left ear goes in the right ear

265
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,560
or left ear?

266
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,040
before it goes in.

267
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,400
I'll focus 100 percent from now on.

268
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,880
No, I just feel that you're distracted.

269
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,040
I was wondering why there were so many cameras.

270
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Yes.

271
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
So we can't be immersed in it.

272
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,520
That's what we should do, right?

273
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
But...

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
on the day we played ping-pong,

275
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,720
there were many cameras.

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,640
Maybe in the familiar environment,

277
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,040
And my teacher is here.

278
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,480
Actually,

279
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,880
I think he's more like my parent.

280
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,960
for three years.

281
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,520
In an environment,

282
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,720
in an environment,

283
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,680
I might relaxed.

284
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,360
Maybe I haven't been to Cat Cafe much.

285
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I don't know what to do.

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
Because you are not immersed,

287
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
so I won't be immersed.

288
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,960
Because it's mutual.

289
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
No date is

290
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,720
One is happy and the other is unhappy.

291
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,480
You can't do this.

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,440
It's usually

293
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
the same.

294
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,600
Right?

295
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,800
Su Zihao told me

296
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
you said

297
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,880
some physical contact.

298
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,920
You pulled me.

299
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,400
I think

300
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,880
you're showing it to him.

301
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
You showed him that you're completing the mission.

302
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
You're doing a mission.

303
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
Brother.

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,880
I...

305
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm afraid you'll dislike it.

306
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,680
That's what I think.

307
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,160
Stop it.

308
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,840
How about tomorrow?

309
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,280
I have something to do tomorrow.

310
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,040
I'm sorry you can't see me.

311
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,720
I have to get out of here.

312
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Okay.

313
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,680
Okay.

314
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,520
Can I say you're not allowed to leave?

315
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
Are you the boss?

316
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,840
What about the day after tomorrow?

317
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
Think about it the day after tomorrow.

318
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
Okay.

319
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,360
She won't come back tomorrow.

320
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,120
She means

321
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,200
you should take the initiative now.

322
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,960
Really.

323
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,000
Why do you have so much

324
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
have so much to say?

325
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,080
I don't know. Maybe he talks too much.

326
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
I talk a lot too.

327
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,800
I talk a lot too.

328
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,280
I only reply when he says three sentences to me.

329
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,480
I'll ask him.

330
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
Why is he so talkative?

331
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,320
Let me learn philosophy.

332
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I think

333
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,040
in this situation,

334
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,760
Su Zihao is willing to

335
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,680
talk to you every day

336
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,920
or answer questions

337
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,960
or something like that.

338
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,160
or we have some misunderstandings.

339
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,800
through him.

340
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,560
But we won't have people like him anymore.

341
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,920
It's okay. I won't talk to him anymore.

342
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,480
I'll talk to you directly.

343
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,560
But without him,

344
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,400
where would I go

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
get your real thoughts.

346
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,600
I can't imagine

347
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,040
Without him,

348
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,080
we might...

349
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,560
Maybe...

350
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
it's impossible.

351
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,800
Maybe I won't send it to you on the first day.

352
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,840
Maybe.

353
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
If you don't mind, I'll go to you.

354
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Wait for another two days.

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,600
He thinks

356
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,280
he's already

357
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,520
is doing his best.

358
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,960
He's already the one

359
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,000
or the most.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
is different from before.

361
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,200
But I'm still not satisfied.

362
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,040
I hope he will take the initiative.

363
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,360
I hope he can change.

364
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,600
What changes?

365
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,400
I think

366
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,760
if you like someone,

367
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
I might need to make some changes.

368
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
Maybe I didn't feel

369
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
I didn't feel it.

370
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,080
I want to try

371
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
to make a breakthrough.

372
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
and take the initiative.

373
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Do you think

374
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,080
the relationship between people

375
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
develop?

376
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,680
You can start physical contact.

377
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,400
As long as the atmosphere is here.

378
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Why do you think so much

379
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,000
You can hold her if you want.

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,040
Do you think she likes you?

381
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,640
I think it's okay.

382
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,400
Like myself.

383
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,720
At that time,

384
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,960
because I was going to study in Australia.

385
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,040
I think there are a few days left.

386
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,920
Just a few days.

387
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,520
So I'm in a hurry.

388
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm going to make a breakthrough.

389
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Movie theater?

390
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Yes.

391
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,400
I must hold her hand

392
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,160
and have the courage

393
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,240
to do this.

394
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,680
Because this is actually a brand.

395
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
As long as we hold hands,

396
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
it means

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,800
our relationship will go further.

398
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,760
and more stable.

399
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,240
You'll feel more at ease, right?

400
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Yes.

401
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,960
Because if he goes to hold her hand,

402
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
if she dumps our sister,

403
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Zun probably won't go to school.

404
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
People like soup

405
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,520
is quite typical.

406
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,280
In a relationship,

407
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,600
in love.

408
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
What kind of advice do you think

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
to make them feel that I'm taking the initiative?

410
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Actually, I think

411
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,560
it's normal to like someone.

412
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,160
You can't help but approach him.

413
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,040
So he told Fatty

414
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
I couldn't help getting close to her, Guolifang.

415
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,680
and pursue her.

416
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,640
But this thing...

417
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,720
She likes you and you like her.

418
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,760
I think this is the most important.

419
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,839
Then take the initiative to hold hands.

420
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,280
not like me.

421
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,440
I'm going to Australia in a few days.

422
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,200
Yes, we don't have much time.

423
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,119
They have time.

424
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,040
we can discuss this.

425
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,000
For example, when girls

426
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,560
with a man,

427
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,119
you will feel

428
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,200
when you have ripples in your heart,

429
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
you would want

430
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,880
to hold your hand or something.

431
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,200
But that guy hasn't done anything.

432
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,839
What will happen?

433
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
He'll take the initiative anyway.

434
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,680
Because I know his personality.

435
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,320
When it's time,

436
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,880
I know his personality. He's slow to warm up.

437
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah.

438
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,600
And I hope

439
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,760
our relationship can be warmed up.

440
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
It's okay to take the initiative.

441
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Just create a relaxing atmosphere.

442
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,440
For example, when I meet someone like you,

443
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm a girl. I'll take the initiative.

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Really?

445
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,360
Because I know you are more passive.

446
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,080
right?

447
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,040
But I'm in a corner you can't see.

448
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,520
I took the initiative.

449
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,480
You came here directly.

450
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,760
Yes, that's it.

451
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,360
Bro

452
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,040
That's it.

453
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,160
I think Susu is not satisfied with the soup.

454
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
I don't think it's because

455
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,760
physical contact.

456
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,600
I think

457
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,120
she hopes that when she wakes up early,

458
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,280
a bowl of noodles for Susu

459
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
or even boiled boiled eggs.

460
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
I think it's also a proactive performance.

461
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,120
For the soup,

462
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,000
at this stage,

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,560
he felt something was wrong.

464
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,280
So he decided not to do it.

465
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,960
What he needs is

466
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
to take every step that belongs to him.

467
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,080
You rejected my date, right?

468
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,000
Sit here and talk.

469
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,280
Don't you think

470
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,280
Aren't you weird?

471
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,160
About what?

472
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,720
After that,

473
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
I wrote it in the next second.

474
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
How do you want others to do it?

475
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,080
I mean I respect your choice.

476
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
You can refuse.

477
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,640
I didn't say anything.

478
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,840
No, I didn't refuse because...

479
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,920
It's not because...

480
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
I thought you didn't write that letter.

481
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,200
That's why I refused.

482
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,160
You think I didn't write that letter?

483
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,800
Yes.

484
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,240
Who wrote it for you?

485
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
I think

486
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,320
might not be a misunderstanding.

487
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
but bad information.

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,680
We never

489
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,360
sit down and talk.

490
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,280
Let's go.

491
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Where are we going?

492
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,040
Let's talk.

493
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,080
You've always been like this.

494
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,520
Why? Why do you think I didn't write it?

495
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,920
Because your words and actions are different.

496
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,840
It begins.

497
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,240
You're not very...

498
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,720
I think anyone

499
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
can say that I'm inconsistent.

500
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,400
But you can't say that I'm inconsistent.

501
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Where is the point?

502
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,520
I told you yesterday

503
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,960
I didn't approve

504
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,440
your explanation in the room.

505
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,600
I even thought

506
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,240
I felt like I was led.

507
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,560
I think you're quite stupid.

508
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
They are always aggressive when they meet.

509
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
The atmosphere is totally different.

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,360
Think about it.

511
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,120
Let's check the timeline.

512
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,360
The next day I came,

513
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
That means I have a good impression.

514
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,600
The next day,

515
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,480
it was you.

516
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,040
I actually sent it to you on the first day.

517
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,720
The one you sent on the first day was me.

518
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,120
I understand your elephant.

519
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,360
You didn't text me on the first day.

520
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,200
The next day.

521
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,320
The next day is like

522
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
the first day.

523
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,120
Is it you?

524
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,160
It's me.

525
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,520
I sent you the next day.

526
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
Yes.

527
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,800
When we were on a date,

528
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,960
we reached a consensus

529
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,400
to meet new people?

530
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,440
Right?

532
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,040
Yes.

533
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Your elephant.

534
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,000
I know your elephant.

535
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
So the next day,

536
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
Tarri and Tata entered.

537
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
The third day.

538
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

539
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
Yes, and I sent it to Tata.

540
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,640
You sent it to Terri.

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,120
Yes, the sports day.

542
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,560
But you didn't contact Tata.

543
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
You sent it to Tata at night?

544
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,360
I did.

545
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,000
You were with Xiaoling during the sports day.

546
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
How do you get in touch with her?

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,480
The first man Tata met was me.

548
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,280
I know your elephant.

549
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
I know your elephant.

550
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't let me listen to it.

551
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
Because I actually have an answer in my heart.

552
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,840
Just write a letter

553
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Romantic house

554
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
The misunderstanding between Fatty and her

555
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
between Fatty and her.

556
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
instead of

557
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,720
Hua wants to get closer to Fatty

558
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,520
with Fatty

559
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
and develop.

560
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
I just want to verify my answer.

561
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
I don't think so.

562
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,360
Didn't you notice that

563
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
after the sports day?

564
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,920
I didn't see it.

565
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
your mouth

566
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
You said you came to our wedding.

567
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,200
and then with Xiao Ling.

568
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
If you're the one who got Xiao Ling,

569
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,840
I'm willing to do it.

570
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
I think you're "poisonous".

571
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,360
It's my fault.

572
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,200
I have a mouth.

573
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,320
Yes, I think you're "poisonous".

574
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,920
And you...

575
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,360
But you've been following Xiaoling.

576
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,280
Xiao Ling and I were watching.

577
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I think you're in contact.

578
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
So what I want to tell you

579
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,880
This is...

580
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,080
You... I don't know why.

581
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
Maybe it's because

582
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,400
my mouth

583
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,680
You misunderstood that I was

584
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
I think I'm clinging onto you and hanging on her.

585
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,760
It's very shaky.

586
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,960
Yeah. And I think

587
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
And I even think

588
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,840
I might be a little narcissistic.

589
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,600
Do you think you're doing this on purpose?

590
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,720
If you say something like that in front of me,

591
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,560
I would think

592
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,920
this man is really interesting.

593
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,600
Maybe it's about his three views.

594
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,520
You can see that

595
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,560
Xinxin and I are very good at joking.

596
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

597
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,720
Maybe

598
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,880
Look at Xin's jokes

599
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
every day.

600
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
Actually, we are the same people.

601
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,200
We love to pick up this joke.

602
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,080
They talked directly this time.

603
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,760
I think it's because

604
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,320
the third and the fourth are not here.

605
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,240
Fatty is not that proud.

606
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,080
Although I told you to choose,

607
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I did it myself.

608
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,720
I asked you to go, right?

609
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,680
During this period, it's true that Terri

610
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,600
He was rejected by Susu several times.

611
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,200
I had no choice.

612
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
We are alike.

613
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,920
What do you mean?

614
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,320
The abandoned children warm up together.

615
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
I suddenly found that

616
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,760
have some feelings for each other.

617
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,520
We just happened to get together.

618
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,480
We think it's good for each other.

619
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
We get along well

620
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,520
and get along well.

621
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
But in my mind,

622
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,200
The map also told me many times

623
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,560
to respect my feelings

624
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,800
That's why I wrote that letter.

625
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,760
I thought

626
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,320
you might think I'm a little selfish.

627
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
You want to get in touch with both of them.

628
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
That's what I think.

629
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,040
That's what I did.

630
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,520
So I wrote you that letter.

631
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,080
And

632
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,960
I think you're right in the room.

633
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
So I sent Terry

634
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,440
last night.

635
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Then I said

636
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,320
I said I was hesitating

637
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,920
between you and Fatty.

638
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,080
Because I think

639
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I need someone who takes the initiative

640
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,120
to enter my life.

641
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,720
Beiyang.

642
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
But Terri always told me

643
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,640
he's a passive person.

644
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,800
Although I can take the initiative,

645
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,040
but I want to be in a relationship.

646
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,160
I want to be...

647
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,200
Well...

648
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,480
How do you know

649
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
I take the initiative in love?

650
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,920
At least I feel

651
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
you took the initiative to me.

652
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,960
But I might be the one who takes the initiative to Tae-seo.

653
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,120
I might need to guide him.

654
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
That's true.

655
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
I'll take the initiative to talk like this.

656
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,160
Yes.

657
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,960
I'm also grateful to the romantic house

658
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,240
for telling me this.

659
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
I thought I should say it.

660
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
So I just

661
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,320
texted yesterday.

662
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,080
I talked to Tae-seo directly in this room.

663
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,760
I said I was struggling between you and Fatty.

664
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,000
I wrote to Fatty.

665
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,400
So I guess tomorrow

666
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,560
I might have two dates tomorrow.

667
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,640
You chose me.

668
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Then I choose Fatty.

669
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,080
No, you didn't have two dates.

670
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
Yes, I don't know.

671
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Yes.

672
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,800
I just found out.

673
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,360
Do I have no face?

674
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,440
Again?

675
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,320
Okay.

676
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
You just told me

677
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,160
you wanted to keep in touch with Tae-seo.

678
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,600
Right? That's the truth.

679
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes.

680
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,560
If you do it now,

681
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,200
Next second,

682
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,040
write me this letter.

683
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,920
Do you think I can accept it?

684
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,160
I think you're acting weird.

685
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,120
You don't understand the rules, do you?

686
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,080
You send a message to comfort your friends,

687
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
and apologize on a date.

688
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,080
I think you're really weird.

689
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,880
I didn't say I was going on a date. I'm sorry.

690
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,520
I said I'll get to know you again.

691
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
But your behavior is one?

692
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,080
You told me about a date last second.

693
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,800
and you texted them about your feelings.

694
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
I find it very strange.

695
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,720
You were there.

696
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Because he is passive.

697
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,640
So you coax him in the message.

698
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,400
and send it to him.

699
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,520
And I'm

700
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,440
with passion.

701
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,960
Should the one who takes the initiative

702
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
become

703
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,000
I didn't say I should.

704
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,640
So I said it.

705
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,560
So I think

706
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,280
So you made me feel

707
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,400
I feel very sad.

708
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,440
So what I did yesterday was...

709
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,200
You don't have to choose. I'll say goodbye myself.

710
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll retreat myself.

711
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,080
I don't want you to choose.

712
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
Okay, I know.

713
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,200
I accept your feelings.

714
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,240
Do you know how angry I was that day?

715
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,920
Did you see that?

716
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,760
I saw it.

717
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
That's why I...

718
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,000
That's why I asked Tu to coax you.

719
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,360
But in your place,

720
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm showing my feelings for you.

721
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,280
I thought you were upset at that moment.

722
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,040
You know what?

723
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,360
after you asked Tu to coax me,

724
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm worse.

725
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,400
Okay, I didn't know you were such a person.

726
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,040
I know now.

727
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,840
It's weird.

728
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,760
You knew

729
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,720
I would be angry.

730
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,800
And I personally think

731
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,520
when you can comfort someone,

732
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,800
And you sit next to him.

733
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
Ask him out for a drink in the house.

734
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,320
or have a chat.

735
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,640
I think it's comforting.

736
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,720
You made me a "licker".

737
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,440
I feel very embarrassed.

738
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,000
Really.

739
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,680
I always feel that the two of us

740
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,640
I think you've been

741
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,680
the lead.

742
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,120
It makes me passive.

743
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,120
And it makes me look a little anxious.

744
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,920
So why did you...

745
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't know if the map told you

746
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,760
why he cried.

747
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
I think...

748
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Because he was passive yesterday

749
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,880
in your perspective yesterday.

750
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,560
He thinks what you said is reasonable.

751
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
What I said is unreasonable.

752
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,680
Yes.

753
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,480
It makes me look unstable.

754
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
But I'm actually very calm.

755
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,560
I just think...

756
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
I just think that you always

757
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
in the wrong way.

758
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,080
I'd better have the ability.

759
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Actually, you have the ability.

760
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,480
Including that day in the house,

761
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't have the ability.

762
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,920
Then why did Tu and I

763
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,840
with Tu Tu yesterday?

764
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,360
Because I felt

765
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,680
Feel what?

766
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,000
If you feel that I'm guiding you,

767
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,320
if I had the ability to guide you,

768
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,600
you wouldn't have sent that text that day.

769
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,560
to comfort Tae-seo.

770
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,040
I have the ability.

771
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,600
I've guided you to send it to me.

772
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't you have your own ideas?

773
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,240
I have my own thoughts.

774
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,760
Yes.

775
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,480
But I think

776
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,000
you grilled me on fire.

777
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,200
You think it's my behavior

778
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
pushed you

779
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,680
at the edge of the storm.

780
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,240
Yes, that's what it means.

781
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,240
So yesterday I was

782
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
a little out of control yesterday.

783
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
Not a little. You just lost control.

784
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,720
I didn't want to talk.

785
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,320
Later I thought

786
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,280
you pushed me to an explosion point.

787
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,480
Do you know

788
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,600
Do you know after the dinner?

789
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,960
I thought if you had a better temper,

790
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
this wouldn't have happened.

791
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,520
I tried my best to change.

792
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,760
But

793
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,520
I changed a lot.

794
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
I hope so.

795
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,320
I didn't feel it.

796
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
You don't know who I was.

797
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
How do you know I haven't changed?

798
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,320
I just feel that our conversation

799
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,480
we might have

800
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
better than yesterday,

801
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
I didn't want to talk about it yesterday.

802
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
Come in.

803
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
I've made myself clear.

804
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
I'm telling you clearly now.

805
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,760
From tomorrow onwards,

806
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,400
and Tae-seo

807
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,920
with Tae-seo.

808
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,520
You don't agree, right?

809
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,920
I can't agree to contact at the same time.

810
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,640
I can only promise you to contact one first.

811
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,240
Okay.

812
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,160
You can choose to contact Tae-seo first.

813
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,800
Okay.

814
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,240
We'll talk later.

815
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay.

816
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
Okay, you mean

817
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm telling you now.

818
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
I'm telling you clearly.

819
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,400
I'm between you and Tae-seo.

820
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
between you and Tae-seo.

821
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,560
And you think I should stop

822
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,480
I should

823
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,040
I should contact Tae-seo for two days.

824
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't want to grill you anymore.

825
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,480
Thank you.

826
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,160
Is that what you really think?

827
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,360
Yes.

828
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,560
You're so cool.

829
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,320
Because we talked a lot yesterday,

830
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,040
So you're picking two people.

831
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,000
Which one do you like?

832
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
instead of considering so many factors.

833
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,560
So I refuse you.

834
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,160
including ignoring you.

835
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,720
I face my heart.

836
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,280
Because I was in that situation.

837
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
But I don't regret it.

838
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,680
So when I was packing,

839
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,840
the more I collected it,

840
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
I still can't regret it.

841
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,920
I have to make it clear.

842
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,240
Of course I respect his choice.

843
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,760
I think this chat

844
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
made me realize a new chubby guy.

845
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
I think

846
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,400
his charm in me

847
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,440
in my heart.

848
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,680
Let's put aside the impression.

849
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,800
but I think his charm has increased a lot.

850
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
She's very mature.

851
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,720
and mature.

852
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,120
I was really touched at that moment.

853
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,080
But...

854
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,760
I want to calm myself down.

855
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,240
Don't do anything

856
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,640
anything impulsive.

857
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,560
So I think today is

858
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,920
sleepless night.

859
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,960
I think

860
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,320
in my mind.

861
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,800
I really don't understand, family.

862
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,920
Like a thorn in the back

863
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,800
Like sitting on a needle

864
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,880
like a hawk in the throat.

865
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,800
I can't take it anymore.

866
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
Help!

867
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,840
Wake up, Lu.

868
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,040
Let’s sort it out.

869
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,480
Jiang Dunhao had an earthquake just now.

870
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
What happened?

871
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,560
I don't know.

872
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
It's hard to understand adults' world.

873
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,640
So guess why.

874
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,600
No. Hua suddenly said

875
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,440
his charm increased.

876
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,120
I...

877
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm sorry.

878
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,120
Weren't they fighting just now?

879
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,720
Yes.

880
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,760
I'm trying to understand.

881
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,640
I can only

882
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,080
It's a little sudden.

883
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,320
It's too sudden.

884
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,880
Me too. I'm just like you.

885
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,760
She said

886
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,920
Why does he suddenly become more charming?

887
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,360
Hey.

888
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,680
Where?

889
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
Yes.

890
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,320
Where?

891
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,360
I have a feeling.

892
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
they are the two

893
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,040
in life.

894
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,760
can fight each other.

895
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,480
But Tae-seo obeys her.

896
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,320
Yes.

897
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,680
She thinks it's not exciting enough.

898
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,200
Yes.

899
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,880
As long as there is no third or fourth side,

900
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,680
they can

901
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,200
each other.

902
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,280
She thinks it's interesting.

903
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,840
Yes.

904
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,280
But being with Tae-seo

905
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,600
It's relaxing,

906
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,280
but relaxed.

907
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,600
She's afraid it'll become

908
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,080
Yes.

909
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,600
and bored.

910
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,840
But they can do it.

911
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,040
I can control you.

912
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,200
They're controlling each other. They're fighting with wits.

913
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,520
I have another idea.

914
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,240
At first, Hua said she wanted to be biased.

915
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,320
she had to make a firm choice.

916
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
She wants to take the initiative this time.

917
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,000
Is there a possibility

918
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
she liked Fatty in the beginning?

919
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,040
And as far as I know Hua,

920
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,160
I used to take the initiative.

921
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,280
But this time, I want to be passive.

922
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,960
But she is a girl who takes the initiative.

923
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,240
So,

924
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,600
she won't really like a passive person.

925
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Yes.

926
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,840
Her personality is like

927
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,240
in "Love in Rain".

928
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,840
Am I looking for my thorns?

929
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Help!

930
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
I haven't heard that for years.

931
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,880
Yes.

932
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,520
I'm looking for my thorns.

933
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
She's aggressive.

934
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,080
She has to defend.

935
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,480
And she's also defensive to the surrounding environment.

936
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm going to find my thorns.

937
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,800
Tae-seo.

938
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
I thought about it too.

939
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,000
or a girl.

940
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,880
Just like Harry.

941
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,920
But after thinking about it,

942
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,200
if I write about a girl,

943
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,520
I might not come to Huahua.

944
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,760
I think the more people write,

945
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,040
the error rate will be higher.

946
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,920
I bought some drinks today.

947
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,240
I also prepared

948
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,920
My cat's signboard.

949
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
Kitty.

950
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,280
I'd like to invite you

951
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,080
to eat and drink together.

952
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
and have fun chatting.

953
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
To the members of the house.

954
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
Romantic House is opened today.

955
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,120
Today's owner is Terri.

956
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,920
The open time is 8 to 9.

957
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,000
Two men and two women are limited.

958
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
Tarri is opening a romantic house today.

959
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,320
I think

960
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,800
a proactive signal.

961
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,160
Because I used to think

962
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,200
a little passive.

963
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,600
But I think this is the initiative.

964
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,800
To the romantic house?

965
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,440
Sure.

966
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,040
Okay.

967
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
What are you doing?

968
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,320
Have some fries.

969
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,160
Let's go together.

970
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,320
I want to go too.

971
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,840
Good evening.

972
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,440
Welcome.

973
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,520
Three VIPs.

974
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,400
Three.

975
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,760
Welcome to the cat.

976
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
Didn't you see it?

977
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
This is called "Drawing".

978
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,760
You even made a sign.

979
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
So sweet.

980
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Can I drink this?

981
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,720
You can drink it all.

982
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,640
I just made it.

983
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:15,920
Really?

984
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,040
Before you come.

985
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,360
Good.

986
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,280
Come on.

987
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,160
The landlord starts the topic.

988
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,520
What was your first impression of me?

989
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,600
Huahua, Huahua first.

990
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,960
So high.

991
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,880
Yes.

992
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,560
I think you're taller than soup.

993
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,400
Almost.

994
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,040
Full marks.

995
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,840
How many points?

996
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
How much?

997
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,800
How much did you give me?

998
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,080
I asked you first.

999
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,360
7 to 8.

1000
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,760
Seven to eight.

1001
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,520
Is that so?

1002
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,920
How many points?

1003
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,880
Not yet.

1004
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,840
He's handsome,

1005
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
but he's very honest.

1006
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,920
He's too honest.

1007
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,360
Okay.

1008
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,160
We have to keep getting to know him.

1009
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,320
Okay.

1010
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,120
What?

1011
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Go.

1012
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,320
Really? I don't want to know.

1013
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,760
I don't want to know.

1014
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
I flinch immediately

1015
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,159
Of course I'm unhappy after hearing it.

1016
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,840
I think even if

1017
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,199
if you say more than eight,

1018
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,480
I think

1019
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,120
I've been with him for so long.

1020
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,159
In his heart,

1021
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,040
in his heart,

1022
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,280
I think it's lower than I expected.

1023
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
I may have a long observation period

1024
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,440
for a long time.

1025
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,000
That's true

1026
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,120
in my heart.

1027
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,760
I gave her seven to eight points.

1028
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,520
Before,

1029
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,719
For example, before our first date,

1030
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,600
I might only get three points

1031
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,120
or four or five.

1032
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Yes.

1033
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,920
The points are increasing.

1034
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,120
She didn't say it's going down.

1035
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,000
She might not be satisfied with the score.

1036
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,000
Then tell me.

1037
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,400
about 8.5 or 9.

1038
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
I feel so bad right now.

1039
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,040
Seven points.

1040
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
He got 6 to 7, right?

1041
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,760
Seven to eight.

1042
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,720
Not good.

1043
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
Everyone's rating system is different.

1044
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,480
Yes.

1045
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,080
It's almost time.

1046
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
Not much.

1047
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
So do you think

1048
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,040
is necessary?

1049
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,800
Yes.

1050
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,240
We'll never see each other again.

1051
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
Although it's a long-distance place,

1052
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
I might go, right?

1053
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,240
You may also come to Shanghai.

1054
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,000
Me too.

1055
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,160
Come to Beijing later.

1056
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Didn't you say you want to go to Beijing?

1057
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
At least at this stage,

1058
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,360
we are getting along with each other.

1059
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
So you can

1060
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,520
about age.

1061
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,080
I can go up about one round.

1062
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,760
Anything is fine.

1063
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,240
But I can't be one year older.

1064
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,120
Really.

1065
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,160
or a month.

1066
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,000
He is indeed one month younger than you.

1067
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,840
What about you?

1068
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
I'll know his age first

1069
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,920
before I contact him.

1070
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,320
Aren't you...

1071
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,720
Yes.

1072
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,800
I don't know now

1073
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,280
What if you find that you like him

1074
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,080
But he's younger than you.

1075
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm praying not to.

1076
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,480
Okay.

1077
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,000
Where's Xiao Ling?

1078
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,120
The boys I met before are older than me.

1079
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,760
Can you accept younger ones?

1080
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,080
I think this will be

1081
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,960
I need to think about.

1082
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,800
I can't be more than five years old.

1083
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,920
No more than five years old.

1084
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Yes.

1085
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,720
I liked you when I was young.

1086
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
you would change.

1087
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,920
You can't be too big.

1088
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,360
Maybe within five years old.

1089
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,480
You broke up before.

1090
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
Do you know what it is?

1091
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
I dare not ask.

1092
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,000
The last one is the real reason.

1093
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,520
Because when you get old,

1094
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,840
I may think about getting married.

1095
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,320
Maybe

1096
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
her family didn't like me very much.

1097
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,880
Before that,

1098
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,040
when I was young,

1099
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,400
I was impressed.

1100
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,160
We might quarrel a lot.

1101
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,200
And then?

1102
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680
But after the fight,

1103
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,840
this problem hasn't been solved.

1104
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,440
We broke up because we couldn't continue.

1105
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,640
So every time

1106
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,840
for a long time.

1107
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,520
In fact, my previous relationships

1108
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,680
with my heart every time.

1109
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,040
But there's no good result.

1110
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,680
So I may be more pessimistic

1111
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,120
in love.

1112
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Actually, I always think

1113
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,560
Bobo and I

1114
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,120
were left behind.

1115
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,040
left again.

1116
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,480
Yes.

1117
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,680
So you don't contact Fatty anymore?

1118
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,040
No.

1119
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,280
I first met Fatty.

1120
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,680
Then he met Xiaoling.

1121
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,960
Did you contact Fatty first?

1122
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,080
Of course.

1123
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
On the third day,

1124
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,520
Fatty will go on a date.

1125
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Have contact?

1126
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,200
Yes.

1127
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Then on the fifth day, Tae-seo came in.

1128
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
And then?

1129
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,640
I was abandoned.

1130
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,440
Am I?

1131
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,760
So you contact me now

1132
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,200
because Xiaoling has a drawing in the house?

1133
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,160
The soup has Susu.

1134
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,480
Xinxin might...

1135
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,120
What's wrong?

1136
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,920
If I really like him, why can't I grab it?

1137
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,960
would you take it?

1138
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Why not?

1139
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,520
Really?

1140
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
The feeling you gave me.

1141
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,080
I always

1142
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I feel like

1143
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
Like what?

1144
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,280
To warm us up.

1145
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
I'm in a group again.

1146
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,640
Yes.

1147
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,760
And then

1148
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,080
to cherish each other.

1149
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Besides,

1150
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,720
because you gave me a mark, right?

1151
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,400
You said you don't like me that much.

1152
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,520
But I did send you

1153
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,400
to you, right?

1154
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,040
Yes, they gave me their dates.

1155
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
So,

1156
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
you want to

1157
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
to have a partner

1158
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
to have a partner?

1159
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,040
Dok-mi.

1160
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:20,960
Yes.

1161
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,760
That's what I mean.

1162
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,160
I don't have Dok-mi.

1163
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,760
What's there to explain?

1164
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,600
She needs to express directly.

1165
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
This sharp question.

1166
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,800
I think his answer is quite clever.

1167
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,440
He said,

1168
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,560
if I really like someone,

1169
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
I can't take it?

1170
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,600
I feel that

1171
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,080
he treats everyone well.

1172
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,560
He just

1173
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,440
a little more interested in me.

1174
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,600
It's not like

1175
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,400
only interested in me.

1176
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,680
So I didn't answer him.

1177
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm very satisfied.

1178
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Why are flowers not satisfied with

1179
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,480
with Tae-seo's answers?

1180
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,200
I don't understand.

1181
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,480
I think Hua

1182
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
I think Hua still likes fat.

1183
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Is it possible that some people like to be sadistic?

1184
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920
She likes

1185
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Give it to me and I'll give it to you.

1186
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,400
But holding hands makes me so happy.

1187
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,280
She doesn't like things going smoothly.

1188
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,000
It's boring.

1189
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
I don't want myself

1190
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
feel awkward.

1191
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
in a difficult situation.

1192
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,880
But Hua always thinks

1193
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
I was looking at my heart.

1194
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,320
Because everyone's time is limited.

1195
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,520
patience is limited.

1196
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,360
With her personality,

1197
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
if she really falls in love,

1198
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,520
would she want to confirm it every day?

1199
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
She will never feel safe.

1200
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,840
A black hole in emotions.

1201
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
If it works,

1202
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,640
you must find something to confirm your presence.

1203
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
and your love for me.

1204
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,920
is actually quite scary.

1205
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
Yeah.

1206
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
We'll go back first.

1207
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,240
Go.

1208
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,600
How do you feel these days?

1209
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,840
I'm a little confused.

1210
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,800
Friendship or love

1211
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,720
Friendship?

1212
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,120
A few days ago,

1213
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,920
you had some problems with Fatty.

1214
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
He's my roommate.

1215
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,560
I don't know

1216
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,720
how to measure their relationship.

1217
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,360
Don't think too much.

1218
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
Let's look at it from another angle.

1219
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,280
Let me think.

1220
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Just like this Guoli.

1221
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,640
and you can get new ideas.

1222
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,040
Try it.

1223
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,800
Brave heart.

1224
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,760
This is for you.

1225
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,840
to make you braver.

1226
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,160
How is it?

1227
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,600
Drink this.

1228
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Indeed.

1229
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,960
We have to face the problem bravely.

1230
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,440
Yes.

1231
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
There's no problem.

1232
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,400
It can't be solved by a fruit stand.

1233
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
Cheers.

1234
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Brave man.

1235
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,520
Let's enjoy the world.

1236
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,760
Cheers.

1237
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,400
To the soup.

1238
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,040
The House of Satisfaction has been booked.

1239
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,120
Please go there on time.

1240
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,560
Take the initiative.

1241
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,000
I know it must be soup.

1242
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
I'd feel like

1243
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,800
I wonder what happened between us.

1244
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
What does he want to say to me?

1245
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,280
Happy.

1246
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,120
The soup is ready.

1247
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,880
The House of Satisfaction.

1248
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,440
Good evening.

1249
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,520
Sorry, I'm late.

1250
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,560
I couldn't find my phone.

1251
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,240
It's okay. I heard you looking for it.

1252
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
What did he hug?

1253
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,280
I bought it for you.

1254
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,200
Thank you.

1255
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,360
What's wrong?

1256
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,000
Nothing.

1257
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,880
I want to give this to you.

1258
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,640
This is...

1259
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,200
I think we are too bored.

1260
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,160
If you're angry,

1261
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,320
just slap it twice.

1262
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,280
Put it on my bed.

1263
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,960
I knew it.

1264
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,520
Favorite.

1265
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,240
Great.

1266
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,960
Really?

1267
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,600
Okay.

1268
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,560
Can't I just slap you two first?

1269
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,800
I don't know if it's in the house.

1270
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm afraid there's someone in your room.

1271
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,680
It's too cheesy.

1272
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,840
I'm here to tell you.

1273
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,560
Thank you.

1274
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
I'll hold it.

1275
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,600
I think this is very useful.

1276
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,520
Sometimes when I'm unhappy,

1277
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,040
when I'm unhappy.

1278
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,880
I can

1279
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,520
as a bridge to communicate.

1280
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,800
I think it's quite cute.

1281
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,600
GOD C

1282
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,760
A House of Feelings.

1283
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,240
You always bring us lemon tea.

1284
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,840
How much sugar does she want?

1285
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,680
No.

1286
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,280
He only brought me

1287
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,920
Su Zihao.

1288
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,160
has told me several times.

1289
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,360
Why didn't you bring it to him?

1290
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,400
This sweet love

1291
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,480
He took the initiative to invite me to the house

1292
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,280
and became more careful.

1293
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,760
Because he ordered

1294
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,880
Lemon tea.

1295
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,560
To him,

1296
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,360
for him.

1297
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,960
Great.

1298
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,880
Very good.

1299
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,280
Keep up the good work.

1300
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,720
A House of Feelings.

1301
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,280
Can we only take one?

1302
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,200
You can take two.

1303
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,640
Hold it like this.

1304
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,360
My wrist.

1305
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,880
Like this.

1306
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,640
Do you think you can do it on your own?

1307
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,240
Yes.

1308
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,280
The House of Feelings.

1309
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,720
The blood vessels are clearer here.

1310
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,360
Press the middle.

1311
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,080
Close.

1312
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,720
So sweet.

1313
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,200
So sweet.

1314
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,680
The House of Feelings.

1315
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Go upstairs.

1316
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,120
What's wrong?

1317
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,000
Talk to me.

1318
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,920
Why do you want to come up there?

1319
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,360
to sit with you?

1320
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,080
Have you talked to her?

1321
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,400
Have you decided to be friends?

1322
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,320
No.

1323
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,160
You two have solved the problem.

1324
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,080
you decide to continue to understand.

1325
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,960
No.

1326
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,560
So what?

1327
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,480
Guolifang.

1328
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
You're making me cry again.

1329
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,760
No.

1330
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,800
No.

1331
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm so worried.

1332
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,320
She said I was scared.

1333
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,240
Guolifang.

1334
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:13,720
"Guo Lifang".

1335
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:13,760
Well,
"Guo Lifang".

1336
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,520
Well,

1337
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,640
You know,

1338
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,520
I can't say it.

1339
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,600
Good or bad.

1340
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,560
Stand.

1341
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Well...

1342
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,320
Guolifang.

1343
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,920
What's wrong?

1344
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,800
Well...

1345
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,040
Guolifang.
Well...

1346
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,560
Didn't you cry yesterday?

1347
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,520
It's a fruit.

1348
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,040
But...

1349
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
I didn't.

1350
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
I didn't hug you right away.

1351
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:50,880
Guoli.

1352
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,960
I think I didn't do well.

1353
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,320
You scared me.

1354
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,920
I think...

1355
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,080
Guoli.

1356
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,360
I don't know what to do.

1357
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,400
He's stunned.

1358
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,200
Yes.

1359
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,680
Guoli.

1360
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,920
Well,

1361
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,440
I think

1362
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,320
in my mind.

1363
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,760
No.

1364
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,840
Guoli.
Suit yourself.

1365
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,480
Guoli.

1366
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,560
Guoli.

1367
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,240
No.

1368
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,840
Why are you crying?

1369
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,240
No.

1370
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,400
I feel sorry for you.

1371
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,040
Guoli.
I understand you.

1372
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,680
It's okay.

1373
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,840
You...

1374
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,240
But you cried because of me.

1375
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,600
So what?

1376
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
I don't know.

1377
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,600
Guolifang.
Take your time.

1378
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,520
I know you love me.

1379
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,480
Guolifang.

1380
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
It's good to have a brother.

1381
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,320
Guoli.

1382
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:50,400
Black cube.

1383
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,400
Because I know the soup and Susu

1384
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
might go to the House of Satisfaction.

1385
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,520
He said he wanted to talk.

1386
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,040
Then I guess

1387
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,640
something bad happened.

1388
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,840
Is there any new problem?

1389
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,640
When they were talking,

1390
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,480
your eyes turned red.

1391
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,920
Then my eyes were filled with tears.

1392
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
and said he felt sorry for me.

1393
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
He said

1394
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,160
on someone else.

1395
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,880
Not me.

1396
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,200
he felt sorry for me.

1397
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,840
My first reaction was

1398
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,280
That's it.

1399
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,240
If I look back now,

1400
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,120
I can feel

1401
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,960
he didn't comfort me at the first time.

1402
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,760
His reaction

1403
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,640
he was stunned.

1404
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,080
and cried in front of him.

1405
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,560
To be honest,

1406
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,840
The last time

1407
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,280
for almost ten years.

1408
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,400
Guoli.

1409
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,760
He rarely shows his weakness.

1410
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,560
I didn't expect

1411
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,520
I didn't expect that.

1412
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,040
My first reaction was an accident.

1413
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,960
But then I was very happy.

1414
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,120
I feel

1415
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,240
I didn't take it seriously.

1416
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,080
Guolifang.

1417
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,560
This...

1418
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,280
The way we get along

1419
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,360
is like this.

1420
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,320
No.

1421
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,720
Guolifang.
Take your time.

1422
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,760
You can't do it anymore.

1423
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,280
Guo Lifang.

1424
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:13,600
Guolifang.

1425
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,400
Do you want to see

1426
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,800
how happy your sister is now?

1427
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:16,840
I know you. Go.
how happy your sister is now?

1428
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,440
I know you. Go.

1429
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,520
It's okay.

1430
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,280
Guoli.

1431
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:24,520
I know you. Go.

1432
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,440
Don't cry.

1433
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,800
Men don't cry easily.

1434
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,160
Wipe it.

1435
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,040
Guolifang.
I know you.

1436
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,840
It's okay.

1437
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,760
I...

1438
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,480
I'm sorry.

1439
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,400
Guolifang.

1440
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:42,840
Don't be sorry.

1441
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,360
You think the first reaction

1442
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
to hug me,

1443
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,080
and told me

1444
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,640
"Don't cry."

1445
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,280
to stop crying?

1446
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,240
But...

1447
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,920
Think about it.

1448
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,880
the way we usually get along?

1449
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,160
Guolifang.
Take your time.

1450
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,440
Everyone else does that.

1451
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,600
Is what others do right?

1452
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,080
No.

1453
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,440
I don't know

1454
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,000
why I did that.

1455
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,360
I think it's quite normal.

1456
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
We're not that close.

1457
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,640
It doesn't mean we're not close.

1458
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,720
or something else.

1459
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,160
It's not any sign.

1460
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,720
If you make us so clingy,

1461
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,280
I'm not used to it.

1462
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,240
And I think...

1463
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,840
But I feel guilty.

1464
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,520
Then play with me more every day.

1465
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,280
Guolifang.
I understand you.

1466
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,320
It's okay.
Guolifang.
I understand you.

1467
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,040
It's okay.

1468
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,640
Because the way we get along

1469
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,720
many people may think

1470
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,480
you don't interact much.

1471
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,400
You don't talk much.

1472
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,880
You only send messages three or four times a month.

1473
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,560
But this is how we get along.

1474
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,040
Since college,

1475
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,720
we've been staying at home every holiday,

1476
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,080
but I didn't feel like

1477
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,160
like this.

1478
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,760
We've been together for so many days.

1479
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
we can see each other during the day and night.

1480
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,800
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

1481
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,760
I'm afraid Xiao Ling will fall out.

1482
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,400
When will you comfort me?

1483
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,120
You never cried at my place.

1484
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,080
Cry and let me see.

1485
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,200
I'll comfort you.

1486
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,320
I'll punch you.

1487
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,640
Are you okay?

1488
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm fine.

1489
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,200
It's okay.

1490
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,320
Guoli.

1491
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
If we have a heart-to-heart conversation like today,

1492
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
I don't think

1493
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,760
since college.

1494
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,520
Now you want me to remember

1495
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,640
what it is to cry because of me.

1496
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
I may not remember.

1497
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,120
So he suddenly came here today.

1498
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,920
I will...

1499
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
OK.

1500
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,600
Not bad.

1501
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:03,880
Yeah.

1502
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,320
I'm happy.

1503
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,080
Actually, I'm having a hard time staying in this room.

1504
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Guolifang.

1505
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:15,680
Guolifang.

1506
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,480
In this room,

1507
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,760
in this room.

1508
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,520
So I want

1509
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,000
what I want the most.

1510
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,680
But I think everyone is different from me.

1511
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,320
Guoli.

1512
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,520
So what?

1513
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,920
But I think I'm the only one

1514
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,840
in this room.

1515
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,520
I'll tell you my real thoughts.

1516
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,960
It's fine if you're angry.

1517
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,080
But I think

1518
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,440
a little boy now.

1519
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,920
But I think it's normal.

1520
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,760
Because you're a university student now.

1521
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,520
You're still in school.

1522
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,520
So I think

1523
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,080
I'm a little boy. So what?

1524
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,720
Yeah, but I think I need to improve.

1525
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,240
But I don't know

1526
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,640
I should

1527
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,920
I'm going to break through what I'm suffering.

1528
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,040
I'll just let it be.

1529
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,280
But I'm contradicted every day.

1530
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,960
From your point of view,

1531
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,280
you wouldn't want these problems

1532
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,240
to bother you again and again.

1533
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,840
So you will

1534
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,040
You want to solve it.

1535
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,560
Your subconscious

1536
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,720
will help you solve this problem.

1537
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,080
So my suggestion is

1538
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,160
Okay, you've realized the problem.

1539
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,960
Next,

1540
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,120
in the future,

1541
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,920
you can try to think from different angles.

1542
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
But you can try.

1543
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,000
If you're still sick,

1544
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,040
then return it completely.

1545
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,760
It doesn't matter at all.

1546
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,480
Because it can't be done at once.

1547
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,680
I've always been like this.

1548
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,280
You won't.

1549
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,000
If you're always like this,

1550
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,880
you'll face more problems.

1551
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,400
What should we do?

1552
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,320
If you encounter more problems,

1553
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,760
I'll force you.

1554
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,560
You have to change.

1555
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,600
So you have to change.

1556
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,240
Do you think

1557
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,080
I think even if you don't change yourself,

1558
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,520
you will be forced to change.

1559
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,920
You'll be forced to grow up.

1560
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,600
So I think it's not a bad thing

1561
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,920
is not a bad thing.

1562
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,120
Just like you cried again today.

1563
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,800
So when you encounter problems,

1564
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,760
You will encounter the problems you should encounter.

1565
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,880
You have a storm, so do I.

1566
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,440
Everyone has a storm.

1567
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,400
What is a storm?

1568
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,000
What's the sudden emotional cover?

1569
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,760
That kind of thing

1570
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,120
I'm saving up

1571
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,920
to a certain extent.

1572
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,080
I used to save up.

1573
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,280
But now I think

1574
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,760
that

1575
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,960
If I think

1576
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,400
I can't take this anymore.

1577
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,520
I can't hold it anymore.

1578
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,160
Then I'll tell Tom or Xinxin

1579
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,040
or tell anyone.

1580
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,800
Yes.

1581
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,720
Okay.

1582
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,880
Come to me more often.

1583
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,040
I haven't met 100 percent yet.

1584
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,840
It's something

1585
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,640
that you need to know right away.

1586
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,320
How about this?

1587
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,480
If it exceeds 30 percent,

1588
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,400
I'll come to you.

1589
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,400
Then you come to me

1590
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,160
you come to me.

1591
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,400
It's your protection for your brother.

1592
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,440
Yes.

1593
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,080
I think he has heard it.

1594
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,320
Because he is

1595
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,440
a serious person.

1596
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,400
I'll tell him at the end.

1597
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,120
Come on, let's throw the slippers down.

1598
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,640
I'll throw them first.

1599
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,040
I want to go down first.

1600
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,760
You need to raise your butt.

1601
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,120
Why are you so stiff?

1602
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,560
Because your weight will be bigger.

1603
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,720
so your butt will be hurt.

1604
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,480
You're great.

1605
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,720
It's very healing.

1606
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,200
Normally, if it were him,

1607
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,000
he would never do this with me.

1608
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think this is a good start.

1609
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,200
So it's a good thing.

1610
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,880
It's good to have a good chat.

1611
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,320
Both of them are real.

1612
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,400
The soup and Xiaoling

1613
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,600
are beautiful.

1614
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,200
Yes.

1615
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,040
The soup said he wanted to make progress.

1616
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,800
But what I want to say is

1617
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,400
their progress

1618
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,720
It's happening invisibly.

1619
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,200
between him and Xiaoling,

1620
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,360
or when he was with Susu,

1621
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,960
the soup is changing silently.

1622
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,080
So don't doubt yourself.

1623
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,520
You've seen yourself

1624
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,720
You see each other and change yourself.

1625
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,000
I believe this is the energy

1626
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,200
brought to you.

1627
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,760
A lot of stories have happened in this episode.

1628
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,560
I think there's a key word to coax.

1629
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,720
I want to ask you.

1630
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,720
Did you have any experience

1631
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,600
when you grow up?

1632
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,360
Because I don't like to quarrel and spend the night.

1633
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,680
For example she's in the living room and I'm in the kitchen.

1634
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,360
I might find a chance

1635
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,080
to go there.

1636
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,240
Okay, don't be angry.

1637
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,600
Hug her like this.

1638
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,240
I did it ten times and ten times.

1639
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,840
But I don't think he can coax me.

1640
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,360
Because I don't think I'm a child.

1641
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,560
I'm a person who can communicate.

1642
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,880
If you coax me,

1643
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
I can't accept it.

1644
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,440
Because I think you're stimulating me by coaxing me.

1645
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,560
So I always think

1646
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,800
I have a question.

1647
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,480
I think I've never said that before.

1648
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,400
If I get angry,

1649
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,360
he'll say it.

1650
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,720
It'll be fine if it's impossible.

1651
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,880
I have to

1652
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,040
to make it clear.

1653
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,400
Luckily, she's not my wife.

1654
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,640
Yes.

1655
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,000
Because sometimes

1656
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,720
not everything has to be explained.

1657
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,040
You made it clear when you fought.

1658
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,680
Do you know where her pain is?

1659
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,400
I might not

1660
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,680
do this anymore.

1661
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,680
I don't think it's too hard.

1662
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,720
Dan, you...

1663
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,160
I'm afraid it's a bit cheesy.

1664
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,880
I like it when I say it.

1665
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
We just get goose bumps.

1666
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,040
Because when we have disagreements,

1667
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,920
we're used to hugging and chatting.

1668
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,800
Just hug him for a while.

1669
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,720
Hold you for a while.

1670
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,400
Strength training.

1671
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,800
This is

1672
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,080
I'll act cute.

1673
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,240
Because if both parties

1674
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,920
in a family,

1675
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,200
I get nervous.

1676
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,480
I'm used to hugging him first.

1677
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,080
Yes.

1678
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,840
When you hug each other,

1679
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,200
when they talk.

1680
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,640
Yes.

1681
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,760
I won't let the temperature go up.

1682
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,520
You have to touch it.

1683
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,480
Yes, you must touch it.

1684
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,160
When there's a fight, Dan...

1685
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,720
Speaking of coaxing me,

1686
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,600
in my love life,

1687
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,040
in my love life?

1688
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,800
I don't think so.

1689
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,120
That could only be called

1690
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,440
after each other made a mistake.

1691
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,680
after making mistakes.

1692
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,200
and the so-called process of being cute.

1693
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,600
The soup and Xiaoling were quite envious.

1694
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,200
She just hugged me and...

1695
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,080
It's okay.

1696
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,640
Look, you still need to hug me.

1697
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,480
Yes.

1698
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,160
I envy him.

1699
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,240
It's usually said

1700
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,840
You have to fool it later.

1701
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,600
I was wondering when I would lie to him.

1702
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,000
I thought

1703
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,280
it might have to be before adulthood.

1704
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,080
and parents

1705
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,040
with her parents.

1706
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,360
Mom often holds slippers

1707
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,160
with slippers.

1708
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,080
I won't do it again.

1709
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,240
That's just coaxing mom.

1710
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,480
Actually speaking of coaxing

1711
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,720
coaxing is a way to express love.

1712
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,360
We also hope that

1713
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,480
can have

1714
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,320
who is always willing to coax you.

1715
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,280
In the next episode,

1716
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,200
will start a two-day and a night trip in Tianjin.

1717
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,560
Will this trip

1718
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,960
to the direction everyone wants?

1719
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,080
Will our relationship

1720
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,120
any new breakthroughs and changes?

1721
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,080
Let's look forward to the next episode.

1722
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,040
Let's sing "Love Sisters".

1723
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,320
Let love double.

1724
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,720
I haven't heard this voice for a long time.

1725
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,960
What?

1726
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,760
What's wrong?

1727
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,720
We're going to Tianjin.

1728
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,840
This weekend is a two-day trip.

1729
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,960
The destination is Tianjin.

1730
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,080
Next, choose the room

1731
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,520
the room.

1732
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,360
suite.

1733
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,960
We're the same.

1734
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,240
Maybe

1735
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,920
some new stories.

1736
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,160
We're at the beach.

1737
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,440
Why are you so good-looking?

1738
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,880
I feel very happy.

1739
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,840
I'm happy too.

1740
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,720
Let's take a photo.

1741
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,280
This is good.

1742
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,800
represents my unknown love.

1743
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,160
Unknown love.

1744
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,040
I feel like I'm declaring the sovereignty.

1745
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,400
Sit with my sister.

1746
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,560
I dare to sit here.

1747
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,000
I'm scared.

1748
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,200
Why are you so handsome even when you're scared?

1749
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,560

1750
