I've ordered the mop.

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,680
But I don't know if it works.
Susu.

1401
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,400

Let me write it down.

It's so hard to get this badge.
Joo Dan.

1409
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Yang Gen.
You guessed one question right.

1410
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Yang Gen,
After watching these two pairs,

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
I think it's totally different.

Yang Gen.
Yeah.

1419
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,800
Mu Chun.
Actually, his two groups

1420
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
A totally different family atmosphere.
Mu Chun.

1421
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,040
Mu Chun.
For example,

1422
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,080
Soup and Xiaoling.
Mu Chun.

1423
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,280

They've been in this kind of

He has a strong sense of restriction.
Mu Chun.

1425
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,760
Mu Chun.
growing up in the atmosphere.

1426
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,240
It’s easy to
Mu Chun.

1427
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,520
Mu Bom: what the child really needs.

1428
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,240
Mu Chun.
It’s what we do most of the time.

1429
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,760
is what his parents need.
Mu Chun.

1430
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,960
Mu Chun.
So he will gradually

1431
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
some inner needs.
Mu Chun.

1432
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,680
Mu Chun.
in your heart.

1433
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,400
So it’s also their
Mu Chun.

1434
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Mu Chun.
in such an environment.

1435
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,520
More often ask if you are tired.
Mu Chun.

1436
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,680
Mu Chun.
Are you nervous?

1437
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
We seem to know each other well.
Mu Chun.

1438
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,480
Mu Chun.
But we comfort each other.

1439
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
It’s logical.
Mu Chun.

1440
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,440
Mu Chun.
Who do you like?

1441
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,080
I’ll give you some reference.
Mu Chun.

1442
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,960
Jiang Dunhao.
Calm down.

1443
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,520

Yes.

Harry and Susu.

Their family
Lynchon.

1446
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,240
Mu Chun.
are totally different.

1447
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,600
Mu Chun.
Their growth atmosphere

1448
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,240
From their parents,
Mu Chun.

1449
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,880
Mu Chun.
from their parents.

1450
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,160
We can also see that
Mu Chun.

1451
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,320
Mu Chun.
they are not limited to their development.

1452
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,880
or I don’t give them
Mu Chun.

1453
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,920
Mu Chun.
to them.

1454
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
So the family atmosphere
Mu Chun.

1455
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,840
Mu Chun.
is

1456
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,120
Open and easy.
Mu Chun.

1457
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,160
Mu Chun.
and safe.

1458
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,800
Lord Wu,
But as parents,

1459
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,280
I think we've been exploring
Lord Wu,

1460
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,680
Lord Wu.
this way, right?

1461
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,440
If it's wrong,
Lord Wu.

1462
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,720
Zun Wu.
we'll try another way.

1463
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,200
As a parent,
Zun Wu.

1464
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,600
is the most challenging job.
Wu Zun.

1465
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,160
Joo Dan.

1466
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,200
Because every child is unique.
Joo Dan.

1467

There is no standard answer.
Zun Wu.

1468
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,760
Joo Dan.
You have to find someone that suits you.

1469
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
I'm with my child.
Joo Dan.

1470
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
Zun Wu.
So sometimes, you have to be strict.

1471
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,320
I think I need to guide them.
Zun Wu.

1472
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,600
Lord Wu
My daughter is 14 now.

1473
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,240
has changed a lot.
Lord Wu

1474
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,800
Lord Wu.
Because when you were 14, you started to understand.

1475
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,440
She has her own ideas.
Lord Wu.

1476
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,600
She is no longer
Lord Wu.

1477
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,840
Lord Wu used to be one to twelve years old.

1478
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,680
Zun Wu
She listens to you in everything.

1479
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,240
Lu.
Be good. OIVI.

1480
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,720
Zun Wu.
Yes.

1481
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,560
We need to make some adjustments.
Zun Wu.

1482
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,280
Lord Wu.
We can't be like before.

1483
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,560
So I think it's a kind of respect.
Lord Wu.

1484
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,440
You should respect her, too.
Lord Wu.

1485
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,240
instead of listening to me.
Lord Wu.

1486
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,920
Lu.
You are the kind of person

1487
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll try my best to be friends.

Joo Dan.
I don't think there's anyone in my house.

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,240
I don't set a target or anything.
Joo Dan.

1491
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,640

My family has always been like this with Mr. Zhou.

My husband has agreed that
Joo Dan.

1493
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,760
Joo Dan is a child who takes his own path.

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,920
Joo Dan.
So we respect our kids.

1495
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,440
Make your own choice.
Joo Dan.

1496
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,320
Joo Dan.
Mr. Zhou and I are more used to

1497
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,240
As a bystander,
Joo Dan.

1498
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
Joo Dan.
Help them when they fall.

1499
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
You have to walk like this.

Joo Dan.
It's all my child's choice.

Joo Dan.
It'll be easier this way.

1506
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600

My mom's just a freeloader.

You can’t talk on the table.
Jiang Dunhao.

1527
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,360

Love me.
Jiang Dunhao.

At that time, my dad

at that time.

1532
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,200
But my mom still couldn’t convince me.
Jiang Dunhao.

1533
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
Jiang Dunhao.
I said OK.

1534
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,120
Let you learn music.
Jiang Dunhao.

1535
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,680

Harry.
Not bad.

1575
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,920
I didn't hit my head.
Harry.

1576

If Harry hears Sue Su fell,
Joo Dan.

1590
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,000
Joo Dan.
Harry's reaction...

Yang Gen.
Yes.

He said he fell in the bathroom.
Deer.

1596
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,960

So if he's your younger brother...

Didn't you fall down?
Harry.

Susu.

1810
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,280
Susu.
Two are enough.

Thank you.

I don't think there's much oil.
Flower.

Then I said I wanted to eat salmon.

He said, "Take it."

I looked at the price.
Flower.

1839
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,080

I thought it might be a bit expensive.

He still said to take it directly.
Flower.

Flower.
There's a small one.

1842

It just looks a bit flower.

So you think it's longer?
Fatty.

1844

Jiang Dunhao.
Is Hua your sister?

1851
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,920
Joo Dan.
I think they are siblings.

1852
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,440
I don't think they're brothers.

We need to buy vegetables for a long time.

I can make dumplings.
Harry.

1898
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,640
Xinxin.
It's too hard to make dumplings.

1899
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,920
Harry.
You can't try, right?

You're the boss.

Let's take a bigger one.

1912

Okay, it's quite fair.
Harry.

This is big.
Harry.

Beans.
Harry.

1916
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,760
Harry.
Forget it. I can't buy beans.

1917
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,920
The beans are not cooked.
Harry.

What a small egg.

1919

This one.
Xinxin.

00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,440
Harry.
I think so too.

1924
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,480
I really have OCD.
Harry.

1925
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,600
Harry.
You don't know what true OCD is.

1926
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,840
Xinxin.
I know you have OCD.

1927
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,560
I feel it.
Xinxin.

1928
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,320
How about cutting it with this?
Xin.

Here.
Harry.

1930

Lu.
Yes.

1942
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,200

Give it to me.
Harry.

Do you have bags?

00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Xinxin.
Yes, I went to get it.

1947
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,000
Harry.
Don't hold the bag.

1948
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,640

They completely ignored him.

You can make scallops with garlic.
Harry.

It feels like

Push it for a while.

I'm tired.
Soup.

Harry.

1958
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,240

Okay.

Harry.
I can learn.

1965
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,520
Xinxin.
It should be simple.

1966
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,720
Harry.
It's not hard.

1967
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,240
Jiang Dunhao.
So manly.

1968
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,640
Great.
Song Yanran.

1969
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,080
Xinxin.
Don't chew gum.

1970
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,800
Harry.
Can't I?

1971
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,520
Xinxin.
No.

1972
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,200
Xinxin.
Oh no.

There's no

Xin.
One by one.

00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,640
Yes.
Harry.

1978
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
Soup.
I'll ask him.

1979
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,000
Where's the film?
Soup.

1980
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
I want this.
Fatty.

1981
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,040
This looks better.
Susu.

1982
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,440
Hua.
One pack is enough.

1983
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,360
Flower.
Yes, because just now...

1984
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,080
Susu.
It's overloaded.

1985
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,120
Map.
Why is he alone?

1986
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,760
Soup.
Map.

1987
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,440
Hua.
Why are you alone?

1988
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,000
Susu.
No.

1989
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,640
Soup.
They are over there.

1990
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,960
I'm here to get the bread.
Soup.

1991
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,760
Soup.
Did you buy it?

1992
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,960
Hua.
Take it if you want.

1993
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,440
Take a look at the expiration date.
Hua.

1994
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,640
Soup.
You haven't bought it yet, right?

1995
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,120
Hua.
Yes.

1996
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,040
Soup.
Please.

1997
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,920
Okay.
Soup.

1998
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,480
Susu.
We...

1999
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,640
Chili sauce
Susu.

2000
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,160
Susu.
I bought ketchup.

2001
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,800
I bought ketchup.
Xin.

2002
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,360
Susu.
Yes.

2003
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,520
Do you have
Susu.

2004
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,480
Black pepper.
Susu.

2005
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,640
Yang Gen.
Who are you looking at?

2006
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,600
That look.
Yan.

2007
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,040
Xinxin.
Let's go get it now.

2008
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,600
Black pepper.
Xinxin.

2009
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,240
And the pot.
Map.

2010
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,680
Susu.
Go over there.

2011
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,560
I'll go out and get something.
Susu.

2012
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,760
Susu.
Do you have a strong bag?

2013
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,680
Staff.
That's it.

2014
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,760
Okay.
Susu.

2015
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,120
Hua.
We should have brought environmental bags.

2016
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,320
Do you want hazelnut cocoa sauce?
Harry.

2017
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,800
Xin.
We can buy seasoning.

2018
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,800
Harry.
Sauce.

2019
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,200
What about this?
Harry.

2020
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,240
Strawberry jam.
Harry.

2021
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,040
Jam.
Harry.

2022
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,920
Xin.
I saw it.

2023
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,720
Fatty.
Soup.

2024
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,840
Let's go.
Fatty.

2025
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,760
Let's go.
Soup.

2026
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,720
Song Yeon-ju.
His hands are like this.

2027
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,640
Jiang Dunhao.
So close.

2028
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,080
Lord Wu.
His heart is with Susu. Look.

2029
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,960
Joo Dan.
Yes.

2030
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,320
Susu.
Do you want to see if there's anything to drink?

2031
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Let's go now.
Let's go.

2032
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,960
Susu.
Now?

2033
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,360
Soup.
I think she...

2034
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,120
Maybe I'm interested in the map.
Soup.

2035
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Soup.
That's why I'm still confused.

2036
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,160
I don't know what's going on either.
Soup.

2037
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,880
I flinched.
Song Yeon-ju.

2038
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,200
Lu,
No.

2039
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,280
Susu is not interested in the map at all.
Lu,

2040
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,840
It's a misunderstanding.
Joo Dan.

2041
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,200
Lu,
He'd rather not take action.

2042
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,960
doesn't want to make mistakes.
Lu,

2043
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,760
Lu,
He pretended not to care.

2044
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,400
Yang Gen.
If I were you, I would spread to the sky.

2045
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,000
Yang Gen.
(Yang Gen)

2046
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,160
Joo Dan.
I think he needs time.

2047
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,880
It'll be better if we get close.
Joo Dan.

2048
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,280
Xinxin.
Let's split up.

2049
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,040
Boys take these things to the car.
Xinxin.

2050
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,880
Xinxin.
We'll go buy milk tea.

2051
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,800
Go.
Hua.

2052
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,760
Fatty.
Push two each.

2053
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,800
Fatty.
Push that one.

2054
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,520
I'll push this.
Fatty.

2055
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,640
Let's go.
Fatty.

2056
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,080
Fatty.
The soup is hard to control.

2057
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,360
Soup.
Put it together.

2058
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,840
Fatty.
It's really hard to control the car.
Winter time.

2059
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,200
We need to cooperate.
Fatty.

2060
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,280
Fatty.
Push the cart down first.

2061
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,200
Fatty.
Then pick up the car over there.

2062
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,160
Harry.
That's good.

2063
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,200
It can get stuck.
Harry.

2064
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,080
Harry.
I don't think I need to go out for two months.

2065
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,440
To be honest,
Harry.
I don't think I need to go out for two months.

2066
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,040
Fatty.
Yes.

2067
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,800
We bought 20 people's quantity.
Fatty.

2068
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,000
Anything else?
Soup.

2069
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Put it in the back seat.
Harry.

2070
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,560
Let's go.
Fatty.

2071
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,880
I'm in Tientsin.
Harry.

2072
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,440
Harry.
How to sit?

2073
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,720
I'll take the passenger seat.
Harry.

2074
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,160
Yang Gen.
I'll take the passenger seat.

2075
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,440
Lu.
He did it on purpose.

2076
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,440
He's helping my sister.
Lu.

2077
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,400
Joo Dan.
Yes.

2078
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,080
Fatty.
Let's go.

2079
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,240
Let's go.
Fatty.

2080
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
Soup.
You won't let us play the song, right?

2081
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,400
Give him the earphones.
Song Yeon-ju.

2082
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,200
Susu.
I can give you one.

2083
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,960
Soup.
Okay, thank you.

2084
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,760
Susu.
Do you want to listen?

2085
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,480
Soup.
Okay.

2086
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,520
Thank you.
Soup.

2087
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Song Yeon-ju.
It's divided.

2088
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,520
Susu.
What do you want to hear, R&B?

2089
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,320
Susu.
You like R&B?

2090
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,200
Soup
I like it too.

2091
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,040
Susu.
I like it, just so-so.

2092
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,280
Soup.
I like R&B.

2093
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,360
Susu.
Why are you so loud and quiet?

2094
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,760
Soup.
Your news should be...

2095
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,800
Susu.
No news.

2096
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,840
Susu.
It's really big and small.

2097
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,440
Susu.
Let's switch.

2098
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,600
Susu.
Maybe there's something wrong.

2099
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,480
My hand touched it.
Lu.

2100
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,960
Susu.
Can you hear me?

2101
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,520
Soup.
I got it.

2102
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,320
Susu.
Do you want to order a song?

2103
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,080
Soup.
I'm not ordering.

2104
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Soup.
I'll listen to you.

2105
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,160
Susu.
Okay.

2106
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,520
Susu.
My playlist is the best in the world.

2107
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,800
Susu.
But I like Jay Chou the most.

2108
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,880
My favorite.
Susu.

2109
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,680
Soup.
I don't know why.

2110
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,720
Jay Chou seems to write good songs.
Soup.

2111
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,160
Susu.
Yes.

2112
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,560
There are always songs that are not popular.
Susu.

2113
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,720
Susu.
But I think every song

2114
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,560
Now it's your turn to be the light bulbs.
Joo Dan.

2115
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,160
Yang Gen.
Yes.

2116
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,920
Jiang Dunhao.
I feel my heart fluttering.

2117
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,880
That look.
Song Yanju.

2118
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,160
Rath.
Song Yeon-ju.

2119
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,680
Let's put these food first.
Map.

2120
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,480
You have to put that in.
Map.

2121
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,880
Map.
Let's go home.

2122
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,400
Map.
Bring these shabby things in first.

2123
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,000
Susu.
Long time no see.

2124
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,200
I think we've met somewhere.
Map.

2125
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,080
Fatty.
I can eat my noodles now.

2126
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,840
Soup.
Eat.

2127
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,000
I'll eat noodles then.
Fatty.

2128
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,360
(Dinner)
Let's eat.

2129
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
It's fun.
Map.

2130
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,200
We're really like playing house.
Map.

2131
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:46,960
Fatty.
We...

2132
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,800
What do you mean by playing house?
Fatty.

2133
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,280
Fatty.
We're a family now.

2134
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,280
Hua.
Let me help you.

2135
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,400
Susu.
I can't stand it anymore.

2136
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,000
I feel I'm alive.
Map.

2137
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,440
Susu.
Yes, I'm alive again.

2138
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,400
Fatty.
Did you buy the humidifier?

2139
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,680
No.
Xin.

2140
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,080
Susu.
I'm going to buy a vacuum cleaner.

2141
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,200
Xin.
I was going to buy a vacuum.

2142
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,520
Fatty.
Do you want a vacuum cleaner?

2143
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,200
Susu.
Yes.

2144
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,000
Xinxin.
Sometimes when I wake up,

2145
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,120
I always think
Xinxin.

2146
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,960

Susu.
Yes.

2148
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,480

Missing is the pain of breathing

Map.
Who do you miss?

2150
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,960
Xinxin.
All the people I want are here.

2151
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,840
Hwa.
What a sweet talker.

2152
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,040
Xinxin is so good at showing signals.
Joo Dan.

2153
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,440
Fatty.
Who do you miss?

2154
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,520
I miss you all.
Tu.

2155
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,240
Hua.
So lovely.

2156
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,040
In fact, girls don't like romance that much.
Hua.

2157
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,720
Flowers should be favored.
Yang Gen.

2158
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,920
Xinxin.
Girls like favorites.

2159
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,400

Why are your ears red?

Fang...

2166
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,960
Susu.
I'm in a hurry.

2167
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,240

I'm blushing.

2169
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,760

Susu.
Lin Yi.

2173
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,360
Xin.
No, the type.

2174
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,400
Susu.
Lin Yi's type is young.

2175
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,520
Fatty.
Feeling young.

2176
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,000
Susu.
Because I like gentle girls.

2177
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,280
I like gentle girls.
Susu.

2178
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,680
Joo Dan.
Susu, you can't do this.

2179
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,680
The soup will misunderstand.
Joo Dan.

2180
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,080
Harry.
What do you like?

2181
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:19,720
Soup.
What?

2182
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,120
Fatty.
What kind of girl do you like?

2183
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,120
Harry.
Isn't that Ni Ni?

2184
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,880

I don't know.

01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,920
I used to like you.

Now
Soup

2187

I like younger girls now.

2188
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,520
Fatty.
You've grown up.

2189
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,880
Soup
Well, sometimes I...

2190
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,600
I don't get along with my sister's (style).
Soup

2191
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,280
Xinxin.
So now you like your sister.

2192
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,160
Soup.
I don't know.

2193
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,320
Jiang Dunhao.
He took a look at Susu.

2194
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,040
Anything is fine.
Susu.

2195
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,960
Soup.
I think I need to know more about it.

2196
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,080
Yang Gen.
He's very cautious.

2197
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,480
I dare not say anything wrong.
Yang Gen.

2198
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,880
Susu.
What type does Harry like?

2199
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,080
I like it.
Harry.

2200
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,720
Harry.
It's not that high.

2201
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,840
Not very high.
Harry.

2202
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,320
Susu.
I don't like it very much.

2203
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,160
How tall do you think is?
Susu.

2204
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,040
Harry.
Over 17cm.

2205
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,520
Fatty.
We're 1.7 meters tall.

2206
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,200
Hua.
Of course, Xiao Ling.

2207

Map.
I won't bump into you.

2208
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,760
Fatty.
I also like those who are not tall.

2209
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,400
Susu.
How tall is that?

2210
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,240
Fatty.
It's below 1.8 meters.

2211
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,760
Lord Wu.
He likes tall ones.

2212
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,400
Xinxin.
They can be roommates.

2213
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,080
Flower.
I like those who don't have the central air conditioner.

2214
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,400
Who's the "central air conditioner"?
Soup.

2215
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Hua.
See for yourself.

2216
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,600
I don't like someone who's good to everyone.
Hua.

2217
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,680
Fatty.
Look at you.

2218
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,920
Xinxin.
She likes

She's washing the dishes.

2220
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,400
Don't come over.
Xinxin.

2221
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,560
Fatty.
Don't come over.

2222
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,360
Xin.
Get in.

2223
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,720
It's so cold. Sit down.
Xin.

2224
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,600
Xinxin.
Just like that.

2225
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,400
You like that kind, right?
Xinxin.

2226
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,400
Susu.
There's a doorbell.

2227
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,360
A letter.

2228
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,000
Read the letter.
Song Yeon-ju.

2229
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,160
Fatty.
I can only think of three words.

2230
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,120
Stop eating.
Fatty.

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,720
Smile.
Xiao Ling.

01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,400
Xiao Ling.
Nice to meet you.

Today, let me introduce

The best siblings in the world.
Xiao Ling.

Harry.
Although I don't know how to praise you,

2236
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,480
But I'm still very proud.

We meet every day these days.

Talk to me more.

No matter where we are,

01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,640
Our bond has never broken.
Xin.

2242
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,280

I will do my best.

I can’t stand it just by the teaser.

Joo Dan.
Oh no.

2252

Yang Gen.
What's wrong, Lu?

Lu.
Tears are low.

Yes, very easy to empathize.

01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,000
Yang Gen.
Both of my brothers have seen it.

2314
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,400
Both.
Yan Zhou.

2315
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,200
Yang Gen.
Do you feel awkward when they are in a relationship?

2316
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:29,720
Song Yeon-ju.
I'm not embarrassed.

2317
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,200
But they felt awkward when they saw me talking.
Song Yeon-ju.

2318
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,680
Yang Gen.
Why?

2319
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,520
I don't know.
Yan Zhou.

2320
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,360
Song Yeon-ju.
I feel very natural.

2321
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,720
They're just... Sister, stop it.
Song Yeon-ju.

2322
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,120
Then I...
Song Yanju.

2323
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,480
"Song Yanju".
Right? Yes.

2324
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,320
Then I said what I did.
"Song Yanju".

2325
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,360
Song Yeonju, they would say you're nice to him.

2326
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,120
Yang Gen.
I didn't expect his advice to you

2327
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:43,880
Stop it.
Yang Gen.

2328
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,840
Song Yeon-ju.
But my brother is really good to his girlfriend.

2329
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,880
My mom taught my brother
Song Yeon-ju.

2330
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,280
"Song Yeon-ju."

2331
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,920
Song Yeon-ju.
I've been educating

2332
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,120
Be good to girls.
Song Yeon-ju.

2333
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,440
My brother started paying when he was five.
Lu.

2334
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,600
Joo Dan.
Because of his siblings.

2335
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm sure you've seen your siblings.
Joo Dan.

2336
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,480
Joo Dan.
his real brothers.

2337
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,040
What?

2338
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,320
Joo Dan.
in front of friends or strangers.

2339
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:04,920
So he thought,
Joo Dan.

2340
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,520
Joo Dan.
I know what you're like.

2341
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,600
Song Yeon-ju.

2342
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,000
Lu.
Right?

2343
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,800
They're different.
Lu.

2344
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,040
Yes.
Song Yeon-ju.

2345
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,320
Lu.
Because you're fierce to them.

2346
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,000
Song Yeon-ju.
Yes.

2347
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,240
I've been like this since I was a kid.
Song Yeon-ju.

2348
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,360
Yang Gen.
I beat my brother.

2349
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,080
It's stuck in front of a man.
Yang Gen.

2350
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,720
Yang Gen.
He becomes gentle.

2351
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,160
Mu Chun.
So from a psychological perspective,

2352
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,640
Maybe your brothers
Mu Chun.

2353
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,000
Mu Chun.
a sense of confusion.

2354
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,720
It’s like this
Mu Chun.

2355
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,520
Mu Chun.
It’s like this.

2356
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,200
But suddenly,
Mu Chun.

2357
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,600
I saw her gentle side.
Mu Chun.

2358
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,080
Mu Chun.
Is it still her?

2359
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,040
Is it her?
Mu Chun.

2360
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:37,600
Mu-chun.
if it was her.

2361
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,640
I might even say "IVII".
Joo Dan.

2362
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,240
Joo Dan. Why are you never so gentle to me?

2363
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,240
Yang Gen.
Yes.

2364
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,000
Joo Dan.
Why does this man

2365
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,280
To have your tenderness
Joo Dan.

2366
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,120
Yang Gen.
Yes.

2367
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,240
Joo Dan.
Actually, I have the same question.

2368
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,600
You're siblings and lovers.
Joo Dan.

2369
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,920
Joo Dan.
Do you think he's in a wrong position?

2370
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,640
I feel
One Wood Spring.

2371
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,960
Mu Chun.
because of the bond between brothers.

2372
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,560
Very deep.
Mu Chun.

2373
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,040
Joo Dan.
Yes.

2374
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,120
Mu Chun.
So it's easy to get into yourself.

2375
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,160
Mu Chun.
For example,

2376
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
When I saw my brother’s confession,
Mu Chun.

2377
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,920
Mu Chun.
I felt awkward.

2378
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,400
Mu Chun: He always adds this kind of occupation.

2379
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,680
Mu Chun.
It’s three times more than normal friends.

2380
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,720
He’s very immersed in himself. Yeah.
Mu Chun.

2381
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,480
Yang Gen.
Lu, have you ever seen your brother in a relationship?

2382
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,560
Lu.
I think I always have

2383
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,000
Deep.
Lu.
I think I always have

2384
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,240
Lu,
I think it's better

2385
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,160
may be better.
Lu,

2386
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,240
When Lu sees his brother in love,

2387
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,360
Lu.
I kind of understand the concept of siblings.

2388
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,160
It feels like
Lu.

2389
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,320
Deer seems to be in love with a clone of himself.

2390
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,800
Lu.
Look at him.

2391
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,160
It's a bit like
Lu.

2392
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,720
Lu.
It's a bit like his IVI Aichie in life.

2393
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,800
He's like him in life.
Lu.

2394
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,360
Lu.
He's the guy you're with.

2395
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,960
He looks like the man in the original camera.
Lu.

2396
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
Joo Dan.
(He's in love like the man after his beauty.)

2397
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,080
Lu,
Don't pretend to be IVII.

2398
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,760
You think you should stop pretending.
Lu,

2399
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Lu.
You're not like that.

2400
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,120
No, you're not like that.
Lu.

2401
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,520
I'm not an assistant.
Lu.

2402
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,880
Lu.
My brother used to have IVII Isami.

2403
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:41,960
My brother used to
Lu.
My brother used to have IVII Isami.

2404
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,360
Lu.
tried to pursue my best friend.

2405
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,400
I said no.
Lu.

2406
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,120
Lu.
Don't say yes.

2407
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,520
No.
Lu.

2408
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,800
Joo Dan.
Is it possible that

2409
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,080
I don't know enough.
Joo Dan.

2410
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,400
Lu.
But maybe it's too much.

2411
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,160
Yang Gen.
That's enough.

2412
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,480
Yang Gen.
When you met your husband,

2413
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,120
How much did your brother participate in?
Yang Gen.

2414
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,040
My brother knew the result.
Lu.

2415
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,000
Yang Gen.
He must be shocked.

2416
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,360
My sister found a foreigner.
Yang Gen.
He must be shocked.

2417
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,600
Yang Gen.
My sister found a foreigner.

2418
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,840
Yang Gen.

2419
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,560
Lu,
Yes, but he seems to accept it very soon.

2420
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,320
I think my family
Lu,

2421
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,760
Lu.
I'm quite shocked about that.

2422
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,000
Because before
Lu.

2423
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,160
Lu.
before I took my husband back.

2424
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:10,840
They are
Lu.

2425
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,640
Lu has never contacted any foreigner.

2426
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,000
We'll be back soon.
But...

2427
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,680
Soon,
We'll be back soon.

2428
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,920
Lu.
accept the fact soon.

2429
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,560
It feels like a family
Lu.

2430
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,880
Xiaolu.
is implanted.

2431
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,760
like virus.
Xiaolu.

2432
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,720
Lord Wu.
They may have a sense of freshness.

2433
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,640
Lu.
I feel

2434
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,680
My family is like IVII.
Lu.

2435
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,800
Lu.
They are still in this aspect.

2436
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,440
He thinks you like it.
Lu.

2437
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,480
Lu.
He doesn't intervene in your affairs too much. If...

2438
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,040
Yang Gen.
The two hidden brothers in the next episode.

2439
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,080
Yang Gen.
It's a tricky problem.

2440
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,840
Lu.
I have no clue.

2441
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,320
It can be said that
Lu.

2442
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,720
Yang Gen.
no clue.

2443
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,200
Yes.
Yang Gen.

2444
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,880
Joo Dan.
Harry's team's brother.

2445
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,760
gave us
Joo Dan.

2446
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,480
Joo Dan.
to us.

2447
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,640
We're not confident.
Joo Dan.

2448
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,480
Yang Gen.
Yes.

2449
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,000
We're looking forward to
Yang Gen.

2450
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,920
Yang Gen.
the last two brothers.

2451
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,720
Who and who are a family?
Yang Gen.

2452
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,400
Yang Gen.
We'll wait for the next episode.

2453
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,920
Meanwhile, in the next episode,
Yang Gen.

2454
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,120
Yang Gen.
we will announce

2455
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,760
The life album of the members of the cabin.
Yang Gen.

2456
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Yang Gen.
Let's look forward to it.

2457
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,000
Love Sisters.
Yang Gen.

2458
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,960
Let love double
Close.

2459
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,640
We have a new guest.

2460
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,000
Newbie.

2461
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,520
Hello.

2462
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,320
He looks like

2463
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,279
a bossy CEO.

2464
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,479
I had a high first impression of him.

2465
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:19,720
He makes me feel threatened.

2466
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,080
and hostile.

2467
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,680
This boy will make my brothers

2468
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,120
have a better choice.
