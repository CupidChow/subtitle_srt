1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,400
love

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
Hello.

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Hello

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
What are you cooking?

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
I only know how to cook soup.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,320
My limit.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,759
Hello, Yinbo.

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,520
Hello.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,240
You are washing vegetables

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
I'm done.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,240
So fast?

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,080
The stupid bird flies first.

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,160
Flower.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,440
Okay.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,520
One dish for each.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,479
Think about what to cook.

25
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll cook Chaoshan beef.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,200
I'll make you a seafood.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,160
and Ningbo cuisine.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Go downstairs.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,200
A letter.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
(To members of the house.)

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
The first dinner in the house

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,240
It's the taste of moms

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,480
This is the last dinner of the house tonight.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Please make one dish respectively

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,600
and end this journey.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,520
Hello.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
Do you want to cut it yourself?

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,880
You want to make beans?

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
Your beans are so old.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,200
To be honest,

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Isn't this the same as you?

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
The beans are definitely older than me.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,800
An old man should eat some old beans.

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
You need to cook it.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm scared.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
Didn't you say it's cooked?

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Anyway, Yinbo, you eat first.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,120
Really?

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Then one less confessing tomorrow.

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
I was afraid that Yinbo would confess.

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll poison him to death today.

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,800
Who's home?

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Brother.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
Why are you three cooking together?

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,320
What do you think? Is this scene awkward?

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
I had a barbecue with Tae-seo yesterday.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,600
We'll cook together today.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,240
Is there a problem?

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,960
Yes.

60
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
I don't think it's me and Tae-seo.

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,840
Brother.

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,680
Guess what I made.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
Fried pork with chili.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,640
No.

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Fried eggs with chili.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
I bought something. I'll make it later.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,160
You guys go ahead.

68
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll go upstairs first.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
How was your date today?

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,040
What do you think?

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,560
We're on a date today.

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,720
I asked him

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
Zero to ten.

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,560
Zero means no feeling.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,800
Ten means love.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,720
How much am I to him?

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
He said 9.5.

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,240
Then I said,

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Really?

80
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,079
Then he said

81
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,120
Then I said what you said

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
will become evidence in court.

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
He said he knew.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm going downstairs to check my dish.

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

86
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
What are you doing?

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Fried pork with chili.

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Although I can't cook it

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
Just do it.

90
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Let your men help you.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Where are my brothers?

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Tell him to come back and help me.

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,880
You can prepare those to be cut first.

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
I've never cut anything.

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,600
Try it.

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,320
I can help you.

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
This dish is for you.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Here you are.

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
It's okay. I can cut something for you.

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,279
If you're afraid of cutting your hands,

101
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,320
Okay.

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
Give me the knife.

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm smiling.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
Let me try.

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,960
You can't do it. Don't.

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,480
Why?

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Why can't I?

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm afraid you'll cut your hand.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
Stop cutting your hands.

110
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Why don't you try it first?

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,320
Let you try it.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Yes, slowly.

113
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,960
But I think I cut this too thick.

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,280
Forget it. It's thick.

115
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,080
Then cut the chili for me.

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Forget it. I'll do this.

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Go get the chili.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Let me do it.

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
I'll change this.

120
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,720
Half and half.

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,880
Go get the green pepper.

122
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
And garlic and ginger.

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,760
Yes, get the ginger with garlic.

124
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
We'll put it away after you finish.

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
We'll fry it after they finish.

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,760
Okay.

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Map.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,080
You play with it?

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,560
No.

130
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,240
When they're done,

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll cook that for Xiaoling.

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,120
Play with it.

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,880
Why don't you go and see Xiao Ling?

134
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,840
with chili?

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm really worried. You two have fun.

136
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
Let's take a look.

137
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

138
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
The soup is back.

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,640
Let me see where you fell.

140
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
This...

141
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,080
Look.

142
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
You're bleeding.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,240
Let me see.

144
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,440
This...

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
Poor thing.

146
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Are you bleeding from inside?

147
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
There's a lot of blood inside.

148
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,240
Nose.

149
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,440
What is Su Ziyi cooking?

150
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,600
Sorry.

151
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,480
Soup, what's wrong with you?

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
Poor thing.

153
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,520
I feel bad for you.

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
You...

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
I'm fine.

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
Does it still hurt?

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,440
Touching it still hurts.

158
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,000
You don't need me, Su Ziyi.

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
I need you. Don't go.

160
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,760
Please don't leave me.

161
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
Pour me some oil, Su Zihao.

162
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,560
What oil?

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,200
I love oil.

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Please.

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,160
Stir-fry.

166
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,400
Just pull the back like this.

167
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,760
There's action guidance next to it.

168
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes.

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
Take a seat.

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,760
and then come back to “poison” them.

171
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
They should be ready soon.

172
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't know. I have to cook.

173
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,600
I hope you'll be fine tomorrow.

174
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,160
Why are you wearing matching shirts with me?

175
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Learn from me.

176
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
The morning I went out first.

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
Whose dishes are we missing now?

178
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,640
Just Tom's dish.

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,800
Su Ziyi helps Tom.

180
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
I'll cheer for you.

181
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Okay.

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,720
Come on, Tom.

183
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
Then don't. It's more stressful.

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,920
No eggs.

185
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
We're out

186
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,480
Bro.

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,760
No.

188
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,960
The sky has collapsed.

189
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
I can only make eggs.

190
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Tom, the sky has collapsed.

191
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,080
Eggs!

192
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
No, I have to go.

193
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
It'll be fun if you can't make one.

194
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,800
There are eggs.

195
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
I bought eggs

197
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,960
It's too thick actually.

198
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
I found it.

199
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,880
Right?

200
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,320
It's okay.

201
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
This is our first time.

202
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Here.

203
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
Pour it on me.

204
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,960
It said pouring a spoon.

205
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't know how much a spoon is.

206
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,000
You say stop.

207
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
It's okay.

208
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,360
There's no need for too much sugar.

209
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
So much.

210
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,560
OK. Come on.

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
I'll cook it.

212
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,280
This dish has become yours.

213
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
End the rest.

214
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
It's almost done.

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,520
Put the chili down a little.

216
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
Fried an egg.

217
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Two lucky eggs.

218
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Whoever gets it will get it.

219
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
and put the eggs there.

220
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
You have this skill?

221
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,440
He made it.

222
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,000
No.

223
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
You've improved a bit.

224
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
You left me behind.

225
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
No, Xiao Ling did it.

226
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
Your sister is the best.

227
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,679
The sky has collapsed.

228
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,760
Let's talk at home.

229
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,679
I heard you're cooking in the show.

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,360
Make me one

231
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,880
I said I'll fry the eggs.

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
Xiao Ling said, stir-fried pork with chili.

233
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Tom, do you need any help?

234
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Help me here.

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll cheer for you.

236
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,880
Okay.

237
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Give you some pressure.

238
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
Put pressure on me.

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,880
Draw it from here.

240
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Hurry up.

241
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,760
OK.

242
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Fatty taught me new Cantonese.

243
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,880
Two spoons of soy sauce and one spoon of vinegar.

244
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Can I put it now?

245
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay, that's enough

246
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
I made a big portion.

247
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:17,840
Stewed ribs with potatoes

248
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Stewed ribs with potatoes

249
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Stewed ribs with potatoes.

250
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Spin.

251
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,800
I think this dish is too big.

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,920
Have some.

253
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Try the poison?

254
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,280
Try it.

255
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
It's actually something I don't like.

256
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
And it's muddy again.

257
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,160
Do you think it's okay?

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,880
Awesome, right?

259
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,120
Is it done?

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,240
I'll serve it if it's done.

261
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,280
Whose crab is this?

262
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,360
Did you make this

263
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
So awesome.

264
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,920
Tae-seo can do this.

265
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
And lobsters.

266
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
I'll pay for it today.

267
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Magic.

268
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,720
Tae-seo lost himself

269
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
(Tae-seo lost himself.)

270
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,680
Fall in!

271
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,640
Come on.

272
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,360
Three two one

273
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,760
It feels like the first day, my family

274
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,080
This is our first meal

275
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,840
Come on

276
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,760
Let me do it.

277
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,720
No, three, two.

278
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,160
Three, two.

279
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
Turn your nose to the left.

280
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Su Zihao said you were like a straight stone.

281
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,880
like a straight stone.

282
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,480
Like this.

283
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,760
Seriously?

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
It's me. I'm scared.

285
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,240
I will cry.

286
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,880
Yes, I'll be scared to death.

287
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,040
If you scream, don't you scream?

288
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,280
No, I thought my nose was broken.

289
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,040
I dare not move.

290
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,320
Because there's only one nose

291
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
only one nose.

292
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
Because my nose is too high.

293
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,600
I slept

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,160
I jumped up from the bed.

295
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,760
I sat on the bed while sleeping.

296
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,560
I found myself naked.

297
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
I put my clothes on.

298
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,400
You even wore the clothes upside down at night, you know?

299
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
I strangled you all night.

300
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
Why do I feel like someone is strangling me when I sleep?

301
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,480
He doesn't scream or cry.

302
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,720
He's not noisy.

303
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,680
What do you think?

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Not bad.

305
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,840
No.

306
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Yes, thank you.

307
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,680
Why are you eating something without meat?

308
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
This is for you.

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,680
Give me those without meat.

310
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,120
Okay.

311
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,680
I support Susu.

312
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
Is this delicious?

313
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,960
Yes.

314
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,440
I can feel Terri's chef (cooking).

315
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
Try Xin's.

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,920
tender beef.

317
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,200
Chili is also delicious

318
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,680
The meat is delicious too

319
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
The fried pork with chili is really delicious.

320
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,800
Me too

321
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,480
Really?

322
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Really

323
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,040
And chili is delicious

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
It's my first time cooking

325
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
So delicious.

326
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,600
It's my first time eating Xiaoling's cooking.

327
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,280
Me too.

328
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Cherish this last meal.

329
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
The last dinner.

330
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
That's sad.

331
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,440
Don't say that, okay?

332
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
I can only say

333
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,800
I didn't get along well enough.

334
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,920
I really hate to part with you.

335
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,800
I hate parting.

336
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
I think this is cruel.

337
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
But it's also very realistic.

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm quite used to

339
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
the life we live together every day.

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,720
Time really flies.

341
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
In the past two days,

342
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
I gradually realized that I'm leaving.

343
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to leave.

344
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,840
There's a text.

345
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
A text?

346
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,600
What do you mean?

347
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,960
Pick one between A and B.

348
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Go alone.

349
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,160
I'll go then.

350
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
Go ahead.

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,240
(To members of the house.)

352
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,200
Before the confession,

353
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,080
To make everyone

354
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
their feelings better.

355
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,480
Next, we'll talk about the truth.

356
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,560
Talk about your partner with your brother.

357
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
I'll ask him a question instead of my brother.

358
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,600
The questions are not allowed.

359
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,160
There are four people who want to be a couple

360
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,760
They want to be a couple.

361
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,680
Six people are still considering the final choice.

362
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,880
The court will be here soon.

363
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,400
Let me tell you.

364
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
This must be the court.

365
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,240
Looking forward to Su Zihao.

366
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,520
ask some questions

367
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
that I'm too shy to ask.

368
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,360
Are you afraid I'll ask you?

369
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
No.

370
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,360
Really?

371
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,320
Go ahead.

372
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,480
Is there anything else you want to ask?

373
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm thinking. Wait.

374
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,120
Help me ask him.

375
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,840
Send it to me.

376
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I thought about something.

377
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,400
Do you want me to ask?

378
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,160
I actually think

379
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,320
you don't want to give a grade.

380
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
That would be awkward.

381
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,880
Lower the price.

382
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay.

383
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,480
No, no.

384
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
Ask Xiao Ling first.

385
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Okay.

386
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,760
Okay, edit the memo.

387
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
If you have any questions,

388
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,320
you can tell me.

389
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,000
I have no questions.

390
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,840
So you have questions?

391
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,120
No, I want to ask all of them.

392
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,960
I want to ask all of them.

393
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
I can only choose one.

394
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,480
Sit here.

395
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,680
Let me show you my question.

396
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Which one do you want to ask?

397
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,840
I think this is OK.

398
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
You can ask.

399
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Let's start.

400
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay, I'll ask first.

401
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
Quiet.

402
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,600
That's right.

403
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
Tu Tu, you went on a date

404
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
with my sister today.

405
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,480
Actually,

406
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,920
it's better to be peaceful.

407
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
Are you one of the four

408
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
or among the six?

409
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,600
Among the six,

410
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,160
both of us think

411
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,080
I think confessing and being together

412
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
to face.

413
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,240
We can't

414
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,160
because we haven't confirmed our feelings.

415
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
But as time covers us,

416
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,800
let's confess our love.

417
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
I think

418
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,040
doesn't fit our feelings.

419
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,560
Because we both chose

420
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,680
love each other for a long time.

421
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
Since we have

422
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,920
the freshness of emotions,

423
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,120
I think it's moving towards the right direction.

424
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,520
It's not about sprouting.

425
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,680
you have to say

426
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,880
and force it to make a fruit.

427
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,320
Yes.

428
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,720
Okay.

429
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,960
Among your relationship with Xiaoling,

430
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
what's your biggest concern now?

431
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,080
I think

432
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
is distance.

433
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,800
and some things

434
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,560
we need to face.

435
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
I'll graduate in two years.

436
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,840
She will graduate in two years.

437
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,880
So during this period,

438
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,200
we can't change our position

439
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,240
to change our position.

440
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
Only one can be in Hangzhou,

441
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,040
and the other in Beijing.

442
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,160
I think this is

443
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,560
my biggest concern.

444
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
I'll leave a question for you.

445
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Okay, next.

446
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,319
You have another question.

447
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,160
Let me ask.

448
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,599
Let's change seats.

449
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

450
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,079
I thought you had imagined the future

451
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,800
you had already imagined the future.

452
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,520
Do you think the future

453
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,640
are you just joking

454
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,760
or are you confident

455
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,560
that you two will have this future?

456
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,160
So sharp.

457
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm doing a lot of things

458
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,960
long-term things.

459
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,440
I can't see the effect for the time being.

460
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
or make money.

461
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,040
I don't like it either.

462
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,880
Because I ask my family for money when I'm in a relationship.

463
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
I think

464
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,960
Susu and I have no such concerns.

465
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
Because what Susu values

466
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
is the sincerity,

467
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,480
instead of

468
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,800
the value of money.

469
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,600
I think

470
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
I can stick to

471
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
for a long time.

472
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,560
and love at the same time.

473
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,520
So this is your confidence.

474
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,360
that you two will have this future?

475
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,440
Do you think you're confident enough?

476
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,920
What do you want

477
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,440
to be confident?

478
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
I think

479
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,680
I mean,

480
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,520
There are many girls who don't need to spend their money.

481
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,040
Then why is it her?

482
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
I like her.

483
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
My first reaction wasn't very happy.

484
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,040
But I thought it over.

485
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,160
As Su's brother,

486
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,680
he hopes his brother

487
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,000
the best.

488
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,160
What do you think

489
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
what else is the percentage of others?

490
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
What about my sister's percentage?

491
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,760
I think

492
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,480
80 percent.

493
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,440
or 30 percent.

494
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Because I...

495
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm quite casual.

496
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
I can do anything.

497
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,360
I can't eat spicy food.

498
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,120
it's very compulsive.

499
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,000
But I remember

500
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,440
I remember whether you quarreled

501
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,360
or stubborn,

502
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,040
You rejected my sister twice.

503
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,800
She wants to talk to you.

504
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,160
It's not obvious.

505
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,280
Isn't it 80 percent?

506
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,320
70 percent?

507
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,080
It's like 60 percent.

508
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,760
40 percent.

509
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
I was crying.

510
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,120
Well...

511
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,800
Because I hate

512
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,680
chatting and angry.

513
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,400
So I promise I won't say anything

514
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
when I talk.

515
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
In that situation,

516
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
I was afraid I would say something that would hurt her.

517
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
So I chose...

518
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
I said let's talk tomorrow.

519
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,040
This is right.

520
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,920
Because I saw his eyes red.

521
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,440
I thought he was crying.

522
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,160
But he was stubborn.

523
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,240
He said he didn't cry.

524
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,840
I didn't expect

525
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
I was disturbing him when he was crying.

526
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Okay, next question.

527
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,440
If my sister wasn't the first one to come in,

528
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
there's no room for you two to be alone.

529
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,240
You'll like the first one to come in.

530
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,400
who came in first?

531
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,520
No.

532
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
If a

533
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,920
a very cool girl,

534
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
Do you like that cool girl

535
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
or my sister whom I first met?

536
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
Susu.

537
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,080
Why?

538
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm already in love.

539
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm very shy.

540
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
and sorry.

541
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,400
It's a bit too straightforward.

542
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
It makes me feel

543
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,800
improved.

544
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
in front of others.

545
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,200
in front of others.

546
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,520
Maybe he wants to prove himself to me.

547
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,600
I think when I love someone,

548
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,960
When I want to get close to her,

549
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,760
to break through

550
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
and do what you've never done.

551
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,560
Okay, I...

552
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Are you ready?

553
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,600
Tata, sit over there.

554
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,200
You like him

555
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,920
just because he's considerate to you?

556
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,440
If someone else

557
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
does everything to you,

558
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,920
you'll still like him, right?

559
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
That's a sharp question.

560
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
Let me think about it.

561
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
I only met Harry.

562
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
At first,

563
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,640
with Harry at first.

564
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,400
And I chose him.

565
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,640
After that,

566
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
he did these things to me,

567
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,440
he was really touched.

568
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,600
And in the beginning,

569
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I was interested in him.

570
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
So...

571
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,800
Do you think you'll regret

572
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
because you regret not meeting others?

573
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't regret it now.

574
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,200
About the situation of a foreign relationship,

575
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
Su Zihao has been trying to solve it.

576
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
What do you think?

577
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
How long are you going to see him?

578
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I think we should meet every month.

579
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Really?

580
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
That is...

581
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,280
See you.

582
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,560
I feel like I have to see him every month.

583
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,760
and every month

584
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,440
or every month.

585
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,920
It's not the time for you to ask questions.

586
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,680
Who asked?

587
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,800
He was in a hurry.

588
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,600
To be exact,

589
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
How do you solve

590
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
the problem of meeting?

591
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,520
Because he has to go to school and you have to work.

592
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
And...

593
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,560
Tokyo to London

594
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,040
13 or 14 hours.

595
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
13 hours and 25 minutes.

596
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
I said we should meet every month.

597
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,080
the hardship I have to overcome

598
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,280
is the three months approaching.

599
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,760
to overcome these three months.

600
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,680
Because I just signed a contract with the company,

601
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,280
I might not be able to leave.

602
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
If

603
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,920
I don't have a job,

604
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
I can apply for leave in advance.

605
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,760
Like this.

606
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
If I can leave, I will leave.

607
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
It's true that my work

608
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,360
is very unstable.

609
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,080
I may think about

610
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,000
my career and work first.

611
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes, because Su Zihao is in school.

612
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
he must have no way

613
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,600
he can't fly

614
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
fly to other places.

615
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,000
So I don't think

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
he can fly to another country

617
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,440
he can fly to another country.

618
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,760
And it's not a few hours.

619
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
It's more than ten hours.

620
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Yes.

621
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
I can only do my best

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,880
to balance this problem.

623
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm sure

624
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,520
we'll discuss it later.

625
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,920
I...

626
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
If we didn't meet for a month,

627
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,120
I think it's acceptable.

628
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,480
I thought Susu was really

629
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
on the opposite side.

630
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,920
She is on Su Zihao's side.

631
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,160
Her desire and meeting

632
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,280
is more like what Su Zihao

633
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
before.

634
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,160
She probably said

635
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,640
She's afraid that if I say I want to go,

636
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,760
but I can't.

637
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,120
It makes Su Zihao feel insecure.

638
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
I'm not satisfied with her answer.

639
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,560
I know she can't be sure about this.

640
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,000
It's like drawing "pancake".

641
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,080
I hope this pastry

642
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
is the pastry that I can eat,

643
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
instead of "pancake" that doesn't exist.

644
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,680
Yes.

645
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Su Zihao needs a sense of security in a relationship.

646
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
How are you going to give him a sense of security?

647
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I see. He's super anxious.

648
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,800
He has no sense of security.

649
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,560
But I am

650
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,720
in a relationship,

651
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,120
in a relationship.

652
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,520
Actually, I can give

653
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
a lot of sense of security.

654
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,840
I just need to settle down with the other person.

655
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,960
Once I've made up my mind,

656
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,760
I trust him unconditionally.

657
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,040
If he needs this sense of security,

658
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,960
what does he need?

659
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
I'll ask him directly.

660
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
And

661
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
after knowing the solution he wants,

662
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
I'll try my best to satisfy him.

663
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay, no problem.

664
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,400
The sharp Mi is online.

665
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
Are you four or six?

666
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm four.

667
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,720
If

668
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,080
you have conflicts with the soup,

669
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,360
will you be angry?

670
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Or do you

671
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,920
with him

672
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,040
with him.

673
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,200
I'll say it out of anger.

674
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,880
If you are

675
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,280
in a very contradictory situation,

676
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,000
After a while,

677
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,560
before I can solve the problem.

678
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,600
How long will you stay calm?

679
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,080
And your calmness means you don't text

680
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,880
or you don't want to meet him?

681
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,440
Or...

682
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,120
I think it depends on my mood.

683
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,440
I think if I don't text her,

684
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,960
it may last for a short time.

685
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,520
But if I'm

686
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
when I'm angry,

687
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,000
if you come to see me,

688
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,120
if you come to see me.

689
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,160
Because I'm soft-hearted.

690
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,680
I can't

691
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
to come to see me.

692
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,680
to see me.

693
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,760
And I just don't want to see him.

694
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,120
I can't do such a thing.

695
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,360
Okay.

696
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,960
Xiao Ling asked Susu because I asked her to.

697
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
I was afraid that I would hear

698
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
I don't want to hear.

699
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,000
In your opinion,

700
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,960
both parties are equal in love?

701
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,600
Or do you think

702
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,320
girls need to enjoy

703
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,040
being favored.

704
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,200
I want to put the ugliest words

705
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,880
and the most difficult problem

706
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,200
to solve.

707
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,560
And I think

708
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,400
I think it's better to walk.

709
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,360
I definitely hope to be loved more.

710
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,360
Yes.

711
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
But I think

712
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,880
51 percent, 49 percent.

713
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,640
Okay.

714
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,120
Okay.

715
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,600
Got it.

716
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
I think girls

717
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
want more preference.

718
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
I think this is what every girl

719
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,880
all girls want.

720
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
Love me a little more

721
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,400
to love me a little more.

722
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,080
She thinks boys need to pay more attention.

723
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,000
But she can be

724
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,680
51%.

725
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,640
She is 49 percent.

726
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,240
Actually, I'm quite satisfied.

727
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm happy to hear this answer.

728
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,280
That's all.

729
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
You scared me.

730
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
I have a question for Hua.

731
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,440
Do you think

732
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,000
our friendship

733
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,120
change our friendship

734
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,600
because of fat?

735
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,840
I think you are influenced.

736
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm not.

737
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,840
Okay.

738
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
I think I'm fine.

739
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,640
I care about this.

740
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
I think we can

741
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,040
we can

742
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,880
talk alone after this.

743
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Because we really didn't

744
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,640
serious

745
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,360
and had a chat alone.

746
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,200
She might think I might have neglected her

747
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
or I wasn't very enthusiastic to her.

748
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,680
She thought maybe I was influenced.

749
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,840
So I thought

750
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,920
I might

751
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,880
talk to her again today.

752
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
Actually, my question is very simple.

753
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,240
But this question

754
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,880
I want to ask you why

755
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,520
why you sent it to Xinxin.

756
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,440
Because that text message was after going back to the room.

757
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,800
And I think

758
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
with Esther.

759
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
We had more interactions.

760
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,920
And at that time,

761
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,600
send that message to Xinxin.

762
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,360
But I didn't know.

763
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,920
And I didn't know it until very last.

764
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
I never knew.

765
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,200
this message

766
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
caused a misunderstanding to Xinxin.

767
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
Because she thought it was from Harry.

768
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,160
I don't have any other questions.

769
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
You first, I first.

770
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,560
Me first.

771
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,920
I'll ask some questions for Tae-seo.

772
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Sure.

773
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,840
Go ahead.

774
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,840
If Tae-seo had been in the house from the beginning,

775
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,160
would you choose Tae-seo more firmly?

776
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,440
If I didn't

777
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
he wouldn't have...

778
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,120
He's not someone you fell in love with at first sight.

779
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,080
Not me?

780
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Who is it?

781
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,680
You.

782
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,480
Yes.

783
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,120
I may have the order.

784
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,840
is not very important.

785
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,040
It should be important to Flower.

786
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,760
Because Hua was fat at the beginning.

787
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,320
If

788
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,240
to show up at the same time as them,

789
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,600
maybe she just wants to know me.

790
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
After meeting Tae-seo,

791
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,960
has Tae-seo always been your best choice?

792
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,720
Not always.

793
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,680
Are you still hesitating

794
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,800
your own choice and feelings?

795
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,080
No.

796
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,680
I prepared a question in advance.

797
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
to ask Hua for me.

798
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
And Tata's brother

799
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,560
has some questions for Harry.

800
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,760
So I pretend to be

801
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
Lingkai (Tata's brother).

802
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,520
Okay.

803
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,520
Are you ready?

804
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,680
Revenge for me too.

805
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,240
If the problem is not sharp,

806
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,920
just scare him with your tone.

807
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
The tone?

808
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
After getting in touch with Tata,

809
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,080
did you regret

810
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,880
what you did in the house?

811
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
I regret being angry with her.

812
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,320
What do you mean?

813
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
I was angry at her at the ball.

814
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,480
Later,

815
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,760
she said something that made me angry.

816
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,800
I get angry with her too.

817
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,600
Are you satisfied, my sister?

818
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,520
These answers...

819
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,760
I'll keep asking him if he's not satisfied.

820
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,360
Then you continue.

821
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,800
For example,

822
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,600
you regret your quarrel with Tata.

823
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,160
Have you ever thought about what to do next?

824
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,480
to make it happen

825
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,440
and not regret it?

826
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,120
It's not my fault.

827
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,360
It's not my fault.

828
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,000
I didn't quarrel with her.

829
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,680
I just didn't want to talk to her.

830
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,920
It wasn't my fault,

831
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,200
but it could be my fault

832
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,040
it could be my problem.

833
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,040
I didn't expect him to say that.

834
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,960
He stressed that

835
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Although it's not his fault,

836
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,520
I feel like you're pushing me to the edge of the wind.

837
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,600
Maybe I thought too much.

838
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,720
But I was shocked when I heard it.

839
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,640
So, have you ever regretted

840
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,080
about your regret?

841
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,160
Of course.

842
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,600
Show us.

843
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,840
Since she told me

844
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
I texted her officially.

845
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,080
I sent her

846
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,080
I sent it to her every night.

847
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,240
the night before

848
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,560
or the next morning.

849
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,000
After you edit the text,

850
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
I'll sit down

851
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,280
I'll sit down

852
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,400
and edit the texts from this day.

853
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,920
That's why I texted her every day.

854
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,800
every day.

855
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Or like this. A lot.

856
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,840
The last question.

857
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,040
Play Suzu's voice.

858
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Just release it.

859
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,560
Speaker on.

860
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,280
Because most of your time

861
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,880
in the show.

862
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,920
How long do you think

863
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,520
for Tata?

864
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,320
I think my passion for Tata

865
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,040
for Tata.

866
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
I think as long as we are together,

867
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,120
my passion will never fade.

868
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,280
Because if my passion fades,

869
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,120
we won't be together.

870
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,280
How can you guarantee that?

871
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,600
Two people who like each other

872
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
The topic will never end.

873
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
The weather is different every day.

874
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,040
I think we talk about different things every day

875
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,520
and share different things.

876
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,880
This passion will always

877
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
When you have nothing to say,

878
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,520
when you have nothing to say.

879
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
When it comes to action,

880
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,280
we go on a trip.

881
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,920
So many countries

882
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
and so many cities.

883
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,280
Right?

884
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,760
I'll just...

885
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,160
I just follow her.

886
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,080
Yes.

887
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,520
He's an idealist.

888
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,240
He thinks love can overcome everything.

889
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,600
But

890
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,920
at the beginning,

891
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
I think

892
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,360
there must be a problem between them.

893
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,560
I don't know

894
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,640
whether this problem can be solved.

895
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,680
So I think I can't say

896
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,360
this love can overcome everything.

897
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
Are you satisfied?

898
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,360
Okay.

899
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,160
Satisfied?

900
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
Okay, go ahead.

901
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
I want to ask Xiao Ling.

902
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Here, I'll take a seat.

903
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
I know your family through the video.

904
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,680
You're a great family.

905
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,560
The map

906
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,200
is excellent in my heart,

907
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
compared to you,

908
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,320
compared to you.

909
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,280
Do you mind

910
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,000
a match?

911
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I don't mind.

912
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
Not at all.

913
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,480
Will your thoughts

914
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,280
change according to your family?

915
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,080
The relationship I had before

916
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,560
I didn't tell my mom.

917
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
But she guessed it.

918
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,640
She doesn't want me to be with her.

919
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
But in my own relationship,

920
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,560
in my own relationship.

921
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
Actually,

922
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,720
this question before,

923
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,880
but in my heart,

924
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,680
a big

925
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,840
that bothers me.

926
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,240
In my heart,

927
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,800
a good relationship

928
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,280
needs a lot of support.

929
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,840
In fact, it's more about family.

930
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,480
Later, she firmly

931
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,600
she said

932
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,360
she will firmly choose what she likes.

933
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,280
I'm very touched now.

934
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,040
In your industry,

935
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,720
in your industry.

936
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,200
Yes.

937
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,800
Because both of you

938
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,880
Do you think

939
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,640
who can stand temptation?

940
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,480
I think

941
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm really capable.

942
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,080
Very capable.

943
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
You're a very loyal person.

944
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,600
My friends scold me when I'm single-minded.

945
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,400
You're a love lover.

946
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm usually quite sober.

947
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,000
But if I really like someone,

948
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,560
I am...

949
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,280
To put it bluntly,

950
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,200
a very romantic person.

951
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
For example, he's in Hangzhou.

952
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,760
If I really date him,

953
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,560
I would say I would want to move to Hangzhou.

954
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
That's what I thought.

955
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,560
Actually, I think the same way as her.

956
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
Because in fact,

957
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,440
if I really fall in

958
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,960
in a relationship,

959
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm definitely a very romantic person.

960
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,920
I will express my feelings to her every day.

961
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,760
So,

962
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,360
as for the future arrangement,

963
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,000
will definitely approach her.

964
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
I know

965
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,679
you always like

966
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,239
a little older than you.

967
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,159
He's not a person

968
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,639
who can take care of others.

969
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,560
I think

970
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,280
To be honest, I don't need others to take care of me.

971
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
I think I'm quite independent

972
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,920
I'm quite independent.

973
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
I may need someone

974
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
I need someone to take care of me.

975
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,400
Life or

976
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
handling things,

977
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,679
I don't need others to take care of me.

978
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,440
I think you are all good.

979
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Then why are you one of

980
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,600
one of them?

981
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,719
If I get into a relationship,

982
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,840
I will

983
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,560
a lot.

984
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,400
And I'm very romantic.

985
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,560
I didn't feel

986
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,840
I would be chosen firmly,

987
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,480
I dare not take a step forward.

988
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,320
What Xiaoling said today

989
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm actually quite annoyed.

990
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,280
It's annoying.

991
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm angry.

992
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,360
Because I think

993
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,320
you've done a lot

994
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,720
for someone unworthy.

995
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,840
is a bad thing.

996
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,320
I want to tell you

997
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
you are excellent.

998
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,840
You deserve to be loved.

999
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,680
You don't have to

1000
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,600
to take care of others' emotions.

1001
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,360
Got it. That's all.

1002
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
It's my turn.

1003
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm already scared.

1004
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,880
First of all,

1005
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,640
You said you wanted to

1006
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
in a relationship.

1007
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,720
How far do you think

1008
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,200
have you observed?

1009
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,760
If the progress is 100 percent,

1010
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
I think

1011
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,720
70 to 80 percent.

1012
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,280
This area

1013
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,120
you told me

1014
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
you are the one

1015
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,560
in a relationship.

1016
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,960
Do you mind long-distance relationship?

1017
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,440
A long-distance relationship

1018
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,000
doesn't exist.

1019
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,080
I can fly there

1020
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,520
I can even fly there.

1021
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,120
It's right here.

1022
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,120
There's no long-distance relationship in a relationship.

1023
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Whether it's my job

1024
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,320
and my income,

1025
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I think it can support

1026
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,560
to live in her city.

1027
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,600
I don't care if you're alienated or not.

1028
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,720
I just came.

1029
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,760
You came directly.

1030
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
I'll pick you up.

1031
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,680
I think

1032
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,720
I think Tae-seo is great.

1033
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,600
Think about

1034
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,320
when you decide

1035
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,920
you won't let anyone else know about it.

1036
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm sure it's Hua.

1037
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,440
I remember it clearly.

1038
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
It should be the moment

1039
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,160
when I took photos for her.

1040
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,720
she was really cute in the camera.

1041
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,400
I left a question.

1042
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,680
Okay.

1043
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
Here comes the sharpest question.

1044
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,720
You said you were sincere.

1045
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,440
After you failed to go on a date with Tata,

1046
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,160
you immediately went on a date with Xiaoling

1047
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,680
and asked Xiao Ling.

1048
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,080
Are you happy that I was interviewed?

1049
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,960
What's your definition of sincerity?

1050
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,080
like two people at the same time?

1051
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,440
Or were you lying to Xiaoling?

1052
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,720
I think...

1053
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,280
Why?

1054
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
Actually, Xiao Ling asked me

1055
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,120
this question.

1056
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,480
It's not something

1057
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
to hide.

1058
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,720
But it can't be that

1059
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,520
I'll tell her directly.

1060
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,800
When I first met her,

1061
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,720
I was the second one.

1062
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
That's it.

1063
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,360
It's an awkward question.

1064
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,520
Because at that time,

1065
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,320
in the process.

1066
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,960
It doesn't mean

1067
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,240
I like two people at the same time.

1068
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,760
I think

1069
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,480
It's more possible.

1070
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,880
Back then,

1071
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,520
I went to the interview first.

1072
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,440
I think

1073
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
that day,

1074
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,320
Tata and I were the most

1075
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,680
I get along with her the most.

1076
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,600
So I might want to know her first.

1077
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,600
Why did you

1078
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,320
send the message to Xiaoling that day?

1079
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,480
Because after that day,

1080
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,640
we were always together

1081
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,960
we're always together.

1082
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,040
At that time, I thought

1083
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,160
my feelings

1084
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,400
I want to know more about this side.

1085
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
I asked you yesterday

1086
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,440
whether you're sure about your feelings.

1087
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,640
Your answer is never there.

1088
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,400
Since you're not sure about your feelings,

1089
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
you've been

1090
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,320
giving the signal to Xiaoling.

1091
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Are you looking for a way out for yourself?

1092
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
I mean,

1093
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,240
whether I should

1094
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,440
with her.

1095
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,760
She might think

1096
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,680
my feelings for her and someone else.

1097
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,720
But that's not true.

1098
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,200
Because after that day,

1099
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,480
after we texted each other,

1100
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,320
all the (feelings) texts and all

1101
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,640
The person I went to know was Xiaoling.

1102
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,920
No one else showed up.

1103
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,200
came out halfway.

1104
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,040
Yes.

1105
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,520
This is how I feel.

1106
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,640
Okay.

1107
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,080
This answer seems to be

1108
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,360
When asking questions about the map,

1109
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,680
there are similar answers.

1110
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,800
I feel like

1111
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,600
a function of golden oil.

1112
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,680
It's over.

1113
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,640
That's all.

1114
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,800
Okay, it's over.

1115
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,400
Take your notebook.

1116
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,000
A notebook?

1117
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
You want to see my album?

1118
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
Yes, I haven't.

1119
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,800
No one has seen mine.

1120
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,440
Have you seen mine?

1121
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
I didn't.

1122
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,120
Let me see it again.

1123
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,280
No problem.

1124
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,200
We have only one day left

1125
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,360
I only have one day left.

1126
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,120
I want to see her life album.

1127
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,200
And I want to know more about her.

1128
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,800
Come on.

1129
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
Sister's new birth

1130
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,080
Yours is just born.

1131
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,200
Sister Hua.

1132
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,240
It's really big.

1133
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,720
How much?

1134
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,760
Seven catties.

1135
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,400
A little.

1136
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,400
You have big eyes.

1137
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,720
Joo-hae.

1138
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Let me see.

1139
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,480
No.

1140
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,360
I need to take a good look at this photo.

1141
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
I was in Zhuhai when I was three.

1142
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,600
You really...

1143
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,960
You really...

1144
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm sorry.

1145
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,720
How old are you?

1146
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,680
Five or six years old.

1147
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,920
You had a lot of photos when you were young.

1148
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,720
When I was young.

1149
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,400
I said this when I was young.

1150
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,800
Is this the time to perform on stage?

1151
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,160
It's not good.

1152
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,800
I just want to see yours.

1153
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
Look at yours.

1154
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,040
You can ski, so...

1155
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,360
I skied in Shanghai.

1156
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
I think I only know

1157
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,040
there is an indoor one.

1158
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,120
Yes this is indoor

1159
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,360
There seems to be one near my house.

1160
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
Half an hour.

1161
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,440
A dozen kilometers.

1162
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,840
My friend asked me to go, so I didn't go.

1163
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,640
The snow field

1164
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,960
almost arrived in Suzhou.

1165
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,520
The one next to my house.

1166
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,960
Really?

1167
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,360
We've known each other since you came here last time.

1168
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,280
When did you go there? Tell me.

1169
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,560
November 1st.

1170
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,200
This year,

1171
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,240
I need to see this.

1172
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,320
What? You went there this year?

1173
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,720
No.

1174
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,520
Let me see.

1175
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,000
when my friend called me.

1176
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
Really?

1177
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
November 27th, my friend called me.

1178
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,120
Okay.

1179
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,480
There are still 26 days difference.

1180
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,400
Look at yours.

1181
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,280
Mine is nothing to see.

1182
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,960
Let me see yours. Ugly.

1183
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,320
Look.

1184
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,120
No, I've always been pretty.

1185
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,760
I think so too.

1186
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,000
This is abroad.

1187
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,680
Yes, my sister is going to a show. I'm going to a show.

1188
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,760
Paris. This should be...

1189
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
Tell her to come tomorrow.

1190
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,120
What are you doing? I want to see my sister.

1191
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,720
Yes.

1192
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,280
What do you want to tell her when you see her?

1193
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Sister.

1194
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,640
Yuan Bo is really a good boy.

1195
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
He posted a good guy card when he met him.

1196
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,040
After reading the life album,

1197
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,080
I learned more about it.

1198
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,120
Because

1199
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,920
a chat party between Hua and me.

1200
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,640
After all,

1201
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,720
the last day in the house.

1202
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,560
I think we should take this opportunity

1203
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,920
to express

1204
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,960
in the past

1205
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,600
Tell me. Tell me.

1206
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,040
About the handwritten letter,

1207
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,240
I actually want to know

1208
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,600
what you wrote to Fatty.

1209
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,040
It's about...

1210
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,760
I think

1211
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,480
Tae-seo is good.

1212
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
I think he's good too.

1213
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
I may be hesitating.

1214
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,560
Which one of you

1215
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,600
I want to meet more.

1216
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,520
And

1217
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,480
I didn't write the content directly.

1218
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,960
I thought you might write it to me.

1219
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
I have a date with you.

1220
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,920
But if I write to him,

1221
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,040
I can talk to him

1222
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,760
have a chance

1223
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,240
to talk alone.

1224
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
But he rejected me in that letter.

1225
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,640
He probably

1226
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,440
doesn't want me to be with two people at the same time.

1227
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,080
So the next day,

1228
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,360
I went on a date with you.

1229
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,600
Back then, I was telling you

1230
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,960
I might have a date tonight.

1231
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,800
Yes, I know.

1232
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
But if you two

1233
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,120
write to each other,

1234
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,520
Is it because you two went on a date

1235
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,400
and the second time,

1236
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,120
we might not have this.

1237
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,520
I don't know.

1238
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,080
I think

1239
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,520
a little strange.

1240
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,560
It doesn't make sense logically.

1241
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,280
When you wrote a handwritten letter to him,

1242
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,680
he rejected you.

1243
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,440
right?

1244
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,000
But on the trip to Tianjin,

1245
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,440
I saw him

1246
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,560
I can see him anyway.

1247
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,640
to approach you.

1248
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,000
including seats.

1249
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,800
What do you think about this?

1250
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,480
After rejecting my handwritten letter,

1251
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,200
Didn't we talk on the second floor?

1252
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,440
And?

1253
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,160
He doesn't want me to chase you

1254
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,280
he was chasing me.

1255
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,720
It feels like we're on the same line.

1256
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,800
You run in the front.

1257
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,880
I'm in the middle.

1258
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
He wanted me to stop with him

1259
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,640
and let me get close to you.

1260
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,560
But last night,

1261
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,000
after you came back from the girls' party,

1262
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,520
I heard that

1263
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,480
you almost said

1264
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
you were going to marry Fatty right here.

1265
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,120
Marriage in place is a bit exaggerated.

1266
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,640
Fatty is wild in Guoli.

1267
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,080
Very mature.

1268
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,920
and mature.

1269
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,600
makes people feel at ease.

1270
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,200
I said the moment was touched.

1271
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,800
I see.

1272
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,640
You were thinking about meeting two people.

1273
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,360
Aren't you afraid that I'll be unhappy?

1274
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
I explained it to you.

1275
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,280
So, including

1276
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,520
I texted you about my feelings.

1277
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,040
I also told you that

1278
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,160
I don't want

1279
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,040
between me and Fatty.

1280
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,560
happened to us.

1281
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,040
I don't think

1282
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,080
between us.

1283
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,760
I can feel it.

1284
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,800
Why are you suddenly depressed?

1285
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,680
I don't know.

1286
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,960
I don't think you look happy.

1287
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,560
Then please comfort me.

1288
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,280
Comfort you?

1289
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
Did you do well?

1290
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,520
You're so handsome.

1291
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,840
Did you do your hair today?

1292
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,120
I do it every day.

1293
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,840
Why are you so handsome today?

1294
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,240
Your gray color suits you.

1295
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,960
Last second, I was still angry and unhappy.

1296
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,760
Then next second,

1297
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
how about she praise me in front of me?

1298
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,920
Maybe she's soft-hearted.

1299
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,960
So I was coaxed.

1300
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,320
I think

1301
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,960
the tacit understanding between Hua and me.

1302
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,880
What she does

1303
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,400
makes you feel dizzy.

1304
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,600
Let me give you an example.

1305
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,320
My last girlfriend.

1306
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,360
We were also abroad.

1307
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,440
After I got sick,

1308
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,040
Then she went to Shanghai to find me.

1309
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,600
and stayed with me for a week.

1310
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,800
There will be many things like this.

1311
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,640
Then I will gradually...

1312
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,240
Right.

1313
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,000
Every part of my talk

1314
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,520
for a long time.

1315
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,800
before we got together.

1316
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,560
Have you ever thought

1317
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
your observation period

1318
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
because

1319
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,320
a girl before.

1320
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,560
At first sight,

1321
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,120
It's her.

1322
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,240
She's good at everything.

1323
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,880
Maybe

1324
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,880
this kind of situation.

1325
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,280
Because

1326
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
if I fall for a girl,

1327
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,880
I think you're so pretty.

1328
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,640
I might want to meet you

1329
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,720
and get to know you.

1330
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,240
But if I find out

1331
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,080
you have no feelings for me,

1332
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,600
Then...

1333
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,080
Right?

1334
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,480
Then she likes you too.

1335
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,560
Will she still observe for that long?

1336
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,760
I already like it.

1337
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,680
I will also observe

1338
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,120
Although our living in a small house

1339
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,480
is accelerating.

1340
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,280
I told you before

1341
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,320
I said you got full marks.

1342
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,880
I'll give you seven to eight points now.

1343
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,040
In real life,

1344
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,200
in real life.

1345
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,560
Dream on. Seven to eight.

1346
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,560
Thank you.

1347
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
Thank you.

1348
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,800
But yes

1349
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,720
Yes.

1350
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,200
I mean it.

1351
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,720
But it's really suitable to get to know each other.

1352
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,440
We...

1353
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,280
Because I think

1354
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,320
I have many problems in dating.

1355
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,240
You seem to complement each other.

1356
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,600
I think

1357
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,200
you've been talking about

1358
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,480
your problem.

1359
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,360
Are you pushing me away?

1360
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,400
Yes.

1361
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
I'll try my best to tell you all my questions.

1362
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,160
Then I kept saying

1363
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,480
I have many problems.

1364
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,960
I was childish

1365
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,800
I was childish.

1366
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,560
It's indeed something

1367
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,920
when I'm in a relationship.

1368
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,720
Yeah, didn't you say

1369
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,880
you would tolerate each other?

1370
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
I think I'm quite suitable for this.

1371
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,120
Your current state

1372
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,560
is already the state

1373
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,800
you won't respond so actively.

1374
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,760
You've made a breakthrough.

1375
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,920
Because of your job,

1376
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,200
that makes you feel

1377
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,240
you think there are many girls around me.

1378
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,120
So...

1379
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,800
Is that what you mean?

1380
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,960
No.

1381
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,840
Don't you feel excited about physical contact?

1382
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,200
No.

1383
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,840
How many years

1384
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,560
How many years is it now?

1385
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,160
Almost 11 years.

1386
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,120
There are too many physical contact for couples.

1387
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,200
They even have faces.

1388
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,040
A lot.

1389
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,400
After working together,

1390
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,320
after working together.

1391
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,600
Unless you often work together, right?

1392
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,160
For example, a brand often takes pictures of you two.

1393
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,440
We might get to know each other.

1394
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,560
But if only once in a while,

1395
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,800
you wouldn't even add me on WeChat.

1396
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,800
I didn't know until today

1397
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,720
you chose not to contact anyone

1398
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,040
when you took photos for me.

1399
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,680
So cute.

1400
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,400
Maybe it's because of my appearance.

1401
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,240
I'm pretty on the outside. Thank you.

1402
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,720
Can you change your pose?

1403
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,960
What pose do you want?

1404
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,160
I'm taking a selfie. Why are you hiding?

1405
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,480
narcissistic.

1406
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,240
No way.

1407
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm really taking a selfie.

1408
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,560
See for yourself.

1409
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,000
How is it? Are you leaving?

1410
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,120
How does it feel?

1411
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,400
I want to cry.

1412
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,600
I don't want to leave Bobo.

1413
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Come to Shanghai.

1414
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,200
I'll pick you up in Shanghai.

1415
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,800
About the situation of a foreign relationship,

1416
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Su Zihao has been trying to solve it.

1417
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,240
What do you think?

1418
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,680
How long are you going to see him?

1419
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,680
I can only try my best

1420
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,200
to balance this problem.

1421
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,520
If this is not what I expected,

1422
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,760
I'll try to fix it up to my expectation.

1423
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,960
Whether it's going to Japan,

1424
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,000
or she comes to England.

1425
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,800
Halley hasn't come back yet?

1426
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,920
He's back.

1427
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,840
Yes.

1428
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,200
Do you want to see him?

1429
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,760
I'm in a complicated mood.

1430
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,400
Why?

1431
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,840
The "puppy" is coming.

1432
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:22,680
What's wrong?

1433
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,840
What's wrong, Tata?

1434
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,720
What's wrong? Don't be upset.

1435
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,440
Go, two of you.

1436
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,840
Don't disturb me and Ms. Hua.

1437
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,840
Let's go upstairs.

1438
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,600
Go.

1439
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,760
Say what you want.

1440
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,960
If you're not sad,

1441
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,680
I'm going to bed.

1442
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,480
But if you're sad,

1443
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,640
I'll talk to you.

1444
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,720
You'll regret it if you sleep.

1445
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,240
Go ahead.

1446
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,800
Please.

1447
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,880
I will.

1448
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,160
Okay.

1449
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,840
Okay.

1450
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,080
Say it. Don't say it.

1451
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
Let me explain.

1452
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,640
I've changed a lot.

1453
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,040
To me.

1454
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,680
Tell me.

1455
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,520
I don't know. I feel stressed after talking to you.

1456
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,680
Should I pressure you or myself?

1457
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,600
You pressure me?

1458
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,640
What pressure?

1459
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,800
A lot.

1460
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,320
I can be serious with you

1461
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,200
to talk about this.

1462
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,840
Why do you think I put pressure on you?

1463
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
I'm scared.

1464
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,360
Don't be afraid.

1465
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,040
Tell me.

1466
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,840
About Susu's question,

1467
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,400
about the long-distance question.

1468
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
She said whether I want to see her or not,

1469
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,240
How to balance

1470
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,440
how to make you feel safe.

1471
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,240
Is it you or her?

1472
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,680
I really want to ask this question.

1473
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,120
I don't want to ask you these questions

1474
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,920
in front of so many people.

1475
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,280
I think many questions

1476
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,680
Because I'm a girl.

1477
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,560
I think this question is very cold.

1478
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,120
Very cold.

1479
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,000
I didn't expect Susu to ask me that.

1480
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,200
I think

1481
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,320
there's no warmth

1482
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,360
and emotions.

1483
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,680
I don't know Susu.

1484
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,640
or you.

1485
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,200
What did you say before?

1486
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,280
Love comes first.

1487
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,160
and 10,000 percent.

1488
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
and your answers today

1489
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
I think it doesn't match.

1490
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
Then you said I can't focus on my career.

1491
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,480
But your answer is...

1492
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,280
You said

1493
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,560
you would come to me without my sister and family knowing.

1494
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,480
and not affect your study.

1495
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,800
In fact,

1496
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,160
your study and family

1497
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,320
and family.

1498
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,640
Actually, the question my sister asked...

1499
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,760
listen to her tone.

1500
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,320
is under the premise

1501
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,720
to have this relationship

1502
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,840
to have this relationship.

1503
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,000
But

1504
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,600
I'm a person who will affect my study.

1505
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,200
Dating?

1506
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,000
Of course, I didn't mean

1507
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,960
to affect your study.

1508
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm just saying my own doubts.

1509
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,840
I think

1510
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,240
too full.

1511
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm quite full.

1512
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,520
I think

1513
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,960
you're too confident.

1514
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,680
Because I think

1515
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,760
I will only

1516
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,160
what I can do

1517
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,280
I can do.

1518
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,440
I can't do it. I won't mention it at all.

1519
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,120
Tonight, when you answer those questions

1520
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,400
in front of everyone,

1521
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
I thought you didn't like me.

1522
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,800
You're just answering questions.

1523
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,280
There's no emotion or emotion.

1524
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,360
Diaries exchange time.

1525
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,720
Do you want to take a look?

1526
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,280
I wrote for you.

1527
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,840
I want it.

1528
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,520
I have zero votes.

1529
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,040
No one chose your sister.

1530
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,920
I miss your sister. I'm so sad.

1531
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,760
Okay, stop reading.

1532
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,600
She chose someone else today.

1533
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,480
I don't know what to say.

1534
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,520
I wish I could talk to you.

1535
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,120
I just printed the score.

1536
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,360
I haven't had time to learn.

1537
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,880
My Tears Smashed.

1538
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,080
The name of this song

1539
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,640
suits me well.

1540
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,600
Okay.

1541
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,760
What's wrong?

1542
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,360
Look.

1543
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,760
It's okay.

1544
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,760
Don't cry.

1545
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,840
Am I right?

1546
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,360
I'm not crying because of the map.

1547
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,800
Then what is it?

1548
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,520
Because of what you said.

1549
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,240
What?

1550
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,360
Tell me.

1551
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,360
I said you've started to talk to me.

1552
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Isn't that good?

1553
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,800
In the past,

1554
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,040
You didn't tell me.

1555
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,400
Yes, so I...

1556
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,800
Tom and I

1557
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,720
between Tom and me.

1558
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,840
It has indeed changed.

1559
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,040
Our relationship

1560
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,240
better than before.

1561
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,920
You're under too much pressure.

1562
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,360
Time for the brothers' diary.

1563
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,920
The brothers' diary exchange time.

1564
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,240
I really think

1565
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,120
you don't understand my brother diary.

1566
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,960
My notes are too...

1567
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,400
It's okay.

1568
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:01,840
I was rash.

1569
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,680
You can understand me.

1570
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,720
I'm nervous.

1571
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,240
What?

1572
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,240
I'm a bit busy. I didn't care about you.

1573
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,600
What is this?

1574
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,000
I'm speechless.

1575
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,520
What do these two circles mean?

1576
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,320
My autograph.

1577
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,640
What is this?

1578
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,520
You have to figure it out now.

1579
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,560
Let me see.

1580
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,120
Whatever.

1581
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,600
Next page.

1582
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,920
There are more.

1583
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,840
I want to tear it off.

1584
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,840
Today

1585
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,640
the surname.

1586
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Girls.

1587
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,120
My surname is...

1588
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,400
Please let me go.

1589
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,560
When we were talking,

1590
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,840
I think Tata is also

1591
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,840
Confirm you.

1592
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,440
It's really not me.

1593
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,600
Just take a look.

1594
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,360
Horn stone.

1595
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,920
Seriously.

1596
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,640
A stone corner.

1597
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,880
Look at this.

1598
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,680
I feel your handwriting is written

1599
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
after ten years.

1600
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,680
or I'll be separated.

1601
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,440
Or we'll be close.

1602
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,280
Your handwriting is...

1603
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,000
an artist.

1604
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,720
I believe I'm a very good girl.

1605
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:11,760
And

1606
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,360
I know

1607
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,640
No one can compare with you.

1608
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,480
What about the tower?

1609
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,280
She didn't come at that time.

1610
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,520
What happened after she came?

1611
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,000
What about after that?

1612
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,320
are not on the same level.

1613
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,520
love and friendship.

1614
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:23,800
No.

1615
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,040
Who is your friend?

1616
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,440
You can tell love from family.

1617
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,920
Who is prettier?

1618
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,680
Why don't you tell me?

1619
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,040
Tell me.

1620
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,480
Who is prettier?

1621
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,240
Both of you are pretty.

1622
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,160
No, you have to choose one.

1623
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,120
If it's about my aesthetics

1624
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,240
or my previous aesthetics,

1625
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,600
Not as good as before.

1626
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,480
Who is prettier?

1627
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,840
Only Chaoy and Tata.

1628
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,640
No or

1629
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,600
Wait.

1630
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,360
If she accepts it today,

1631
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,240
No.

1632
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,880
Don't talk.

1633
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,720
She'll look better if she accepts my confession.

1634
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,960
You're better if she doesn't.

1635
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,520
You're the prettiest.

1636
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,440
She accepted the confession

1637
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,080
It means she will be prettier than me in the future.

1638
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,400
You think I'm not as pretty as her?

1639
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,240
Only today.

1640
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,320
She's prettier than me today.

1641
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,040
Today is her shining point.

1642
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,760
What about tomorrow?

1643
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,240
You'll look better tomorrow.

1644
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,000
Okay, okay.

1645
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,240
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

1646
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,360
It's okay.

1647
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,920
Take a look.

1648
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:19,960
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

1649
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,000
You didn't even talk to me.
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

1650
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,880
You didn't even talk to me.

1651
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,360
Isn't it a brother diary?

1652
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,840
You didn't even tell me.

1653
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,560
Central AC, you...

1654
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,200
I have the lifeline of food.

1655
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,840
Yes.

1656
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,880
I don't know why.

1657
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,440
I hope I have some connection with the soup.

1658
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,480
Since the first day

1659
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,360
you two did the dishes together.

1660
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,560
I think you two look good together.

1661
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,400
You scared me.

1662
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,600
Coming.

1663
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
The most dramatic scene.

1664
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,440
I cried a lot today.

1665
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,080
Because with you

1666
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,680
This is the first time

1667
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
since I was a kid.

1668
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,040
Yes.

1669
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,200
Because it's not important,

1670
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,640
because it's not important, right?

1671
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,360
I don't care about you.

1672
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,000
That's why you think it doesn't matter.

1673
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,960
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

1674
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,680
I'm sorry.

1675
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,600
I'm sorry.

1676
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,840
I don't mean to blame you.

1677
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,680
I'll give you another chance.

1678
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,680
Will you speak for me?

1679
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,120
Of course.

1680
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,440
I was a little homesick and cried.

1681
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,520
That day,

1682
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,200
I cried when I was a videotape.

1683
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,760
My dad's face

1684
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,200
That voice

1685
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,280
unfamiliar and familiar.

1686
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,120
I didn't expect

1687
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,400
to see my dad so lively.

1688
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,600
I was really upset that day.

1689
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,520
In the video,

1690
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,760
in the video.

1691
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,800
I thought

1692
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,360
why didn't you call me daughter?

1693
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,520
Did you all see him for the last time?

1694
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,280
I didn't.

1695
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,760
I was there too.

1696
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,920
When I was going in,

1697
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,920
when I was going in.

1698
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,480
He doesn't want me to see

1699
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,360
to see him like that.

1700
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,440
I think I'm small.

1701
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,600
Maybe this is mine too.

1702
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,560
One.

1703
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,360
regret.

1704
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,200
No.

1705
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:54,840
It's okay.

1706
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,240
Hold it.

1707
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,720
Okay.

1708
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,880
He will be happy

1709
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,840
he'll be happy.

1710
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,360
Yes.

1711
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,680
Time for the brothers' diary.

1712
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,160
The brothers' diary exchange time.

1713
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,680
Let's do it.

1714
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,320
Let's switch.

1715
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,240
I'm nervous.

1716
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm afraid I'll cry when I open the first page.

1717
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,760
I saw my sister cooking.

1718
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,880
Really surprised

1719
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,920
Surprised?

1720
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,000
Fatty mustered up the courage to choose Xiaoling.

1721
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,200
You asked me to give Hua a glass tonight.

1722
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,560
I think you're struggling.

1723
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,360
Do I know you well?

1724
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:37,880
Yes.

1725
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,000
A few words include my day.

1726
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,440
Your day starts from

1727
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,320
I feel sorry for Hwa.

1728
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,520
Take it.

1729
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,000
You're really eating my gossip every day.

1730
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,600
Yes.

1731
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,120
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.

1732
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,560
Maybe today's girls' party

1733
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,880
without boys’ interference.

1734
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,960
I know you, right?

1735
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,720
Yes.

1736
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,760
I was really happy that day.

1737
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,520
I saw flowers with my sister today.

1738
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,160
Looking at her

1739
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,160
I had a date, but I didn't want to be hurt.

1740
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,280
At that moment, I really thought

1741
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,640
my sister was very considerate of me.

1742
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,920
Okay.

1743
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,960
You like a girl.

1744
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,840
I also hope that

1745
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,200
can really like you.

1746
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,000
Don't make me cry too.

1747
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,280
Reading sister's letter

1748
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,640
made me cry.

1749
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,360
Let's hold hands

1750
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,240
and walk together.

1751
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,760
You know how hard it is to be an elder brother.

1752
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,640
I'm at the final stage.

1753
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,000
I have a lot to say.

1754
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,640
and I'm afraid to break it.

1755
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,920
I thought I was a person with high tears.

1756
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,240
I'm just strong on the outside.

1757
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,160
I love everyone.

1758
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,640
and I don't want to leave you.

1759
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,240
I'm afraid I can't see the picture when I get up.

1760
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,280
The loneliness of eating alone at home.

1761
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:49,960
Sometimes I feel

1762
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,840
it's not impossible

1763
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,080
It's not impossible.

1764
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,440
For this encounter

1765
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,680
I can only describe myself

1766
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,720
I can understand myself better.

1767
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,480
and my sister.

1768
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,240
We're going to be apart.

1769
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,400
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

1770
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,880
Why are you here?

1771
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,560
Hello, I'm the financial man of Lu's Mouth.

1772
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,760
Long time no see.

1773
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,160
How have you been?

1774
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,040
I'm doing well.

1775
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,560
Why are you so sad?

1776
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,680
Why did you get rejected?

1777
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,760
Why don't you read my Diaries first?

1778
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,400
How have you been?

1779
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,240
You caught a cold when you came.

1780
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,640
I'm fine.

1781
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,560
It's done later.

1782
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,480
Did you meet any buddies that you get along with?

1783
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,080
Which one does Xiaoling flower like the most?

1784
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,120
What about her?

1785
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,440
There's nothing between you two.

1786
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,560
I think these are all worth learning.

1787
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,600
So what did you learn

1788
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,360
from them?

1789
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,720
I don't think

1790
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,600
are not as good

1791
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,960
to express their love to each other.

1792
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,440
You can't be too cheesy usually.

1793
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,480
Normally,

1794
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,080
I think it's good.

1795
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,360
Everyone has their own way.

1796
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,200
Will they cry again, Yuan Bo?

1797
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,880
You're ridiculous.

1798
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,800
I didn't cry.

1799
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,840
I'm a water constellation. I didn't cry.

1800
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,720
What's wrong with you?

1801
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,280
I don't know.

1802
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,280
I didn't bring tissues.

1803
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,920
I cried when talking about other siblings in the house.

1804
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,480
Because I feel my sister

1805
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,640
jealous of the way other brothers get along.

1806
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,320
Maybe she wants to express her love for me.

1807
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,680
she still wants to care about me.

1808
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,360
But she's stubborn.

1809
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,800
I couldn't say it.

1810
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,480
I felt so bad for her.

1811
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:50,480
(Diaries for Siblings)

1812
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,840
To the soup.

1813
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,800
Coming, To Su Zihao.

1814
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,720
I have news.

1815
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,560
To Yuan Bo

1816
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,200
To He Wenjie.

1817
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,760
Your confession time has begun.

1818
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,360
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

1819
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,480
and run towards her.

1820
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,000
I know you will succeed.

1821
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,840
Okay.

1822
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,360
Let's go.

1823
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,720
Come on.

1824
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,720
Okay, wait for me.

1825
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,160
Come on.

1826
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,520
Come on.

1827
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,440
Fatty.

1828
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,520
Will you support me

1829
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,600
will you support me?

1830
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,520
So you're going to confess your love.

1831
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,320
What do you think?

1832
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,280
I came here

1833
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,600
do you think I should finish this?

1834
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,080
or draw a better stop?

1835
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,840
I'm fine with anything.

1836
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,640
Because I think

1837
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,920
is also an end for yourself.

1838
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,520
Have you decided what to say?

1839
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,680
Don't break your tongue later.

1840
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,160
I've made up my mind.

1841
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:06,760
No.

1842
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,240
Sit there and don't shake.

1843
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,840
Let's say

1844
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,920
lose decently.

1845
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,040
I won't lose.

1846
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,680
I'll win.

1847
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,880
Really?

1848
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,600
Yes.

1849
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,960
Congratulations, Wen Jie.

1850
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,600
Your confession time has begun.

1851
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,160
Please choose the girl you like

1852
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,640
and run towards her.

1853
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,000
Have you decided where to go?

1854
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,640
I have.

1855
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,440
Go!

1856
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,240
I'm going.

1857
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,280
Come on.

1858
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,920
Fatty.

1859
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,000
Wait for me.

1860
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,240
Bye.

1861
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,760
If you're not sure,

1862
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,880
you would confess to a girl.

1863
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,680
Come here.

1864
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,800
Not in the past

1865
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,120
I came here.

1866
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,960
You'll definitely confess to a girl.

1867
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,400
Not here.

1868
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,240
I think

1869
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,080
I don't want to have regrets in my life.

1870
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,200
Hello.

1871
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,960
You're here.

1872
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,479
To Yuan Bo,

1873
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:45,000
It's time for you to confess.

1874
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,640
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

1875
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,680
and run towards her.

1876
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,680
So you're going to confess now?

1877
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,319
Yes, I'm going to confess now.

1878
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,200
I'm leaving.

1879
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,160
Good luck.

1880
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,960
I hope you succeed.

1881
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,080
Okay.

1882
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,960
Go ahead. Bye.

1883
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,160
I thought a lot last night.

1884
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:09,720
I want to say

1885
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,880
I still want to confess to Hua.

1886
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,000
Go with Hua.

1887
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,399
to express my thoughts.

1888
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,840
and express

1889
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,160
my feelings.

1890
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,840
Hello.

1891
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,279
You're here.

1892
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:28,760
Come on.

1893
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,920
How can you give way to me?

1894
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,359
Here you are. Please.

1895
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,680
Here are your flowers.

1896
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,399
Thank you.

1897
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:43,680
You prepared so well.

1898
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,760
So handsome today.

1899
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,560
Are you surprised that I came?

1900
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,840
It's expected.

1901
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,200
This is a gift for you.

1902
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,960
You didn't even ask what I bought for you.

1903
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,040
Do I want to see it?

1904
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,480
No.

1905
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,720
I bought you the incense.

1906
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,520
You know?

1907
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:07,840
Yes.

1908
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,720
And...

1909
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,160
Why are you so nervous?

1910
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,000
Today I feel

1911
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,800
I'm a little nervous and anxious.

1912
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,200
Don't be nervous. Come on.

1913
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:26,880
Don't talk.

1914
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,920
You're a stranger.

1915
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,200
You're transparent.

1916
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,040
I'm nervous.

1917
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,040
I thought about a lot of things.

1918
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,000
I wanted to tell her.

1919
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,560
But the moment I saw her,

1920
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,000
my mind went blank.

1921
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,120
I really don't know what to say.

1922
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,120
I wrote you a letter. Do you want to read it?

1923
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,760
Really?

1924
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,360
Of course.

1925
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,560
You slept last night.

1926
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,760
I'll write it there.

1927
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:52,640
Really?

1928
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,840
I wrote it until 5 a.m.

1929
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,960
This morning I found

1930
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,680
I need to add something.

1931
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,800
I added a lot

1932
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,520
in the memo.

1933
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,080
It was written in the car on the way here.

1934
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,960
So many.

1935
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,320
It's been a long time since you received a handwritten letter.

1936
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,600
To make up for last time's regret.

1937
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,520
Again?

1938
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,000
Nervous and urgency.

1939
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,040
I'm a little nervous now.

1940
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,680
I'm actually a little...

1941
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,640
Today is a special day.

1942
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,960
Right?

1943
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,520
Which line is smiling?

1944
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,440
Take a guess.

1945
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,520
He said you were arrogant.

1946
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,480
You said you took ugly photos of me.

1947
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,200
I was really excited.

1948
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,360
I think Hua has received

1949
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,800
my thoughts.

1950
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,520
Very tacit.

1951
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,080
I think our relationship

1952
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,000
is getting better.

1953
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,320
I'm walking towards love.

1954
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,240
I think I'll cry

1955
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:24,880
I'm going to cry too.

1956
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,600
What should I do?

1957
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,240
You'd better

1958
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,560
I suddenly want to say three words.

1959
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,800
Guess what three words?

1960
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,720
When reading the letter,

1961
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,080
Tae-seo was very touched.

1962
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,360
I'm choking.

1963
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:48,920
I think my sister

1964
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,560
is also very touched.

1965
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,640
and happy.

1966
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,360
I hope Tae-seo can protect you.

1967
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,720
Why are you crying?

1968
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,640
I don't know.

1969
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,160
It's okay.

1970
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,720
I'll go to Changsha to find her later.

1971
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,720
Beautiful flowers.

1972
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,600
Are you touched?

1973
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,640
They're crying.

1974
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,440
I'm not crying.

1975
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,000
Really.

1976
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,720
I cried right away.

1977
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,560
What's the score after reading this letter?

1978
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,480
Almost nine points.

1979
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,680
You can get nine points now.

1980
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,440
Really?

1981
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,520
Nine points.

1982
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,960
He gave me 78 points before.

1983
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,880
I was still unhappy.

1984
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,400
Indeed.

1985
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,440
Maybe my impression

1986
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,000
is...

1987
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,280
Yes.

1988
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,920
Normally, I might be

1989
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,600
I might...

1990
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,480
I can't speak.

1991
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,040
Please organize it.

1992
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,360
I may need 200 or 300.

1993
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,880
So I'm 90 now.

1994
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,320
You need to reach 200 or 300.

1995
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,800
No, 90 to 100.

1996
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:54,920
Okay.

1997
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,600
I brought you a gift too.

1998
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,520
Really?

1999
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,160
Did you take my ugly photo last time?

2000
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:05,960
right?

2001
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,440
When we were in the room,

2002
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:07,960
in the room.

2003
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,000
How did you lock your hand?

2004
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,120
Am I like this?

2005
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,240
Lock it like this.

2006
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,160
Don't move.

2007
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:14,480
Don't move.

2008
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,720
Let me show you my gift.

2009
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,120
Open this hand.

2010
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,680
I know what you're going to do.

2011
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,680
Hurry up?

2012
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,560
I don't think I can do this.

2013
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,440
My hands are a little big.

2014
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,680
Let go.

2015
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,200
Let go.

2016
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,640
You said you like crystals.

2017
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,200
On the first day you came, you told me

2018
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,520
I wanted to open a crystal shop.

2019
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,600
What kind of crystal is it?

2020
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,840
I bought yellow crystal a while ago.

2021
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,280
Guess

2022
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,040
why I gave you this colour flower.

2023
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,080
Blue.

2024
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,600
Does it have any meaning?

2025
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,400
Let me give you a hint.

2026
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:00,840
Okay.

2027
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,440
Our previous date.

2028
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,600
Blue.

2029
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,160
Let me think.

2030
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
I know blue.

2031
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,200
The flower we made together

2032
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,480
right?

2033
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,120
You stick it here and I stick it here.

2034
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,040
Okay.

2035
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:16,880
Great.

2036
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,520
OK?

2037
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,040
So it's that one.

2038
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:20,480
Yes.

2039
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,160
The craftsmanship is blue and white.

2040
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,320
It's pretty

2041
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,120
I don't know

2042
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,360
I don't know what flavor you like.

2043
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,120
I bought a lot anyway.

2044
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,160
I bought every flavor.

2045
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,920
I hope some people

2046
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,840
think of me when you order.

2047
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,000
Do I look good?

2048
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,520
Yes

2049
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,240
When I told Wang Jiyu in the car,

2050
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,400
I said I bought a crystal for Bobo.

2051
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:47,840
He said

2052
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,920
Where is it?

2053
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,600
I said I have it.

2054
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,440
He said, "How do you give it to him?"

2055
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,920
I said I was going to do this later.

2056
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,920
Then he said,

2057
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,680
"You're so greasy."

2058
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,480
He said

2059
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,880
How could he say that about your sister?

2060
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,000
You don't understand.

2061
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,200
I don't understand

2062
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,720
I don't understand.

2063
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,640
That's too much.

2064
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,520
Do you know what I thought

2065
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,080
What are you doing?

2066
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,760
What are you doing? I'm putting a ring on you.

2067
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,280
Right?

2068
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,600
In your dreams.

2069
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,280
Wear a ring.

2070
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,360
My hands are empty.

2071
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,800
I'm a little disappointed.

2072
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,400
No.

2073
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,720
Which one do you want to wear?

2074
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,680
No.

2075
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,000
He was a little disappointed.

2076
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,880
No.

2077
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,120
My hands are a little empty.

2078
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,440
No.

2079
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,040
Since Tianjin,

2080
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,000
I thought...

2081
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,320
What?

2082
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,600
I think Bobo is good.

2083
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,720
Right?

2084
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,040
I think each date

2085
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,000
each date.

2086
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,680
Because I thought a lot before.

2087
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,240
I thought

2088
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,720
if you really want to know me

2089
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,480
or you're just playing hard to get.

2090
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,760
Maybe

2091
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,080
after Tianjin.

2092
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,960
I'll open my heart to you.

2093
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,480
Didn't you notice

2094
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,200
I used to talk to you

2095
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,560
when I talked to you.

2096
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,120
Well...

2097
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,800
Hello, Terri.

2098
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,880
Now I'm Bobo.

2099
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,440
So do you prefer to call you Terri

2100
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,480
or Bo?

2101
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:12,800
The latter.

2102
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,280
Okay.

2103
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,040
But in fact,

2104
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,000
are mutual.

2105
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,640
I think it's the same for me later.

2106
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,440
Yes.

2107
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:18,880
Right?

2108
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,800
You're getting more and more impolite.

2109
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,120
Yeah.

2110
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,120
Good.

2111
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,040
I don't like this either.

2112
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,920
I think we should show the real you.

2113
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,120
I just said in the letter that

2114
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,280
more people will like it.

2115
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,920
Why do you want more people to like you?

2116
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,760
We don't include the opposite sex.

2117
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,440
What are you thinking?

2118
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:37,960
Okay.

2119
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,280
I want to.

2120
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,640
Do you have anything else to say to Hua?

2121
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,400
It's been a long time since today.

2122
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,840
since today.

2123
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:58,880
Are you done?

2124
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,320
You can leave now.

2125
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,320
Where should I go?

2126
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,560
I'll give you one last minute.

2127
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,640
to express your feelings.

2128
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,240
He doesn't want to express.

2129
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,880
Maybe.

2130
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,400
What I want to say the most

2131
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,480
is that

2132
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,680
the life in the small house is over,

2133
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,040
I think

2134
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,560
just started.

2135
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,400
What do you think?

2136
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,440
I...

2137
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,240
in the letter.

2138
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,040
I think we are quite in sync.

2139
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
I think so too.

2140
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,600
your observation period

2141
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,800
to be responsible for your relationship.

2142
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,720
When are you coming to Changsha?

2143
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,920
Anytime.

2144
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,320
Okay.

2145
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:46,960
Just leave.

2146
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:47,520
Really.

2147
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:48,800
No.

2148
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,480
Let's celebrate the New Year.

2149
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,600
Anytime after New Year.

2150
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,240
Okay.

2151
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,560
We may meet soon after Chinese New Year.

2152
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,280
Maybe I'm coming to Shanghai.

2153
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,360
I'll pick you up at the airport.

2154
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,320
Okay.

2155
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,480
After you come to Changsha,

2156
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,480
let's go to Shanghai.

2157
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,600
Sure.

2158
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,960
I thought your sister would come today.

2159
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,720
She's here

2160
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Coming

2161
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,440
Really?

2162
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,840
I'm at a place ahead.

2163
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,800
Wait over there.

2164
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,360
Did you cry?

2165
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,720
I thought you were coming.

2166
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,800
You were waiting for me to confess.

2167
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,160
No.

2168
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,320
Don't you want to see my sister?

2169
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,320
We can meet.

2170
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,240
and see how good I am.

2171
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
Put the letter away.

2172
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,920
Give me a hug.

2173
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,440
Can I hug you?

2174
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,120
I'm generous.

2175
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,720
I want to stand up and hug.

2176
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,920
I'll keep in touch with Hua.

2177
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,480
When the time is ripe,

2178
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,840
I'll be with her.

2179
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,560
I hope I can get closer to her.

2180
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,480
Today's confession is

2181
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,800
Follow your heart.

2182
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,480
I think it's good.

2183
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,160
He's very responsible for love.

2184
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,120
After I met Tae-seo,

2185
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,600
I found that

2186
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,320
he is

2187
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
a considerate man.

2188
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,200
He really cares about my sister.

2189
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,400
So I support him.

2190
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,000
My sister is with Tae-seo.

2191
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,400
Hello, I'm Tae-seo.

2192
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,160
Hwa.

2193
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:42,960
Let's do it.

2194
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:43,680
Sure.

2195
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,040
Thank you.

2196
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:45,880
Don't slip.

2197
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,400
Okay.

2198
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,200
Which boy are you most interested in?

2199
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,080
She smiles a lot when taking photos.

2200
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,680
She looks really cute

2201
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,160
She's really cute.

2202
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,320
I had a great time with Tae-seo.

2203
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,680
This is what I want.

2204
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,480
Yinbo, I’m grateful to you all my life.

2205
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,800
You’re always there.

2206
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,960
The fireworks that someone created for me

2207
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,280
is small,

2208
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,240
the light at that moment

2209
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,120
emitted to me.

2210
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,600
It belongs to me.

2211
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,960
I already like it.

2212
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,240
Will he observe for that long?

2213
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,880
Yes, I will.

2214
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,440
To the soup.

2215
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,000
(It's time for you to confess.)

2216
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,560
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

2217
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,480
and run towards her.

2218
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,720
A Su Ziyi is waiting for happiness.

2219
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,480
OK.

2220
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,760
You don't have to read the rest.

2221
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,160
Go ahead.

2222
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:46,920
Go.

2223
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,120
Okay.

2224
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,280
I believe he will succeed.

2225
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,920
I like this girl very much.

2226
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,600
I just want to fight for her.

2227
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,320
regardless of the consequences.

2228
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,640
I just want to see her now.

2229
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,200
I've learned how to express love.

2230
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,640
Hello.

2231
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,240
What? An interviewer?

2232
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,160
Sit here.

2233
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,280
So formal.

2234
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,600
Handsome?

2235
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,160
Not bad.

2236
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,680
Better than Su Zihao.

2237
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:24,800
OK.

2238
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,680
I've prepared a few things for you.

2239
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,720
Let's start with the first one.

2240
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,240
Okay.

2241
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,400
Well,

2242
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,400
is a video.

2243
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,240
Put it here.

2244
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,160
OK?

2245
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:36,760
Sure.

2246
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:37,600
Okay.

2247
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,040
You're so nervous.

2248
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:40,840
Don't be nervous.

2249
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,440
Don't talk.

2250
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,680
I won't talk. I'll shut up.

2251
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,120
This is the right face.

2252
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,640
Where did you get the video?

2253
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,240
What?

2254
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,520
I have a lot of help.

2255
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,560
The video was quite touching.

2256
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,640
Because many of them are his

2257
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,480
recorded my photos and videos.

2258
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,280
I feel sincerity and sincerity.

2259
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,280
Come on. I'm looking forward to it.

2260
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,920
You're looking forward to it.

2261
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,320
I'll look for it.

2262
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,120
I'm looking forward to it.

2263
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,160
Don't be nervous.

2264
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,160
This one.

2265
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,160
You do it.

2266
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:28,760
Okay.

2267
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,480
So you weren't upstairs yesterday.

2268
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,560
Are you doing this?

2269
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,360
I don't know.

2270
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,600
It was snowing that day.

2271
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,880
Actually, I went to get the camera.

2272
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,400
but I don't usually take pictures of others.

2273
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,280
Because I don't know

2274
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,440
if others were willing to be photographed.

2275
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,160
I didn't care.

2276
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,080
I went to take photos of you.

2277
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,280
But I took it from you.

2278
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,320
We didn't take a photo together.

2279
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,440
But I think the scene is similar.

2280
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,720
I think it's a group photo.

2281
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,960
Xiao Ling was helping me yesterday.

2282
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,320
She drew it.

2283
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,800
A kitten.

2284
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,080
Xiao Ling is good at drawing.

2285
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,880
And you sent me this.

2286
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,320
I hope I can become

2287
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,040
I can become

2288
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:16,760
a stone.

2289
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,960
Stupid stone.

2290
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,120
Luckily, I made a breakthrough.

2291
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:21,880
I took the initiative to communicate with you.

2292
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,920
You're willing to communicate too?

2293
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,920
I had a successful experience.

2294
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,680
I think it'll be easier to get along in the future.

2295
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,440
Actually, this is what you sent me.

2296
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,640
Happiness is like a overflowing soup bun.

2297
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,480
I think it looks like you.

2298
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,000
You sent me

2299
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,920
We sat on the rocks to watch the sea.

2300
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,000
Then I searched.

2301
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,760
we might fall in love with each other.

2302
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,680
Did you search it yourself?

2303
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,880
or did I explain it to you?

2304
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:49,680
I searched

2305
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,760
and gave you

2306
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,480
to show you your knowledge.

2307
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,680
That's how I feel.

2308
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,000
You held my hand by the sea.

2309
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,080
You've been in my world since then.

2310
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,320
You gave me the scarf on the bus.

2311
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,160
I'm happy to be cared about.

2312
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,080
I know.

2313
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,000
I also exist in your world.

2314
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,920
After the first night of Tientsin,

2315
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,720
I appeared in your album.

2316
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,800
You always take pictures of me.

2317
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,080
There's a harbor

2318
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,000
a harbor where you can stop whenever you're tired.

2319
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,920
The last one is...

2320
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,600
Hello, Susu.

2321
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,200
Let me introduce myself again.

2322
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:53,880
I'm Soup.

2323
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,520
Welcome to my world.

2324
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,560
We'll record the next story together.

2325
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,360
Nice.

2326
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,160
Do you want to write it down?

2327
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,520
Okay, give me this.

2328
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,400
That hand ledger.

2329
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,360
is a very thoughtful gift.

2330
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,560
Hand ledger.

2331
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,280
I want to express

2332
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,840
from the first day,

2333
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,680
my eyes were full of her.

2334
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,000
I always care about her.

2335
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,360
And yesterday,

2336
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,120
I made yesterday.

2337
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,000
Actually, I'm not good at it.

2338
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,120
I made two earstuds for you.

2339
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,960
This is May.

2340
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,920
Oh-wol looks like this too.

2341
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,400
Really?

2342
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,400
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

2343
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,960
Then I told the shop

2344
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,080
girls like German very much.

2345
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,760
And she also has a German.

2346
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,840
I might have done a general shape.

2347
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,200
And the sculpture was helped by the owner.

2348
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,720
That's it

2349
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,600
It's fluid.

2350
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,880
Then I turned off the fire.

2351
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,000
Almost.

2352
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,200
The first German is ready.

2353
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,000
I thought you might like it.

2354
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,840
Thank you.

2355
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,880
Oh-wol, come and take a look.

2356
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:15,920
May.

2357
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:16,840
Where?

2358
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,320
It's similar.

2359
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:18,880
Kind of.

2360
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,280
a pair of German cats.

2361
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,200
I hope I can be with her.

2362
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,200
The things I give

2363
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,480
may be something with time factors.

2364
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,200
Hope we can rely on each other.

2365
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,390
Come with me to get something.

2366
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,830
You want something?

2367
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:41,360
Yes.

2368
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,750
This

2369
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,230
Take this over

2370
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:48,830
Bring it here.

2371
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:50,880
Is there a cat inside?

2372
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,360
Yes.

2373
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,440
I'll give you a kitten.

2374
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,400
Okay, I believe it.

2375
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,030
Each represents a story.

2376
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,880
Please guess

2377
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,080
This one.

2378
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,150
Fried eggs.

2379
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,520
That's not fried egg.

2380
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,830
You should

2381
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:10,480
your thoughts carefully.

2382
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,320
Sandwich.

2383
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:12,800
Yes.

2384
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,430
Yes.

2385
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:16,120
The sandwich I made for you that morning.

2386
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:16,510
Yes.

2387
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:17,840
The sandwich incident.

2388
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,870
The cause, the process, and the result.

2389
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,830
Okay.

2390
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,360
I went down to look for it.

2391
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,320
Where's my sandwich?

2392
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,480
I ate your sandwich.

2393
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,440
I'm hungry too.

2394
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,280
I'll try it when I get back.

2395
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:29,840
Okay.

2396
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,200
It's because

2397
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,800
you think I'm happy

2398
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,510
because of you?

2399
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,040
Yes.

2400
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,110
This should be

2401
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,600
the first time I took you on a date.

2402
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:43,960
Yes.

2403
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,400
I was quite happy that day.

2404
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,070
Because

2405
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:56,920
if you're not interested in ping-pong,

2406
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,560
what you did that day

2407
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,510
you respect my interest.

2408
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,480
and you're willing to

2409
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,840
And

2410
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,240
this bouquet

2411
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,790
The one I gave you?

2412
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:14,520
Yes.

2413
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,560
What is this?

2414
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,480
These are for you.

2415
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,310
I think a date should be more formal.

2416
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,280
But it's not white.

2417
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,630
It only has red.

2418
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,070
But it's similar.

2419
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,320
Red roses.

2420
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:28,830
Yes.

2421
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:29,790
All roses.

2422
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,000
And

2423
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:35,070
These two.

2424
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:37,080
These two are

2425
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,920
One encore piggy for each.

2426
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,000
I don't know if you're carrying a backpack.

2427
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,080
So...

2428
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,040
Okay, carry it.

2429
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,870
Hang it on the bag.

2430
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:51,960
And...

2431
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,840
Susu, can you stand up?

2432
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:01,360
What are you doing?

2433
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,320
Nothing.

2434
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,070
Panic.

2435
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,560
I...

2436
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:09,600
Think about it.

2437
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,480
Say something.

2438
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,510
Don't be nervous.

2439
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:23,000
I think we met a lot of difficulties.

2440
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,760
and uncertainty.

2441
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,880
But I learned to take the initiative in the cabin.

2442
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,680
I learned to express love.

2443
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,400
Every time you feel I get close to you,

2444
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,070
you'll give positive response.

2445
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,640
Thank you for caring about my feelings.

2446
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,560
Susu.

2447
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,080
I want to be with you.

2448
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,560
I want to be with you.

2449
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,160
Will you be my girlfriend?

2450
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,800
Thank you.

2451
01:32:59,520 --> 01:32:59,960
Will you?

2452
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,880
Yes.

2453
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:16,080
But I still have something for you.

2454
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,680
It's okay. Give me a hug. I haven't hugged you yet.

2455
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,630
Look at this side.

2456
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,320
Side.

2457
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:40,120
There's a letter.

2458
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,280
The soup asked me

2459
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,360
if I'll receive your handwritten letter again.

2460
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,360
When will you write me another letter?

2461
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,400
I've never written to anyone.

2462
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,120
It's an honor.

2463
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,270
I think on the last day,

2464
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,160
I should prepare a handwritten letter

2465
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,600
to meet his expectations.

2466
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,390
and express my feelings.

2467
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,430
Hello.

2468
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,120
A Tom Cat who is teased by fate.

2469
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,840
You mentioned

2470
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,240
if I would write to you again.

2471
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,120
That's it.

2472
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,200
I've been planning for a long time.

2473
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,200
This letter...

2474
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,840
I'm embarrassed.

2475
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,910
This letter should be reserved and mean.

2476
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:29,760
or passionate, bold, straightforward and simple?

2477
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,070
I often wonder

2478
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:32,990
when I started liking you.

2479
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,480
I have many answers.

2480
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,390
So cheesy.

2481
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:38,320
But I think

2482
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,510
not real enough.

2483
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,430
You're cold.

2484
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,200
I'm nervous.

2485
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,670
Don't be nervous.

2486
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:46,520
Maybe the moment you opened the door for me,

2487
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,040
I think

2488
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:49,120
he is so handsome.

2489
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,710
Maybe it's the first time

2490
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:52,990
on our way back from shopping,

2491
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,390
I shared my earphones with you for the first time.

2492
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,240
Let's listen to music together.

2493
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,390
Maybe when we were looking through the life album,

2494
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,600
there are too many shining points.

2495
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,560
For example, ping pong players

2496
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,920
or students from Tsinghua.

2497
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,880
I have no choice but to admire Qiang.

2498
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,600
Why are you praising me?

2499
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:08,920
Praise you?

2500
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,270
Yes, very good.

2501
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,360
Great.

2502
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,990
Maybe you've been choosing me every day.

2503
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,560
and sent me a message about your feelings.

2504
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,640
I sent it to Susu.

2505
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,720
a little sensitive after the sandwich.

2506
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,840
It's soup.

2507
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,150
I'll send it to her today.

2508
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,360
The soup was sent to me today

2509
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,920
Did you send it to me today?

2510
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,240
I sent it to Susu.

2511
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,080
I think it's good to take it slow.

2512
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,320
I got a text from the soup.

2513
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,280
I sent a lot.

2514
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,080
The stage costume is amazing.

2515
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,590
Give her a good response.

2516
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:36,960
Try again and send it to Susu.

2517
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,040
I feel Susu's love.

2518
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,200
I'm happy to receive the text from the soup.

2519
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:48,440
That feeling makes me feel at ease.

2520
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,270
Maybe from the first time

2521
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,680
our first date,

2522
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,630
I saw a lot of clothes.

2523
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,000
and took the initiative to carry my bag.

2524
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,320
A little girl who cares about details.

2525
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,560
You don't have to read the bracket.

2526
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,030
Maybe on the night of siblings.

2527
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,840
Look into my eyes

2528
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,240
and sang "I Want to Say".

2529
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,390
Maybe in Tianjin,

2530
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,760
in Tianjin.

2531
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,840
Maybe when we were watching crosstalk,

2532
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,520
When I didn't know,

2533
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,670
when I didn't know.

2534
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,120
He expressed his love to me openly.

2535
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,760
The book says

2536
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,280
Good meetings are about lighting up each other.

2537
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,040
So I was thinking

2538
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,200
what it means to light up each other.

2539
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,800
Actually, I've been thinking

2540
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,430
I've been thinking

2541
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,510
why I need

2542
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:33,520
someone's firm towards me

2543
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,160
and take the initiative.

2544
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,190
It's because you're scared.

2545
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,160
I'm afraid my expectations will fail.

2546
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,160
I'm afraid the people and things I cherish

2547
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,310
will die without any disease.

2548
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,160
So the beginning

2549
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,440
So cautious and cautious.

2550
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,160
and confused.

2551
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,470
They have no answer.

2552
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,200
Or

2553
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,160
we need to find the answer together.

2554
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,270
The moon is beautiful tonight.

2555
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,710
It's taking time

2556
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,600
Su Ziyi.

2557
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,160
Okay.

2558
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,800
The night is beautiful.

2559
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,040
Yes.

2560
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:06,590
I like you.

2561
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,600
I finally understand.

2562
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,150
You understood me once.

2563
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,480
I understand it every time.

2564
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,710
Then pretend you don't understand.

2565
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,520
Mr Su, tell me.

2566
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,880
Well...

2567
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,080
I'm sorry.

2568
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:22,680
Well...

2569
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,800
I like you.

2570
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:24,920
Me too.

2571
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,800
Put it away.

2572
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
Keep it.

2573
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,470
(The third handwritten letter)

2574
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,240
The third handwritten letter.

2575
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,720
The first time is for Su Zihao.

2576
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,080
I said,

2577
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:43,280
I said there's another danger.

2578
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,270
A sincere confession.

2579
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,960
I feel very happy.

2580
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,920
It's very touching.

2581
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:51,360
Harry.

2582
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,350
Take a photo for me.

2583
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,480
Two.

2584
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,360
Are you going to throw me over the shoulder?

2585
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:16,960
Do you think

2586
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:18,800
someone will come later?

2587
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,600
Don't ask that.

2588
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,240
I have a strange feeling.

2589
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,160
He's coming.

2590
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,200
Xin.

2591
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,670
Xin.

2592
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,120
Fatty.

2593
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:58,480
What is this?

2594
01:38:59,320 --> 01:38:59,640
What is this?

2595
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,640
This is your gift.

2596
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,360
What is this?

2597
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,670
You're so scary.

2598
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:08,030
You're so mean, aren't you?

2599
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:10,880
Didn't you confess your love?

2600
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,960
Didn't you go to confess?

2601
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,680
You're "poisonous", aren't you?

2602
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:24,350
What is it?

2603
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,360
Okay, don't cry.

2604
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,600
Stop making me cry.

2605
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,710
I didn't choose ABCD.

2606
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:40,960
Why?

2607
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,600
Why don't you try it?

2608
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:47,920
Because I think

2609
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:50,910
you can't lose

2610
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,240
you can't lose either.

2611
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,360
You can't lose either.

2612
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,120
I really thought you went to confess your love.

2613
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,680
I've thought about how to comfort you tonight.

2614
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,720
Because you will fail.

2615
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:18,750
No.

2616
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,920
I won't let you comfort me.

2617
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:22,720
As we have zero votes,

2618
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,560
I think my sister can also

2619
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,280
a ritual.

2620
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,240
I can't tell you how I feel.

2621
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,360
But I think

2622
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,480
she can receive

2623
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,630
from her brother.

2624
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,720
Is this Porky?

2625
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,750
Is it Bo Niu?

2626
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:39,200
Yes.

2627
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,110
And this is the same style

2628
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:43,040
the same style.

2629
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:43,520
Yeah.

2630
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,400
It's so cute.

2631
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,510
This is my first gift.

2632
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,040
What else?

2633
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,880
And this.

2634
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,560
Camera.

2635
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,150
Really?

2636
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:58,160
You gave it to me?

2637
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,880
Girls should record themselves more.

2638
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,240
You're crying.

2639
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,120
I prepared

2640
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,760
something touching.

2641
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,840
I dare not say it.

2642
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:07,840
Tell me.

2643
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,240
I choked here.

2644
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,360
Tell me.

2645
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:11,840
Do you have another letter?

2646
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,830
No.

2647
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:13,630
But...

2648
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,390
Eight characters.

2649
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,470
Read it.

2650
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:19,280
I think these words are well written.

2651
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,000
This is for you.

2652
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,550
The journey is flourishing and elegant.

2653
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:26,520
Be content, ambitious, gentle and firm.

2654
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,680
Is it for me?

2655
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,320
It's a long journey.

2656
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,680
I'm not elegant either.

2657
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,800
You know what?

2658
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,200
When I heard

2659
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,520
when I heard the word "xin",

2660
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,830
So scary.

2661
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:44,280
Fatty

2662
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:46,400
Fatty.

2663
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,520
Xin.

2664
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:48,880
Xin.

2665
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,080
Fatty.

2666
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,830
Actually, I thought about this last night.

2667
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:05,440
Well,

2668
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:10,720
I think

2669
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,190
closing yourself.

2670
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:13,200
I think you can

2671
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,760
try more new people.

2672
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,040
And I'll be with you.

2673
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,160
First of all,

2674
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,200
you should open yourself a little bit.

2675
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,160
Be it friends, besties,

2676
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,920
and your love partner,

2677
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,310
No matter what choice you make,

2678
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:30,400
no matter what choice you make.

2679
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:34,200
The thing I fear the most is

2680
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,000
is when I'm with you.

2681
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,670
When I face the girl you like,

2682
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:38,000
or the girl who likes you,

2683
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,280
I can't

2684
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,110
I can't be very open

2685
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,600
to get along with her.

2686
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,760
So I think

2687
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,520
the relationship between siblings

2688
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,080
can't

2689
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,430
Words are hard to express.

2690
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:52,670
Blood is thicker than water.

2691
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:53,360
very...

2692
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,640
Like I told you today,

2693
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,560
I used to think

2694
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,960
I don't think we can get along.

2695
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,520
I can see that

2696
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,800
I think

2697
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,670
we can get along with each other.

2698
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:05,790
You can slowly find

2699
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,000
their shining points.

2700
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,080
I think

2701
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,270
a pair of eyes like this.

2702
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:10,560
Yes.

2703
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,080
We're both in a hurry when something happens.

2704
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,600
Let's calm down.

2705
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,200
Let's observe more when we're in trouble.

2706
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,440
I think we can slow down.

2707
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,440
especially to you.

2708
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,880
Then you will meet someone

2709
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:21,760
who suits you better.

2710
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,270
I think

2711
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:23,760
I will also

2712
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,790
as an observer.

2713
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:27,120
I won't...

2714
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,080
I won't do it

2715
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,200
I won't do

2716
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,880
to disturb you too much.

2717
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,470
There are more than four boys in life.

2718
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,040
You will have a better one.

2719
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:35,600
I think

2720
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,080
But if I don't get married,

2721
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:37,950
will you scold me?

2722
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:38,750
It's okay.

2723
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,880
We have zero votes. It doesn't matter.

2724
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,240
I found that

2725
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,240
I didn't know

2726
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,800
express myself with words.

2727
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,840
When facing a girl,

2728
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,680
facing a girl.

2729
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,000
I think too much.

2730
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,280
including my sister.

2731
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,240
Recently, when my sister is with me,

2732
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,720
I feel she's much better.

2733
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,760
She talked to me calmly.

2734
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,680
When we had dinner that day,

2735
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,760
She said we got along well like this.

2736
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,480
She wants me to communicate more.

2737
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,350
We didn't communicate before.

2738
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:06,720
His state today

2739
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,120
beyond my imagination.

2740
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,360
My relationship with Fatty

2741
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,440
more mature

2742
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,400
and care about each other.

2743
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,400
That's good.

2744
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,040
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

2745
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,560
I have news.

2746
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,160
(It's time for you to confess.)

2747
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,720
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

2748
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,870
and run towards her.

2749
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,440
My heart is racing.

2750
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,680
Will anyone come?

2751
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:02,080
Zhang Yixing: You can do it. Zhang Yixing: You can do it.

2752
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,280
can stop me

2753
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,440
to express my true thoughts.

2754
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,320
Whether it's for Xiaoling

2755
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,800
or for yourself,

2756
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:09,880
It makes me feel

2757
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,280
I won't regret for the past 20 days.

2758
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,720
The sun is waiting

2759
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:17,560
Pick B.

2760
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:20,880
Go ahead.

2761
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,680
Come on.

2762
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,510
Let me take a break.

2763
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,680
to calm down.

2764
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,400
Come on. Come on.

2765
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,160
Come on.

2766
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,760
Let me hear what you want to say.

2767
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,960
After so many days,

2768
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,920
after so many days.

2769
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,000
the two of us

2770
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,240
texted each other for the first time.

2771
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,760
We're destined

2772
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,600
(and we'll be together.)

2773
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:48,560
I sent a message.

2774
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,400
That night, I thought

2775
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,840
she would send it to me.

2776
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,520
Then I received your text that day.

2777
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,920
Tell me, can you teach me how to fight against the landlord?

2778
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,880
Although

2779
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,520
I haven't taught you how to play the Landlord,

2780
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,320
But I think

2781
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,750
from that moment on,

2782
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,320
from that moment on.

2783
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,760
Including that time when I cried and broke down,

2784
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,040
You're so good. You're good.

2785
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,680
When I sit alone in the room,

2786
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,920
you will knock carefully and come in.

2787
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:37,560
Can I come in?

2788
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,430
Yes.

2789
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,800
It's okay. Tell me if you want to.

2790
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,240
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

2791
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,640
How should I put it?

2792
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:45,720
Wait, let me take a break.

2793
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:48,830
I'm actually

2794
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:49,790
who doesn't like others

2795
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:51,320
who sees my fragile side.

2796
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,400
When you came in,

2797
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,400
I really want to express

2798
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,950
to you.

2799
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,280
You heard it

2800
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,160
and comforted me.

2801
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:00,830
I feel

2802
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:03,360
I think it's something else

2803
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,360
I'm very touched

2804
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,120
and trust.

2805
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,720
I think this is very rare.

2806
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:13,880
At first,

2807
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,000
my impression of you was

2808
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,150
she doesn't talk much.

2809
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:21,880
In the crowd,

2810
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,480
you may be

2811
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,040
to observe us.

2812
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,440
But after getting used to it,

2813
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,400
you will slowly communicate with them.

2814
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,070
and even make jokes with them.

2815
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,070
Add an egg.

2816
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:36,880
Eggs are more nutritious anyway.

2817
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,000
It can grow you to 180 cm.

2818
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,750
This is actually

2819
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,160
Come on. Come on. Come on.

2820
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:49,360
At the end,

2821
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,910
in many aspects.

2822
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:52,080
This is also

2823
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,480
a very strange feeling.

2824
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:57,470
I think my brothers like drawing.

2825
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,960
a clean boy.

2826
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:01,950
Choosing Xiao Ling

2827
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,550
They communicate a lot.

2828
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:04,510
And their emotional value

2829
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,320
seems to be full of each other.

2830
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:08,510
It's like this. It's like this.

2831
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:09,840
I think you look like an announcer.

2832
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,840
Actually, I cook

2833
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,030
Come on. Come on. Come on.

2834
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:12,560
Do the dishes

2835
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,520
Me too.

2836
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:17,720
What's his name?

2837
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,520
Harry.

2838
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,590
I actually like outdoor.

2839
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:23,520
I like skiing.

2840
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:24,600
I only know how to use double plates.

2841
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,320
Me too.

2842
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,760
I think when she is really happy,

2843
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,110
is eating.

2844
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:32,160
Whether it's food or fun

2845
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,120
I like them all.

2846
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,480
Which dish do you think is the best today?

2847
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,400
Does it count?

2848
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,720
No sweetness, no joy.

2849
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,320
No sweetness, no meat.

2850
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,080
I see.

2851
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:43,920
Map.

2852
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,800
Ling.

2853
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:00,880
We didn't

2854
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,400
cry because of ourselves.

2855
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,870
We always cry because of others.

2856
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:05,200
Why?

2857
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,560
Let's go eat. Let's go.

2858
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,190
Let's go.

2859
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,470
It's really hard to meet

2860
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:14,640
It's really hard.

2861
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,920
And it's actually the same frequency.

2862
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:17,790
It's kind of mysterious.

2863
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:19,320
It's like God thinks

2864
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,760
you two should get to know each other.

2865
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,920
Yes, you have to.

2866
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,560
So I'm really lucky

2867
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,720
Come on. Come on.

2868
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:32,190
Here.

2869
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,110
Guess what it is.

2870
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:35,680
Let me guess.

2871
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,360
It's a very popular thing recently.

2872
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:42,640
What is it?

2873
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,320
Come on.

2874
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:49,440
It's like this.

2875
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:50,910
Come on.

2876
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:51,390
But

2877
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:53,280
the same thing.

2878
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,840
It's the same thing.

2879
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,070
We have a tacit understanding again.

2880
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,920
Before I gave him the gift,

2881
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,640
what he would prepare for me.

2882
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,240
It's like this. It's like this.

2883
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,200
What did you buy?

2884
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,950
I didn't buy this.

2885
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:14,880
Let's go. Let's go.

2886
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:17,760
It means

2887
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,870
you can focus on your study

2888
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:21,120
and purify your magnetic field.

2889
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,680
It can make you

2890
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,960
you want me to become a career-type career woman.

2891
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,000
Because both of us

2892
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
are in different places.

2893
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,880
We are mainly

2894
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:29,880
our own study.

2895
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:31,230
Yes.

2896
01:51:31,230 --> 01:51:32,670
bring you more energy.

2897
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,590
Actually, I thought

2898
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:35,800
if I should buy a dark one.

2899
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,280
But I think

2900
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,430
the darker color would be more. Right.

2901
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,200
Yes.

2902
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,990
I thought about it when I bought it for you.

2903
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:43,480
what color do you usually have?

2904
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,480
Really?

2905
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,910
I wrote a letter. You read it first.

2906
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:47,390
Okay.

2907
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,800
Zhan Xinjia.

2908
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:53,360
Don't read it out.

2909
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,160
I'll feel awkward.

2910
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,200
Get to the point.

2911
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,870
Easy, happy.

2912
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,680
I remember the last sentence.

2913
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,200
Even if I skip class, I want to hang out with you.

2914
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,120
What makes me feel the most

2915
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,830
I can break it sometimes.

2916
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:34,200
Don't keep

2917
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,080
Because I thought about it.

2918
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,550
You were born in 2004.

2919
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:44,350
Are you a monkey?

2920
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:44,720
Yes.

2921
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,560
Right?

2922
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,720
And this rope and the red bead in the middle

2923
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,200
is related to the monkey.

2924
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,080
And it means protecting.

2925
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,000
And the two beside.

2926
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,150
This is a six-word proverb.

2927
01:52:57,150 --> 01:52:58,680
And this is also a six-word proverb.

2928
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,720
It means

2929
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,200
to keep you safe and healthy.

2930
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,160
I think you'll wear more

2931
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,670
in bright colors.

2932
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:06,360
So I think it's okay

2933
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,360
to buy you a bright color.

2934
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,880
Monkey's guardian rope.

2935
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,840
Are you touched?

2936
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,680
This part should be made up by me.

2937
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,560
Because it's ugly.

2938
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:24,640
Did you make it up yourself?

2939
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,950
What should I do?

2940
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:27,960
It's like this.

2941
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:28,560
Yes.

2942
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:29,560
Here.

2943
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:46,750
I do have a lot to tell you.

2944
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:48,670
but I don't know what to say.

2945
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,480
My brain is...

2946
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:56,320
I can't say it's messy.

2947
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,040
I just feel

2948
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,750
I got a lot of information.

2949
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:01,880
Thank you.

2950
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,720
Thank you even more.

2951
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,080
You've written it down.

2952
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,240
I'm really grateful.

2953
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:14,880
Okay.

2954
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,400
Anyway, we'll...

2955
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,430
We have to meet again.

2956
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,670
Will you come to see me?

2957
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:21,790
Of course.

2958
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,600
I'll bring the bracelet.

2959
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:26,480
Let's go. Let's go.

2960
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,630
I want to hug you

2961
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,440
on the last day.

2962
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,240
I'm very touched.

2963
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,830
Being together is something

2964
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:50,840
time and test.

2965
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

2966
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,200
to understand each other.

2967
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:55,440
I think we can

2968
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,240
we can

2969
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,680
in life

2970
01:54:58,680 --> 01:54:59,840
your weaknesses

2971
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,670
or advantages,

2972
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:01,840
or hobbies,

2973
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,910
or hobbies.

2974
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:04,560
Come on.

2975
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,600
and make a decision.

2976
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,320
is a kind of respect for each other

2977
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,440
and choices.

2978
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,080
Because they may need to

2979
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:15,640
in relationships.

2980
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,830
Communicate more.

2981
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,840
Here's my message.

2982
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,040
To Su Zihao.

2983
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,080
Your confession time has begun.

2984
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:32,600
Please choose you.

2985
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,440
Take your time.

2986
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:36,320
Please choose the girl you want to confess to.

2987
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,320
and run towards her exclamation mark.

2988
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,040
A, Wang Yin-cheol.

2989
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,320
B Brandisie.

2990
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,240
C He Wenxin

2991
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,470
D Rollin.

2992
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,680
That's all.

2993
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,400
Are you nervous?

2994
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:54,040
Let's go. Let's go.

2995
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,280
Let's go.

2996
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,360
I'm a little nervous.

2997
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,120
Don't be nervous.

2998
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:01,440
First, don't talk too much.

2999
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,750
Don't shake your legs.

3000
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,440
Don't touch yourself.

3001
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,200
My muscles are a little spasm.

3002
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,200
Don't spasm.

3003
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,360
I'm nervous too.

3004
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,200
Bye. Good luck.

3005
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,800
Don't cry when you get rejected.

3006
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,640
Don't touch yourself.

3007
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,350
No.

3008
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:20,880
Okay.

3009
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,880
Believe in yourself.

3010
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,190
Come on. Bye.

3011
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:25,520
There's no turning back.

3012
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,160
Okay.

3013
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:31,480
I can accept this result.

3014
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,270
I've thought it through.

3015
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,360
You did a good job today.

3016
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,240
You don't need to give him an out.

3017
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:40,400
I can't give him any comments.

3018
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,310
I just... OK.

3019
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:41,840
I understand.

3020
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:42,800
That's how I am.

3021
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,350
Yes.

3022
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:45,470
I like it.

3023
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,600
must be passionate.

3024
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,640
It must be sincere.

3025
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:49,880
It must be true.

3026
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,230
It must be emotional.

3027
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,070
I didn't feel

3028
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:57,440
from the guy just now.

3029
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,120
I don't think you need to feel sorry for him.

3030
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,520
Be the best version of yourself.

3031
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,320
You can see it. You can see it.

3032
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:03,920
is enough.

3033
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:05,950
You're self-confident.

3034
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:07,870
I think you need to be proud.

3035
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:11,480
I didn't do that well.

3036
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,440
I'll do my best.

3037
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,110
Okay.

3038
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:19,390
Before you start dating,

3039
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:20,320
let me check.

3040
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:22,160
Okay.

3041
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,350
I'm worried about you.

3042
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:25,790
I'm so bullied.

3043
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:26,840
Okay, no problem.

3044
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,280
Let me introduce you first.

3045
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,400
Come on.

3046
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,160
I will still love you.

3047
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:36,760
So cheesy.

3048
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,470
Help!

3049
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,280
I'm so nervous.

3050
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,600
He's taking a deep breath.

3051
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,230
I'm under a lot of pressure.

3052
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:50,200
Come on. Come on.

3053
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,960
I've been waiting for you again today.

3054
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,110
I've been waiting for you.

3055
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:58,960
It's here. It's here.

3056
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,560
Long hair is pretty.

3057
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,830
It surprised me.

3058
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:18,680
Wait.

3059
01:59:20,030 --> 01:59:20,510
I'm nervous.

3060
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:21,240
I'm very nervous.

3061
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,200
Me too.

3062
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,280
Come on. Come on.

3063
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,320
has my own meaning.

3064
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:26,880
Do you remember

3065
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,080
our first date

3066
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,040
is not a Cupid date.

3067
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:29,880
It's a date

3068
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,360
Do you remember what flowers I bought?

3069
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,040
Shaoyao.

3070
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:34,400
Yes.

3071
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,320
Do you know

3072
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,440
what peony symbolizes?

3073
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:40,240
I'm shy.

3074
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:43,000
This time,

3075
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,880
I bought tulips.

3076
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,240
You bought two.

3077
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:46,590
Because they are...

3078
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:47,200
Thank you.

3079
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,560
I think the meaning of flowers is different.

3080
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,840
Red tulips.

3081
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,190
It symbolizes love confession.

3082
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,000
It means "love". It means "love".

3083
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,470
It's like this. It's like this.

3084
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,480
having happiness

3085
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,240
and love you forever.

3086
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:08,670
"Like this, like this." "Like this."

3087
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:09,630
If I remember correctly,

3088
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:10,750
we sat there and chatted.

3089
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,640
When we were in the room,

3090
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,400
I looked at your leg.

3091
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,360
Then your arm...

3092
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:15,200
I said,

3093
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,080
Why are you so dry?

3094
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:18,400
Hello.

3095
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:18,680
And...

3096
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,360
Body breast?

3097
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,880
Yes, body lotion.

3098
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,040
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.

3099
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,350
I bought two

3100
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:25,440
And this

3101
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,360
It seems to be a set.

3102
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:26,910
I forgot.

3103
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:29,120
You bought too much.

3104
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,880
Put it here. Put it here.

3105
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,520
Open it yourself.

3106
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,280
It's like this

3107
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:35,550
This is...

3108
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:38,160
I'll buy you two phone cards.

3109
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:39,800
It's like this

3110
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:42,640
If we are together,

3111
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,320
I'm afraid I can't reach you.

3112
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:50,680
Just in case.

3113
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:52,510
This is very useful.

3114
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:57,520
It's been a long time since I've been so formal.

3115
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,160
Do you remember

3116
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:01,200
I texted you yesterday

3117
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,640
after you gave me my perfume.

3118
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,710
I'm not saying

3119
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:05,680
Thank you very much

3120
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:07,600
for giving me your favorite perfume.

3121
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,160
I thought

3122
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,520
I thought I wanted to share

3123
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,030
with you.

3124
02:01:16,030 --> 02:01:17,600
So,

3125
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,150
I'm afraid Looney will steal your perfume.

3126
02:01:21,150 --> 02:01:21,790
Here you go.

3127
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,440
Gosh.

3128
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,270
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

3129
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:28,120
But I didn't bring it.

3130
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,470
Actually, I thought

3131
02:01:29,470 --> 02:01:30,880
I bought one myself.

3132
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,800
I bought it for you today.

3133
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:32,720
You don't have to buy it yourself.

3134
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:39,320
It's not the first time

3135
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,320
giving you a doll.

3136
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:42,240
You told me

3137
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,920
you like to sleep with your sheep.

3138
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,480
Do you remember

3139
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,240
You need to do it.

3140
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,720
when you went out.

3141
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:52,800
and brought me a puppy's eye mask.

3142
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,950
You said I looked like a "puppy".

3143
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:54,800
I thought

3144
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:55,840
I'll do as you say.

3145
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:59,000
I'll treat myself like a puppy.

3146
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,680
I said if you want to go to Japan,

3147
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:09,440
I can't go with you.

3148
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,910
I'll bring this puppy

3149
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:12,030
with the puppy.

3150
02:02:12,030 --> 02:02:13,520
and sleep with it.

3151
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,800
I'll accompany you.

3152
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:18,590
Yes.

3153
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:19,070
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

3154
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:19,800
I like dogs.

3155
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:20,480
A black dog.

3156
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,840
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

3157
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:25,520
This is the only time in life.

3158
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,320
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.

3159
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,790
It's good. It's good.

3160
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:31,550
As long as I can express my feelings,

3161
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:32,510
Come on.

3162
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:33,880
I can accept

3163
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:35,000
I can accept it.

3164
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,040
What I want to say is

3165
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,270
our first date.

3166
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:39,800
I prepared everything

3167
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:40,830
for the moment.

3168
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:42,480
I didn't know you were going to Japan.

3169
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,240
But after that date,

3170
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:45,360
you told me you were going to Japan.

3171
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,870
This gift is mostly for

3172
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:48,760
for the future.

3173
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:49,040
Yes.

3174
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,320
I've prepared

3175
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,400
So I prepared these

3176
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,280
just

3177
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,640
when I wanted you to go later,

3178
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,560
I wasn't that worried.

3179
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,440
or things will go better.

3180
02:02:58,270 --> 02:02:59,120
Okay.

3181
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:00,400
I bought it too.

3182
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,350
I think

3183
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:06,040
very meaningful.

3184
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:07,200
I didn't expect

3185
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,760
it would be such a coincidence.

3186
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:10,720
It's like this.

3187
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,510
It's a chick.

3188
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:15,390
Aren't you born in the year of chicken?

3189
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,200
When I picked it up,

3190
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,560
I found

3191
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:20,480
What is it?

3192
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,560
It's a dragon.

3193
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,310
I was born in the year of the dragon too.

3194
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:30,960
It's just a coincidence.

3195
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,080
The buyer told me

3196
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,800
there is a Liuhe.

3197
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,200
Dragon and chicken.

3198
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,710
They are helping secretly.

3199
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:40,400
Really?

3200
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:40,960
Yes.

3201
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:41,790
What a coincidence.

3202
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:42,560
What a coincidence!

3203
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:43,120
What a coincidence.

3204
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:44,480
I didn't know

3205
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,760
It's like this. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.

3206
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,960
It is.

3207
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,510
When I saw this chick,

3208
02:03:48,510 --> 02:03:50,560
I thought I should buy it.

3209
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:55,230
Left hand.

3210
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:57,760
Good.

3211
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,480
It suits you.

3212
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:20,280
I wrote a letter.

3213
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:25,950
What are you doing?

3214
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:27,390
Don't be nervous.

3215
02:04:27,390 --> 02:04:28,240
I'm nervous too.

3216
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:28,670
Wait.

3217
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,680
Don't be nervous.

3218
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:31,200
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

3219
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:35,760
Hello, Su Zihao.

3220
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:37,880
The first day I met you,

3221
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:39,070
I thought it through.

3222
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:42,000
None of them seems to be my ideal type this time.

3223
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:47,000
But it's really easy to talk to you.

3224
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,920
If you don't mind, I'll hold out my stomach.

3225
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,720
I'm really full.

3226
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:51,760
No problem.

3227
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:54,640
You'll take the initiative.

3228
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:55,920
Although there are many formulas

3229
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,680
your formula,

3230
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:58,800
But at least after that,

3231
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,440
I'm willing to extend ten minutes for you.

3232
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:05,400
Where were we?

3233
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:07,920
After thinking about it,

3234
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,600
If on the first day,

3235
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,480
I chose you to take me back to the house.

3236
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,720
Will we get to know each other faster?

3237
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,480
But I still think

3238
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,880
the current development order is the best.

3239
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,040
and the most suitable one for us.

3240
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,280
We regret it when we pass by.

3241
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,120
When we sent the wrong feelings,

3242
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:24,600
we firmly made our choices.

3243
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,520
Every contradiction

3244
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,550
is the highlight of our relationship.

3245
02:05:27,550 --> 02:05:28,720
Like you said,

3246
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,920
If everything goes well,

3247
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,550
life will be boring.

3248
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,790
You're not my type,

3249
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:35,320
You're not tall,

3250
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,040
and small eyes.

3251
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,480
But when I got to know you,

3252
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,920
I did neglect these things.

3253
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,710
including the age I care about the most.

3254
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,750
I know you're younger than me.

3255
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:48,000
but I have to admit that

3256
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,760
you're very mature.

3257
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:50,800
Your personality

3258
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,040
is also my type.

3259
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,160
You're delicate, gentle and considerate.

3260
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,640
and a little humorous.

3261
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:58,000
You'll remember what I said.

3262
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,520
Green.

3263
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,040
and willing to act for me.

3264
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,350
and dare to break some rules.

3265
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:06,080
These are what I like

3266
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,280
and I need.

3267
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:12,350
Nervous.

3268
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:13,440
Don't be nervous.

3269
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:15,550
You know I'm dull.

3270
02:06:15,550 --> 02:06:16,990
and a bit old-fashioned.

3271
02:06:16,990 --> 02:06:19,040
But you kept guiding me

3272
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:20,350
and took me away again and again.

3273
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:22,720
I'm immersed in the inner world

3274
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,870
Talking to me

3275
02:06:23,870 --> 02:06:24,670
Thank you.

3276
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,960
The girls said that

3277
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,840
you were dancing at their thunder point.

3278
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,440
But I didn't expect

3279
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:35,920
Sometimes,

3280
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,880
I feel comfortable.

3281
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:38,840
Maybe this is the reason

3282
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:40,190
we get along.

3283
02:06:40,190 --> 02:06:42,320
You said the car where Cupid went on a date

3284
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,030
is the turning point of your feelings for me.

3285
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:46,160
Then my change may be

3286
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:47,800
the moment

3287
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,950
to celebrate my birthday.

3288
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:52,280
Wait.

3289
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,600
It's your birthday. You can't leave yet.

3290
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:57,080
I thought you were shining.

3291
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,200
I felt very warm.

3292
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:02,880
And when you said you needed me,

3293
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,440
you gave me a reason

3294
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:07,040
to stay with you and Susu.

3295
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,680
Although I'm a safe relationship,

3296
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:11,070
but I really

3297
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:13,400
I need this kind of favourite and proactive expression.

3298
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:15,440
I look forward to

3299
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:16,990
What kind of text will you send me?

3300
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:18,750
I want to know how you feel today.

3301
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:20,920
I want to know what's on your mind.

3302
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:21,720
Be it happy

3303
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,070
or sad,

3304
02:07:23,070 --> 02:07:25,790
I want to know what you think about every day.

3305
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:26,800
Maybe liking someone

3306
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,480
to know everything about him.

3307
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:30,200
I'm not good at talking.

3308
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,320
but I must be an excellent listener.

3309
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,120
So...

3310
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:35,200
Harry, I don't want you to suffer internal consumption.

3311
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:37,520
or pressure yourself.

3312
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,230
I can be your emotional trash can.

3313
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:40,240
As long as you are willing to find me,

3314
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,720
I will always be there.

3315
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,230
I will face it with you

3316
02:07:43,230 --> 02:07:44,760
Come on. Come on. Come on.

3317
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,030
So good.

3318
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:57,200
Oh no, I'm under pressure.

3319
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:06,960
I...

3320
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,350
Okay.

3321
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,720
I'll stand up and read.

3322
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:21,720
Wait.

3323
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,160
Come on. Come on.

3324
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,990
This letter shouldn't be emotional.

3325
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:34,270
but I think I'll cry.

3326
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:36,030
It's been 15 days

3327
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:37,520
since we first met.

3328
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:39,710
Although time is short,

3329
02:08:39,710 --> 02:08:41,520
I have the chance to meet you every day.

3330
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:41,950
It's been two or three months

3331
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:43,550
for two or three months.

3332
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:45,560
You told me

3333
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,360
you told me

3334
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:48,160
you're slow to warm up.

3335
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,720
So when a person

3336
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:51,280
(who actively released the signal to me,)

3337
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,990
I want to seize this opportunity.

3338
02:08:52,990 --> 02:08:54,560
Because I'm afraid we won't meet again

3339
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,840
we won't meet again.

3340
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:58,080
I'm very happy

3341
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,440
when I first met you,

3342
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,520
I could celebrate your birthday with you.

3343
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,200
You left me a whole day.

3344
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:05,150
You asked me a lot of questions on my birthday.

3345
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:06,640
A very memorable question.

3346
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,030
You asked me

3347
02:09:08,030 --> 02:09:09,520
if I'd have a good life.

3348
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,720
I said,

3349
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:12,280
Actually, my thoughts of dating

3350
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,630
is my ordinary

3351
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:15,070
I'm already passionate to others.

3352
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:16,670
After that, if my passion

3353
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:18,360
it's a bit crazy for others.

3354
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,270
I hope my preparation today

3355
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:23,390
can give you

3356
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:24,720
a very disappointing confession.

3357
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:28,400
When I choose someone firmly,

3358
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,240
I will rush at any cost

3359
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,440
to express my love.

3360
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:32,600
What do you want to eat?

3361
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,520
I'll eat this then.

3362
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:35,280
Who cooked it?

3363
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:35,960
I cooked it.

3364
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:37,600
I fell asleep at four last night.

3365
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:39,070
I've been doing a lot of strategies.

3366
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,070
If we go on a date,

3367
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:48,990
we can't go on a date.

3368
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:50,840
We've been watching movies.

3369
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,710
Watching TV?

3370
02:09:51,710 --> 02:09:53,470
Today is a perfect day.

3371
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,550
Look at me.

3372
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,400
You're really pretty.

3373
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,670
I know you'll doubt me.

3374
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:02,080
and my feelings.

3375
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:04,240
You would ask why I changed so fast.

3376
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:05,080
In words,

3377
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:06,320
I may not be able to express

3378
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,200
what I want to say.

3379
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,920
But all my feelings are in my actions.

3380
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,080
What can't be controlled is love.

3381
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:11,640
If a person

3382
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:12,990
stay sober and control,

3383
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:13,560
That's not love.

3384
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:14,480
Love is not sober

3385
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,440
can't be controlled.

3386
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,160
That's why

3387
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:17,400
I want to be with you every day.

3388
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,270
Stay together.

3389
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,200
My sister will say

3390
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,480
I'm like a plaster.

3391
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:21,920
Gum is always behind you.

3392
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,120
In the handwritten letter you wrote to me,

3393
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:25,680
you mentioned

3394
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:27,120
I prepared so much for you.

3395
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,240
Don't you know

3396
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,470
should be at ease

3397
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:31,120
and accept my kindness to you?

3398
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:32,160
But from now on,

3399
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:33,360
I hope you can accept

3400
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:34,590
my kindness to you.

3401
02:10:34,590 --> 02:10:35,520
Because I think you deserve it.

3402
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,360
You're not good at expressing yourself.

3403
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:41,920
It's really hard to express.

3404
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:42,640
So I will take the initiative

3405
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:44,030
to express my feelings.

3406
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:44,880
But I...

3407
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:45,920
need your response.

3408
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,560
Or I don't know

3409
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,920
if I did it right.

3410
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:52,160
Being sensitive is our common point.

3411
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,080
Although we are sensitive,

3412
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,280
I hope you can tell me

3413
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,160
you can tell me.

3414
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:57,400
Tell me what's bothering you.

3415
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:58,880
Safety is very important.

3416
02:10:58,880 --> 02:10:59,520
You told me

3417
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:00,080
You have a pet phrase.

3418
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:00,990
Say sorry.

3419
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,390
I hope this pet phrase

3420
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:04,320
to be

3421
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,080
Because I want to be good to you.

3422
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,200
and let you down.

3423
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:07,920
In the past,

3424
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,950
I only liked you more.

3425
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:11,800
You'll see me

3426
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,840
to care about my emotions.

3427
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:18,720
What are you doing?

3428
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:20,510
I'll tell you later.

3429
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,070
You will explain it

3430
02:11:23,070 --> 02:11:24,080
when there's a misunderstanding.

3431
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:26,360
Sorry.

3432
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,960
I regretted it after I sent it.

3433
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,790
Think of me when you go out.

3434
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:31,120
and buy it for me.

3435
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:33,240
What do you think I like?

3436
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:34,040
I like it.

3437
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:34,800
I like it.

3438
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,510
Where did you get it?

3439
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:37,200
It's a gift for you

3440
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:37,950
It's from Tata.

3441
02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:39,200
Here.

3442
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:39,960
I bought you something.

3443
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:40,350
I'll give it to you later.

3444
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:41,840
It's okay. I bought it for you.

3445
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:42,200
Okay.

3446
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:43,390
I'll buy it for you too.

3447
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,880
Does it smell?

3448
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,440
It's so cute. I'll buy it for you.

3449
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:48,280
When I don't want to

3450
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:49,240
pouring water for my sister,

3451
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:50,640
when I pour water for my sister.

3452
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,840
I want water.

3453
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:52,880
Drink some water. Go ahead.

3454
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:54,720
What are you doing?

3455
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:55,640
Let me pour you some.

3456
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:56,720
Get me a glass of water.

3457
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,760
She's already there.

3458
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,960
You'll pick up new dishes when eating.

3459
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:01,310
and give it to me first.

3460
02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:01,720
Thank you.

3461
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,430
Don't...

3462
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:02,840
Yes.

3463
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:03,710
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

3464
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,920
A lot of details may be

3465
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,480
the subconscious of liking someone.

3466
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,950
I saw it and remembered it.

3467
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:11,480
I'm very happy.

3468
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:12,960
Come on.

3469
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:13,920
Come to me.

3470
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,640
Come and hold my hand.

3471
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:16,600
That's what I thought.

3472
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:18,110
It's like this.

3473
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:18,910
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

3474
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:19,710
Thank you.

3475
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:21,440
And thank you for liking me.

3476
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:30,400
And...

3477
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:35,390
One last question.

3478
02:12:35,870 --> 02:12:36,510
Question.

3479
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:40,030
Well,

3480
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:46,720
Will you be with me?

3481
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:49,200
Will you be with me?

3482
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,190
Yes.

3483
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:45,400
Before I came here,

3484
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:46,910
I had a peach-flavored fruit cube.

3485
02:13:46,910 --> 02:13:47,520
to boost my courage.

3486
02:13:48,190 --> 02:13:48,720
Really?

3487
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,280
It's 23 degrees Celsius

3488
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,670
let me go at once.

3489
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:54,160
It seems that many important moments

3490
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,040
in many important moments.

3491
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:56,350
Yes, I'm an introvert.

3492
02:13:56,350 --> 02:13:57,440
On the first day you came,

3493
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:58,270
I had

3494
02:13:58,270 --> 02:13:59,320
a lot of peach-flavored fruit cube.

3495
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:00,600
You always ask me to taste grapefruit.

3496
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:02,270
I thought you wanted E.

3497
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:03,920
It's like the fruit jar I won for the first time.

3498
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:04,800
It tastes like grapefruit.

3499
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:05,920
Because of you,

3500
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,840
I became E.

3501
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:07,920
Let's mutual complementement.

3502
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:09,720
Cheers.

3503
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:27,360
Let's go.

3504
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:27,840
Let's go.

3505
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,520
Who's here?

3506
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:39,000
Hand.

3507
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:40,440
Soup.

3508
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:55,800
Here, cover it for a while.

3509
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:03,160
Who are you waiting for?

3510
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:04,600
Waiting for everyone.

3511
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:05,400
Why?

3512
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,160
Because we confessed our love here.

3513
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,560
Really

3514
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,440
Are you inside?

3515
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:09,920
They're inside.

3516
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,520
Of course.

3517
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,360
Well...

3518
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,230
Don't be too jealous.

3519
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:16,830
Your confession here

3520
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:18,480
because it's too cold.

3521
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:19,320
I want to end it quickly.

3522
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:32,800
I'm afraid you'll be too cold.

3523
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,280
You're quite generous.

3524
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:51,040
Coming.

3525
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:54,000
Sit here.

3526
02:15:54,430 --> 02:15:55,480
What are you holding?

3527
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,880
Isn't it obvious?

3528
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,160
We didn't spend any.

3529
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:59,230
You didn't.

3530
02:15:59,230 --> 02:16:00,080
Let's sit here.

3531
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:03,520
Let me see.

3532
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,360
You have long hair.

3533
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,830
He said you look good with long hair.

3534
02:16:08,830 --> 02:16:09,310
Yes.

3535
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:13,280
You can have the center.

3536
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,680
Yes, the center.

3537
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:15,480
Really?

3538
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:16,030
Yes.

3539
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:16,830
Let's sit here.

3540
02:16:16,830 --> 02:16:18,430
Really, just sit here.

3541
02:16:21,470 --> 02:16:22,960
The two groups at the back...

3542
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:25,040
You are...

3543
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,200
Are you "welding" already?

3544
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,110
Are you stuck to each other?

3545
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:36,559
You're using magic glue.

3546
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:37,760
Don't lean on me.

3547
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:40,670
Tom.

3548
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:42,160
How do you feel now?

3549
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,040
I'm so happy.

3550
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:49,600
Tell us about yours.

3551
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:50,910
Our...

3552
02:16:50,910 --> 02:16:51,760
is

3553
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,680
I think if I have to take my feelings seriously,

3554
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:56,440
we might not have enough time.

3555
02:16:57,469 --> 02:16:59,230
So we want to

3556
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:00,320
to continue

3557
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:01,840
after this.

3558
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,840
and get to know each other.

3559
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:04,799
Besides,

3560
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:06,750
have a very tacit understanding today.

3561
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:07,639
Yes, a gift.

3562
02:17:07,639 --> 02:17:08,719
Show them together.

3563
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:09,280
They are all

3564
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,590
for free.

3565
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,320
A bracelet?

3566
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:11,760
Yes.

3567
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:12,350
Very tacit this time.

3568
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:13,400
We're in sync again.

3569
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:16,030
They gave me one too.

3570
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:16,559
Yes.

3571
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:17,879
Hua, tell us.

3572
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:21,440
I think we have a tacit understanding.

3573
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:22,959
Well,

3574
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:24,350
Tarri is also

3575
02:17:24,350 --> 02:17:26,879
who has a long relationship observation period.

3576
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:30,240
I didn't understand him at first.

3577
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:32,160
He said he was under observation for so long.

3578
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,920
I think it might be a dangerous speech.

3579
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,389
He's a bad boy.

3580
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:37,400
to push away.

3581
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:38,520
But after I met him,

3582
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:39,520
I think this is

3583
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:41,469
very serious about his relationship.

3584
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:43,870
After we leave the house,

3585
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:45,469
I think we will have more contact.

3586
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:47,870
The end of the house

3587
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:49,240
It doesn't mean us.

3588
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:49,950
Our end

3589
02:17:49,950 --> 02:17:51,709
may represent our beginning.

3590
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,360
Okay.

3591
02:17:58,590 --> 02:17:59,440
Is it good?

3592
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:00,990
Then cry.

3593
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:06,639
Did your confession go well?

3594
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,920
They're all together.

3595
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,120
How could it not go well?

3596
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:11,959
How smooth it is.

3597
02:18:11,959 --> 02:18:12,830
Of course.

3598
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:16,000
It's like tripping.

3599
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,280
Is there anything in the middle?

3600
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:18,959
Let me tell you.

3601
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:19,320
Okay.

3602
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:22,200
I'm Tom.

3603
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:24,719
And...

3604
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,080
This is my girlfriend, Susu.

3605
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,360
I'm going to cry.

3606
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:37,309
Help!

3607
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:38,480
Don't cry.

3608
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:41,400
Hello, I'm Su Ziyi.

3609
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:44,280
And

3610
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,360
This is my boyfriend Tom.

3611
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:48,080
Thank you.

3612
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,799
Kiss.

3613
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:52,510
Kiss.

3614
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,719
My eyes are welding to them.

3615
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:01,559
Kiss.

3616
02:19:01,559 --> 02:19:02,430
Kiss.

3617
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:05,469
OK?

3618
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:08,959
Kiss.

3619
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:10,320
Su siblings.

3620
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:14,430
Kiss!

3621
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:16,030
Soup.

3622
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:16,440
Hurry up.

3623
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:17,280
As a man,

3624
02:19:17,719 --> 02:19:18,200
Here.

3625
02:19:39,639 --> 02:19:40,760
So cheesy.

3626
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,320
I'm not used to it.

3627
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:46,400
We were laughing so happily.

3628
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:47,799
What about you?

3629
02:19:47,799 --> 02:19:49,240
This friend with muscle spasm.

3630
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:53,680
My name is Su Zihao.

3631
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:55,520
And

3632
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,640
This is mine.

3633
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:58,560
Girlfriend.

3634
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:05,840
Congratulations.

3635
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,600
It's my turn to introduce.

3636
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:09,720
My name is Rolyn.

3637
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:11,400
Nice to meet you.

3638
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,880
I'm also happy to be friends with you.

3639
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,120
Who's next to you?

3640
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:16,280
Next to me is

3641
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,160
a stranger.

3642
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:27,720
Next to me is my boyfriend, Su Zihao.

3643
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:36,880
Harry, give me a kiss.

3644
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,720
He can't wait any longer.

3645
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:03,400
Aren't you going to show me your ticket?

3646
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:04,440
I want to show my ticket.

3647
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:06,120
Look at the ticket I drew for Fatty.

3648
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:07,360
I thought I'd show my muscles.

3649
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:08,680
Me too.

3650
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:10,920
I really drew it.

3651
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,680
I received a ticket today.

3652
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,480
From where?

3653
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:14,920
You can write any address.

3654
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,440
But you have to exchange it with me within a year.

3655
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:17,880
Otherwise, the expiration date will be canceled.

3656
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:21,280
Let's fly from Chaoyang to the Marine

3657
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:24,320
Singapore.

3658
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,120
and go to college in Singapore.

3659
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:28,240
I decided to study again.

3660
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,200
I burst into tears.

3661
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:32,760
I cried when I read the diary.

3662
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:35,080
After that, he told me

3663
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:36,240
he decided

3664
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:37,440
to confess his love.

3665
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:38,520
Have you made up your mind?

3666
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,960
He said I had.

3667
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:41,880
Then I decided to confess my feelings.

3668
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:43,200
So he told me a lot.

3669
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,280
And my mood

3670
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:45,720
I was so emotional.

3671
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:47,080
Then he left.

3672
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,440
No one would confess to me.

3673
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:52,440
Then I kept waiting.

3674
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:53,000
and waited.

3675
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:53,960
He came in.

3676
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:56,960
Then he came in with the gift.

3677
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:58,440
Then he was at the door.

3678
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:59,160
at the door.

3679
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:00,120
He said

3680
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:01,400
It's okay. I'm here.

3681
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:07,920
I'm touched twice, really.

3682
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,600
I'm touched too.

3683
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:10,760
Because I'm already very relaxed.

3684
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,480
I think it's over.

3685
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,680
I was relaxed and sat there.

3686
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:18,280
I was so touched and touched.

3687
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:29,680
Great.

3688
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:30,800
Do you want to show my gift?

3689
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:32,760
It's too big.

3690
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:33,480
I think it's okay.

3691
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,040
This is my dog.

3692
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:36,600
and the flower.

3693
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,680
Is this Bo Niu?

3694
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,680
Yes, let me show you.

3695
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:43,160
This is Poppet Girl.

3696
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:43,840
So cute.

3697
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:46,760
West Highland.

3698
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:47,920
I learned another thing.

3699
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,240
Remember to ask me to continue your class.

3700
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:51,360
Next time you confess to Xiao Ling.

3701
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:54,280
Okay.

3702
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,120
Xiao Ling is happy when you cry.

3703
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:58,840
This is...

3704
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:09,440
House.

3705
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:13,080
Soup.

3706
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:13,840
The first person.

3707
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,120
The soup is thinner.

3708
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:16,120
Thank you.

3709
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:17,080
The second one.

3710
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:18,520
My forehead.

3711
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:21,320
The third one.

3712
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,400
Is the heroine...

3713
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,000
Harry.

3714
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,600
Stagnant.

3715
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,160
I'm so flustered.

3716
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,560
You're flustered.

3717
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:39,480
So bad.

3718
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:40,920
Really?

3719
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:43,480
Xinxin.

3720
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:48,080
So handsome, Terri.

3721
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:50,360
Cupid's date.

3722
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,640
So sweet.

3723
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:58,960
Trust me, Tata.

3724
02:23:58,960 --> 02:23:59,880
Come on.

3725
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:14,960
So sweet.

3726
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,800
Take a look. Turn around.

3727
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:27,920
Oh no.

3728
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,440
I'm falling in love.

3729
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,040
So sweet.

3730
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,720
That's it.

3731
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,720
I won't be a comedian starting tomorrow

3732
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:54,520
I won't be a comedian

3733
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,320
Come on.

3734
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,840
I think you are an excellent person.

3735
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:08,680
To be honest,

3736
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,640
Turn around.

3737
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,960
Get that out.

3738
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:23,560
Help me.

3739
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,240
I want to cry even more.

3740
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,800
I'm sorry.

3741
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,400
Time flies.

3742
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,600
It's too fast. It passed in a blink of an eye.

3743
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,520
It's the first time

3744
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:55,760
with so many people.

3745
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:56,920
24 hours a day.

3746
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,440
24 hours a day.

3747
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,640
I feel that many things can't be recorded.

3748
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,360
Happiness can't be recorded in time.

3749
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:05,600
It can only be felt with eyes and heart.

3750
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,680
Actually, I hope to stay in the small house

3751
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,400
for a long time.

3752
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:14,320
for a long, long time

3753
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,280
for a long time.

3754
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:20,120
We'll have a lot of group activities

3755
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:21,400
and cook.

3756
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,480
Sitting together makes me feel like a family.

3757
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:28,160
Happy birthday to you

3758
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,400
I can't do it anymore.

3759
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:31,240
Actually,

3760
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:32,880
afraid of loneliness.

3761
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:33,840
In life,

3762
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,200
in life.

3763
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:36,520
Now, before going to bed,

3764
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:38,040
before sleep.

3765
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:38,760
Every day when we eat,

3766
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,120
when we eat every day.

3767
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,680
In the past 20 days,

3768
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:42,920
I feel like

3769
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:44,680
home.

3770
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:47,760
I'm very grateful

3771
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:48,920
I'm very grateful.

3772
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:51,040
I'm also very lucky to have this experience.

3773
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,280
Whether in life,

3774
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:54,800
my attitude towards love,

3775
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,680
and friendship,

3776
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:57,960
about friendship.

3777
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,680
It's fate

3778
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:04,480
to gather here for over 20 days.

3779
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,320
Eat and drink together.

3780
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:07,960
We're all together.

3781
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:09,040
I feel very lucky

3782
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,400
and very romantic.

3783
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,480
Like that little bird

3784
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:13,040
waiting for mom to get the earthworms back.

3785
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:14,640
We're really like playing house.

3786
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,240
We're a family now.

3787
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:21,880
Cheers.

3788
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:25,600
Let's go wild and enjoy the world.

3789
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:28,440
The first season of "Love Sisters".

3790
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:30,720
It's a wrap.

3795
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,640
On the news, the clients are searching "Super Drama Show". and watch more interesting content.

3796
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:33,760
They're searching for "Love Siblings" over a hundred times. It's all about Baidu Baidu.
