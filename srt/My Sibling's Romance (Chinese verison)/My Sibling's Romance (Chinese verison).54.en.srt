It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

A pair.

14

(a glass hydrochloric acid shampoo)

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
and sponsored it.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,280
We're a loving family member group.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,680
It's the 12th episode in a blink of an eye.

The last episode.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm so sad.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,720
Yes.

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm looking forward to

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
what will happen in this episode.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Last week we went through

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
a heart party for men and women.

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,400
And after a date with no regrets,

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
the night before the confession,

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,440
each group

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
is a little uncertain.

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,840
What kind of story

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,800
on the last day?

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
We're going to

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
of this episode.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,280
Will you be with me?

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
Yes.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,040
Hello.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Hello

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
What are you cooking?

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,079
I only know how to cook soup.

57
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,720
My limit.

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,160
Hello, Yinbo.

59
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Hello.

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,640
You are washing vegetables

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm done.

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,640
So fast?

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,480
The stupid bird flies first.

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,280
So kind.

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,840
Okay.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,920
One dish for each of you.

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,880
Think about what to cook.

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
I'll cook Chaoshan beef.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll make you a seafood.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,560
and Ningbo cuisine.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Go downstairs.

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,600
A letter.

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
(To members of the house.)

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
The first dinner in the house

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,640
It's the taste of moms

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,880
This is the last dinner of the house tonight.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Please make one dish respectively

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,000
and end this journey.

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
It's over.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
So fast.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Hello.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
Do you want to cut it yourself?

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
You want to make beans?

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Your beans are so old.

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
To be honest,

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Isn't this the same as you?

87
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,720
The beans are definitely older than me.

88
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,200
An old man should eat some old beans.

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You need to cook it.

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm scared.

91
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,400
Didn't you say it's cooked?

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Anyway, Yinbo, you eat first.

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,520
Really?

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,560
Then one less confessing tomorrow.

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
I was afraid that Yinbo would confess.

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
I'll poison him to death today.

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,880
I like this kind of

98
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
with a joke.

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,880
It's cute.

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,640
It's obvious to let it go.

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,440
Yes.

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Who's home?

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,840
Brother.

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,960
Why are you three cooking together?

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
What do you think? Is this scene awkward?

106
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
I had a barbecue with Tae-seo yesterday.

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,800
We'll cook together today.

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,440
Is there a problem?

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,159
Yes.

110
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,640
I don't think it's me and Tae-seo.

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,040
Brother.

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Guess what I made.

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,200
Fried pork with chili.

114
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,840
No.

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Fried eggs with chili.

116
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
I bought something. I'll make it later.

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
You guys go ahead.

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll go upstairs first.

119
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,520
How was your date today?

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
What do you think?

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
We're on a date today.

122
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
I asked him

123
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Zero to ten.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,760
Zero means no feeling.

125
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,000
Ten means love.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
How much am I to him?

127
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,200
He said 9.5.

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
Then I said,

129
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Really?

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Then he said

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
Then I said what you said

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
will become evidence in court.

133
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
He said he knew

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
Xiao Ling is happier because of this 9.5.

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
Yes.

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm going downstairs to check my dish.

137
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
What are you doing?

139
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Fried pork with chili.

140
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Although I can't cook it

141
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
Just do it.

142
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Let your men help you.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,880
Where are my brothers?

144
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,440
Tell him to come back and help me.

145
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,880
You can prepare those to be cut first.

146
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,680
I've never cut anything.

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Try it.

148
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,320
I can help you.

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
This dish is for you.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
Here you are.

151
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,040
It's okay. I can cut something for you.

152
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,280
If you're afraid of cutting your hands,

153
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
Okay.

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
Give me the knife.

155
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm smiling.

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
Let me try.

157
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,960
You can't do it. Don't.

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,480
Why?

159
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
Why can't I?

160
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm afraid you'll cut your hand.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Stop cutting your hands.

162
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,680
Why don't you try it first?

163
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,320
Let you try it.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,760
Yes, slowly.

165
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,960
But I think I cut this too thick.

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
Forget it. It's thick.

167
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Then cut the chili for me.

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Forget it. I'll do this.

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Go get the chili.

170
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,240
Let me do it.

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll change this.

172
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
Half and half.

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
Go get the green pepper

174
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,320
And garlic and ginger.

175
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,760
Yes, get the ginger with garlic.

176
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
We'll put it away after you finish.

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
We'll fry it after they finish it.

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Okay.

179
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,760
Look, they're sweet again.

180
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
So sweet.

181
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
Map.

182
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,080
You play with it?

183
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,560
No.

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
When they're done,

185
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
I'll cook that for Xiaoling.

186
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Play with it.

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,880
Why don't you go and see Xiao Ling?

188
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,840
Fried pork with chili.

189
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Okay.

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm really worried. You two have fun.

191
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
Let's take a look.

192
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go.

193
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,520
The soup is back.

194
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,640
Let me see where you fell.

195
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,440
This...

196
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
Blood all over the floor.

197
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
Let me see.

198
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,440
Here.

199
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
Poor thing.

200
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,640
Are you bleeding from inside?

201
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
There's a lot of blood inside.

202
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Nose.

203
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Su Ziyi, what are you cooking?

204
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,600
Sorry.

205
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,480
Soup, what's wrong with you?

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
Poor thing.

207
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,200
Poor you. Just kiss me.

208
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,840
What?

209
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,240
Kiss me.

210
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,040
Just say you feel sorry.

211
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,800
Poor thing.

212
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,160
Who?

213
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,280
You.

214
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm fine.

215
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Does it still hurt?

216
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Touching it still hurts.

217
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
You don't need me, Su Ziyi.

218
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
I need you. Don't go.

219
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
Please don't leave me.

220
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
Pour me some oil, Su Zihao.

221
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,840
What oil?

222
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,480
I love oil.

223
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,280
Please.

224
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Stir-fry.

225
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,680
Just pull the back like this.

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,040
There's action guidance next to it.

227
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,200
Yes.

228
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
Take a seat.

229
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,040
and then come back to “poison” them.

230
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
They should be ready soon.

231
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
I don't know. I have to cook.

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,880
I hope you'll be fine tomorrow.

233
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm relieved to see this.

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
This is the right feeling.

235
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,280
It's over.

236
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
Why are you wearing a couple outfit with me?

237
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,600
Learn from me.

238
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
The morning I went out first.

239
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
Whose dishes are we missing now?

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,920
Just Tom's dish.

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Su Ziyi helps Tom.

242
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
I'll cheer for you.

243
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay.

244
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,000
Come on, Tom.

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Then don't. It's more stressful.

246
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
No eggs.

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
We're out

248
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,760
Bro.

249
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,040
No.

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,240
The sky has collapsed.

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
I can only make eggs.

252
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
Tom, the sky has collapsed.

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
Eggs!

254
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
No, I have to go.

255
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
It'll be fun if you can't make one.

256
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
There are eggs.

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,520
Really?

258
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
I bought eggs

259
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
It's too thick actually.

260
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
I found it.

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Right?

262
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,600
It's okay.

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
This is our first time.

264
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,520
Here.

265
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,320
Pour it on me.

266
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,240
It said pouring a spoon.

267
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,880
I don't know how much a spoon is.

268
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,280
You say stop.

269
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,160
It's okay.

270
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
There's no need for too much sugar.

271
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,560
So much.

272
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,840
OK. Come on.

273
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,760
I'll cook it.

274
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,560
This dish has become yours.

275
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
End the rest.

276
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,840
It's almost done.

277
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,800
Put the chili down a little.

278
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
Fried an egg.

279
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Two lucky eggs.

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
Whoever gets it will get it.

281
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,640
and put the eggs there.

282
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,840
You have this skill?

283
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,720
He did it. He did it.

284
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
No.

285
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
You've improved a bit.

286
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
You left me behind.

287
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,680
No, Xiao Ling did it.

288
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,560
Your sister is the best.

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,960
The sky has collapsed.

290
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,040
Let's talk at home.

291
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,960
I heard you're cooking in the show.

292
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,640
Make me one

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
I said I'll fry the eggs.

294
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,480
Xiao Ling said, stir-fried pork with chili.

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
Tom, do you need any help?

296
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Help me here.

297
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,680
I'll cheer for you.

298
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,160
Okay.

299
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,000
Put pressure on me.

300
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Put pressure on me.

301
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,520
The soup is so bright now.

302
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,640
After having love,

303
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,680
he and Xiaoling have changed a lot.

304
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,880
Draw it from here.

305
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,440
Come on.

306
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,760
Okay.

307
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
Fatty taught me new Cantonese.

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,880
Two spoons of soy sauce and one spoon of vinegar.

309
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Can I put it now?

310
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Okay, that's enough

311
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
I made a big portion.

312
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,160
Fried eggs with ham sausage.

313
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
Stewed ribs with potatoes.

314
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,800
Stewed ribs with potatoes

315
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,320
Stewed ribs with potatoes.

316
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,800
I think this dish is too big.

317
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,920
Have some.

318
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Try the poison?

319
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Try it.

320
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
It's actually something I don't like.

321
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,080
And it's muddy again.

322
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,320
Eggplant with cold sauce.

323
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Do you think it's okay

324
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
Isn't it amazing?

325
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
Fried pork with chili.

326
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Is it done

327
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll serve it if it's done.

328
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,280
Whose crab is this?

329
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Did you make this

330
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
So awesome.

331
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
Tae-seo can do this.

332
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
And lobsters.

333
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
You spent a lot today.

334
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,400
Magic.

335
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,720
Terri lost himself

336
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,160
(Tae-seo lost himself.)

337
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
Fall in!

338
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,640
Come on.

339
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,360
Three, two, one.

340
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
I love this atmosphere

341
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
It feels like the first day, my family

342
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,080
This is our first meal

343
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,840
Come on

344
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,760
Let me do it.

345
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,200
No, three, two.

346
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,040
Turn your nose to the left.

347
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Su Zihao said you were like a straight stone.

348
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,880
like a straight stone.

349
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Like this.

350
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,760
Seriously?

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,520
It's me. I'm scared.

352
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,240
I will cry.

353
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,880
Yes, I'll be scared to death.

354
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
If you scream, don't you scream?

355
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
No, I thought my nose was broken.

356
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,040
I dare not move.

357
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
Because there's only one nose

358
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
only one nose.

359
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
Because my nose is too high.

360
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,320
I slept

361
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,880
I jumped up from the bed.

362
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
I sat on the bed while sleeping.

363
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
I found myself naked.

364
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,400
I put my clothes on.

365
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,120
You even wore the clothes upside down at night, you know?

366
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
I strangled you all night.

367
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,640
Why do I feel like someone is strangling me when I sleep?

368
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,200
He doesn't scream or cry.

369
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
He's not noisy.

370
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,400
What do you think?

371
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Not bad.

372
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,560
You don't want it?

373
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Yes, thank you.

374
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,400
Why are you eating something without meat?

375
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,120
This is for you.

376
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,400
Give me those without meat.

377
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,840
Okay.

378
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
I support Susu.

379
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,960
Is this delicious?

380
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,680
It's delicious.

381
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
I can feel Terri's chef (cooking).

382
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,720
Try Xin's.

383
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,640
tender beef.

384
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
Chili is also delicious

385
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
The meat is delicious too

386
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
The fried pork with chili is really delicious.

387
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,520
I think so too.

388
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,200
Really?

389
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,720
Really

390
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
And chili is delicious

391
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,200
It's my first time cooking

392
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
It's so delicious.

393
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
It's my first time eating Xiaoling's cooking.

394
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
Me too.

395
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Cherish this last meal.

396
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
The last dinner.

397
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,960
That's sad.

398
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't say that.

399
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,880
They'll be sad.

400
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
I can only say

401
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,520
I didn't get along well enough.

402
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
I hate to part with you.

403
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
I hate parting.

404
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
I think this is cruel.

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
But it's also very realistic.

406
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm quite used to

407
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,320
the life we live together every day.

408
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,440
Time really flies.

409
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
In the past two days,

410
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,400
I gradually realized that I'm leaving.

411
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,720
I don't want to leave.

412
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
There's a text.

413
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Text?

414
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,960
Tomorrow is the confession day.

415
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
Please respond to your feelings.

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840
A, become a couple with him.

417
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
B is still hesitating.

418
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
We've confirmed our relationship.

419
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,320
What do you mean?

420
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
Pick one between A and B.

421
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,280
There are four couples with him.

422
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,320
Six are still hesitating.

423
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Only four.

424
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,480
What do you mean?

425
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
There are four of us.

426
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,080
I've decided to become a couple.

427
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,640
Six say I'm still hesitating.

428
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
My teammates think

429
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,040
choose

430
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,400
who will be the couple?

431
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
Soup, Susu.

432
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,640
Tata Harry.

433
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes.

434
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,560
Everyone else is hesitating.

435
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,520
Tae-seo is also hesitating.

436
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,560
But Tae-seo and Hwa-hwa

437
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
just got together.

438
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,280
This is too fast.

439
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,440
Yes.

440
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,760
Xiaoling's hesitation should be

441
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,440
if the map really likes her.

442
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,080
Yes.

443
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,840
Go alone.

444
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,360
I'll go then.

445
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,160
Go ahead.

446
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
Here comes the mission card again.

447
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Last mission.

448
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,440
(To members of the house.)

449
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
Before the confession,

450
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,280
to make everyone

451
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
their feelings better.

452
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,680
Next, we'll talk about the truth.

453
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,760
Talk about your partner with your brother.

454
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
I'll ask him a question instead of my brother.

455
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,800
The questions are not allowed.

456
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,360
There are four people who want to be a couple

457
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
They want to be a couple.

458
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,880
Six people are still considering the final choice.

459
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm telling you the truth.

460
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,880
It's different from the last heart-to-heart party.

461
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Although it's a brother question,

462
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
but they ask what I want to say.

463
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,640
Just ask them for me.

464
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,400
Yes, they're shy to ask.

465
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,760
It's open.

466
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
It should be cruel this time.

467
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
The court will be here soon.

468
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,320
Let me tell you.

469
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
This must be the court.

470
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,160
Looking forward to Su Zihao.

471
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,440
ask some questions

472
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,840
that I'm too shy to ask.

473
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,280
Are you afraid I'll ask you?

474
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
No.

475
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,280
Really?

476
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,240
Go ahead.

477
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,400
Is there anything else you want to ask?

478
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm thinking. Wait.

479
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,040
Ask him for me.

480
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,760
Send it to me.

481
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
I thought about something.

482
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,319
Do you want me to ask?

483
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,079
I actually think

484
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,240
you don't want to give a grade.

485
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,760
That would be awkward.

486
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,800
Lower.

487
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay.

488
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,400
No, no.

489
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,040
Ask Xiao Ling first.

490
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Okay.

491
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,680
Okay, edit the memo.

492
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,000
If you have any questions,

493
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
you can tell me.

494
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,920
I have no questions.

495
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,760
So you have questions?

496
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,040
No, I want to ask all of them.

497
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,880
I want to ask all of them.

498
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Just one.

499
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,400
Sit here.

500
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Let me show you my question.

501
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,080
Which one do you want to ask?

502
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,760
I think this is OK.

503
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
You can ask.

504
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,480
Let's start.

505
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,280
Okay, I'll ask first.

506
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
Mr. Tang is the first again.

507
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880
Mr. Tang, you're awesome.

508
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
Quiet.

509
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,680
The map must be panicking now.

510
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,080
Well,

511
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
Tu Tu, you went on a date

512
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,680
with my sister today.

513
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,960
Actually,

514
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
it's more peaceful.

515
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,560
Are you one of the four

516
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,680
or among the six?

517
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
Among the six,

518
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,640
both of us think

519
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,560
I think confessing and being together

520
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
to face.

521
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
We can't

522
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
because we haven't confirmed our feelings.

523
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
But as time covers us,

524
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,280
let's confess our love.

525
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I think

526
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,520
doesn't fit our feelings.

527
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,040
Because we both chose

528
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,160
love each other for a long time.

529
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,680
Since we have

530
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,400
the cuteness of emotions,

531
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
I think it's moving towards the right direction.

532
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not about sprouting.

533
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
you have to say

534
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,360
to make a fruit.

535
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes.

536
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay.

537
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,440
Among your relationship with Xiaoling,

538
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
what's your biggest concern now?

539
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,080
Good question.

540
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,400
The soup is really good.

541
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
I think my concern is

542
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
is distance.

543
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
and some things

544
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
we need to face.

545
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,680
I have two years to graduate.

546
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,400
She will graduate in two years.

547
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,440
So during this period,

548
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
we can't change our position

549
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,800
to change our position.

550
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
Only one can be in Hangzhou,

551
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
and the other in Beijing.

552
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,720
I think this is

553
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,120
my biggest concern.

554
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
I'll leave a question for you.

555
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,520
Okay, next.

556
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,880
You have another question.

557
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,680
You're blushing.

558
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,960
Like sitting on a needle.

559
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
Let me ask.

560
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,680
Let's change seats.

561
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,080
No.

562
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,160
I thought you had imagined the future

563
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,880
you had already imagined the future.

564
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,600
Do you think the future

565
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
are you just joking

566
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,840
or are you confident

567
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
you two will have this future.

568
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,240
So sharp.

569
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,680
I'm trying to

570
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,040
long-term things.

571
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,520
I can't see the effect for the time being.

572
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
or make money.

573
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,120
I don't like it either.

574
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,960
Because I ask my family for money when I'm in a relationship.

575
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,840
I think

576
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,040
Susu and I have no such concerns.

577
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,400
Because what Susu values

578
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
is the sincerity,

579
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,560
instead of

580
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,880
the value of money.

581
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
I think

582
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,280
I can stick to

583
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
for a long time.

584
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
and love at the same time.

585
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,600
So this is your confidence.

586
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
that you two will have this future?

587
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,080
Yes.

588
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
Do you think this is enough?

589
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
It seems too sharp.

590
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm looking for trouble.

591
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
What do you want

592
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,520
to be confident?

593
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
I think

594
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
It means

595
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,600
There are many girls who don't need to spend their money.

596
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
Then why is it her?

597
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
I like her.

598
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,160
My first reaction wasn't very happy.

599
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,120
But I thought it over.

600
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,240
As Su's brother,

601
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,760
he hopes his brother

602
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,080
the best.

603
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,240
What do you think

604
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,800
what else is the percentage of others?

605
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,040
What about my sister's percentage?

606
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,840
I think

607
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,560
80 percent.

608
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
or 30 percent.

609
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
Because I...

610
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm quite casual.

611
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,520
I can do anything.

612
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,440
I can't eat spicy food.

613
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
it's very compulsive.

614
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,080
But I remember

615
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
I remember whether you quarreled

616
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
or stubborn,

617
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,120
You rejected my sister twice.

618
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,880
She wants to talk to you.

619
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
It's not obvious.

620
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
Isn't it 80 percent?

621
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
70 percent?

622
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,160
It's like 60 percent.

623
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,840
40 percent.

624
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,280
I was crying.

625
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
What a sincere answer.

626
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,160
The reason is

627
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
Well,

628
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
Because I hate

629
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,760
chatting and angry.

630
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
So I promise I won't say anything

631
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,280
when I talk.

632
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,680
In that situation,

633
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,720
I was afraid I would say something that would hurt her.

634
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
So I chose...

635
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
I said let's talk tomorrow.

636
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,120
This is right.

637
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,000
Because I saw his eyes red.

638
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,520
I thought he was crying.

639
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,240
But he was stubborn.

640
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,320
He said he didn't cry.

641
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,920
I didn't expect

642
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,520
I was disturbing him when he was crying.

643
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Okay, next question.

644
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,520
If my sister wasn't the first one to come in,

645
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
there's no room for you two to be alone.

646
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
You'll like the first one to come in.

647
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,480
who came in first?

648
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,600
No.

649
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,160
If a

650
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
a very cool girl,

651
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
Do you like that cool girl

652
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,680
or my sister whom I first met?

653
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,280
Susu.

654
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,160
Why?

655
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm already in love.

656
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
This is good.

657
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,360
It's so sweet.

658
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,840
Sincerity is the ultimate move.

659
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
There are so many hypotheses.

660
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm very shy.

661
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
and sorry.

662
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,120
It's a bit too straightforward.

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,800
This sentence makes me feel

664
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,520
improved.

665
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,600
I've expressed my love

666
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,920
in front of others.

667
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,240
Maybe he wants to prove himself to me.

668
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,320
I think when I love someone,

669
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,680
When I want to get close to her,

670
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,480
to break through

671
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
and do what I've never done.

672
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
But in this relationship,

673
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
Susu has also made a lot of efforts.

674
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes.

675
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,240
She's been guiding the soup.

676
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay, I...

677
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,560
Are you ready?

678
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,120
Tata, sit over there.

679
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,720
You like him

680
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,440
just because he's considerate to you?

681
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,960
If someone else

682
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,760
does everything to you,

683
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
you will still like him, right?

684
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,840
Their questions are the same logic.

685
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
It's really the same.

686
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,240
It's a sharp question.

687
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
Let me think about it.

688
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,920
I only got in touch with Harry.

689
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,040
At first,

690
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,440
with Harry at first.

691
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,200
And I chose him.

692
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,440
After that,

693
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,200
he did these things to me,

694
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,240
he was really touched.

695
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,400
And in the beginning,

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
I was interested in him.

697
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,960
So...

698
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,600
Do you think you'll regret

699
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
because you regret not meeting others?

700
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
I don't regret it now.

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,240
Happy.

702
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,880
I'm so happy.

703
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,200
About the situation of a foreign relationship,

704
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,920
Su Zihao has been trying to solve it.

705
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
What do you think?

706
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,080
How long are you going to see him?

707
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I think we should meet every month.

708
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Really?

709
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,480
That is...

710
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,280
See you.

711
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,560
I feel like I have to see him every month.

712
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,760
and every month

713
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,440
or every month.

714
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,920
It's not the time for you to ask questions.

715
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
Who asked?

716
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,800
He was in a hurry.

717
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,600
To be exact,

718
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,440
He cares about this.

719
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,120
Yes.

720
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
How do you solve

721
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
the problem of meeting?

722
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,720
Because he has to go to school and you have to work.

723
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,560
And...

724
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,760
Tokyo to London

725
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
13 or 14 hours.

726
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,640
13 hours and 25 minutes.

727
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
I said we should meet every month.

728
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,280
the hardship I have to overcome

729
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,480
is the three months approaching.

730
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,960
to overcome these three months.

731
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
Because I just signed a contract with the company,

732
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
I might not be able to leave.

733
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,880
If

734
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,120
I don't have a job,

735
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
I can apply for leave in advance.

736
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,960
Like this.

737
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
If I can leave, I will leave.

738
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,920
It's true that my work

739
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,560
is very unstable.

740
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,280
I may think about

741
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,200
my career and work first.

742
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes, because Su Zihao is in school.

743
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
he must have no way

744
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
he can't fly

745
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,240
fly to other places.

746
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,200
So I don't think

747
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
he can fly to another country

748
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,640
he can fly to another country.

749
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,960
And it's not a few hours.

750
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,000
It's more than ten hours.

751
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes.

752
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,680
I can only do my best

753
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,080
to balance this problem.

754
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm sure

755
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,720
we'll discuss it later.

756
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,120
I...

757
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,600
If we didn't meet for a month,

758
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,320
I think it's acceptable.

759
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,680
I thought Susu was really

760
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,040
on the opposite side.

761
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,120
She is on Su Zihao's side.

762
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,360
Her desire and meeting

763
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,480
is more like what Su Zihao

764
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,720
before.

765
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,360
She probably said

766
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,840
she's afraid that I just want to go.

767
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,960
but I can't.

768
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,320
It makes Su Zihao feel insecure.

769
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,040
Everyone has reality problems.

770
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Yes.

771
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm not satisfied with her answer.

772
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,720
I know she can't be sure about this.

773
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,160
It's like drawing "pancake".

774
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,240
I hope this pastry

775
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,360
is the pastry that I can eat,

776
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
instead of "pancake" that doesn't exist.

777
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,840
Yes.

778
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,000
You can't just let him

779
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
give you this promise every month.

780
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,160
He needs a sense of security.

781
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Su Zihao needs a sense of security in a relationship.

782
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,040
How are you going to give him a sense of security?

783
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I see. He's super anxious.

784
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,960
He has no sense of security.

785
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,720
But I am

786
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,880
in a relationship,

787
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
in a relationship.

788
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
Actually, I can give

789
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,720
a lot of sense of security.

790
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,000
I just need to settle down with the other person.

791
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,120
Once I've made up my mind,

792
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,920
I trust him unconditionally.

793
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
What does he need

794
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,120
what does he need?

795
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,520
I'll ask him directly.

796
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,240
And

797
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,640
after knowing the solution he wants,

798
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,200
I'll try my best to satisfy him.

799
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
Okay, no problem.

800
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,600
Look.

801
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,320
So anxious.

802
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,360
Because they are

803
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,400
different.

804
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
Because the tower is a person

805
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
a sense of security.

806
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,040
So she may not understand this point.

807
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,880
People who lack sense of security

808
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,080
may sound like a "pancake".

809
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,160
They need a balance.

810
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,240
They have many real problems to face.

811
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,520
They even hope

812
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,000
to solve this problem.

813
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,280
Don't think about it too ideally.

814
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,360
Yes, they can adjust it slowly.

815
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,480
Now they want to say

816
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,400
My dream is to see each other every month.

817
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,520
But if it doesn't work,

818
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,320
they can gradually be together for two months and three months.

819
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
If they can overcome love,

820
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,560
they haven't found

821
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,240
the balance point.

822
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
I think Harry is still very active.

823
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,040
He's trying to solve it.

824
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,760
But he didn't seem to find a way.

825
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,240
This is a dead point.

826
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,840
The sharp Mi is online.

827
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,280
Are you four or six?

828
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
I'm four.

829
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,160
If

830
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,520
you have conflicts with the soup,

831
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
will you be angry?

832
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
Or do you

833
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,360
with him

834
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,480
with him.

835
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
I get angry.

836
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,560
So honest.

837
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,320
If you are

838
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,720
in a very contradictory situation,

839
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,440
After a while,

840
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,000
before I can solve the problem.

841
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,040
How long did you stay calm?

842
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,520
And your calmness means you don't text

843
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,320
or you don't want to meet him?

844
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,880
Or...

845
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,560
I think it depends on my mood.

846
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,880
I think if I don't text her,

847
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,400
it may last for a short time.

848
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,960
But if I'm

849
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,000
when I'm angry,

850
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,440
if you come to see me,

851
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,560
if you come to see me.

852
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
Because I'm soft-hearted.

853
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,120
I can't

854
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,560
to see me alone.

855
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,120
to see me.

856
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,200
And I just don't want to see him.

857
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,560
I can't do such a thing.

858
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
Okay.

859
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
Xiao Ling asked Susu because I asked her to.

860
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,880
I was afraid that I would hear

861
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,320
I don't want to hear.

862
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,440
In your opinion,

863
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
both parties are equal in love?

864
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,040
Or do you think

865
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,760
girls need to enjoy

866
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,480
being favored.

867
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,640
I want to put the ugliest words

868
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,320
and the most difficult problem

869
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,640
to solve.

870
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
And I think

871
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
I think it's better to walk.

872
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,800
I definitely hope to be loved more.

873
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,800
Yes.

874
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
But I think

875
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,320
51%.

876
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay.

877
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,560
Okay.

878
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,040
Got it.

879
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
I think girls

880
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
want more preference.

881
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,160
I think this is what every girl

882
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,320
all girls want.

883
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,280
Loving me a little more

884
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,840
to love me a little more.

885
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,520
She thinks boys need to pay more attention.

886
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,440
But she can be

887
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,120
51%.

888
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,080
She is 49 percent.

889
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,680
Actually, I'm quite satisfied.

890
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm happy to hear this answer.

891
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,720
That's all.

892
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
You scared me.

893
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
Okay.

894
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
I have a question for Hua.

895
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Do you think

896
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,440
our friendship

897
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,560
change our friendship

898
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,040
because of fat?

899
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
I think you are influenced.

900
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm not.

901
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay.

902
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,880
I think I'm fine.

903
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,080
I care about this.

904
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,760
I think we can

905
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,480
we can

906
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,320
talk alone after this.

907
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,200
Because we didn't

908
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,080
serious

909
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,800
Sit down and have a chat.

910
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,680
Yes, just talk to her.

911
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,640
She might think I might have neglected her.

912
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,440
or I wasn't very enthusiastic to her.

913
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,120
She thought maybe I was influenced.

914
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,280
So I thought

915
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,360
I might

916
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,320
talk to her again today.

917
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,280
Actually, my question is very simple.

918
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,680
But this question

919
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,320
I want to ask you why you sent it to Xinxin.

920
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
why you sent it to Xinxin.

921
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,880
Because that text message was after going back to the room.

922
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
And I think

923
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,200
with Esther.

924
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,800
We had more interactions.

925
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,360
And at that time,

926
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,040
send the message to Xinxin.

927
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,800
But I didn't know.

928
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,360
And I didn't know until very last.

929
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
I never knew.

930
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,640
this message

931
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,160
caused a misunderstanding to Xinxin.

932
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,360
Because she thought it was from Harry.

933
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,600
I don't have any other questions.

934
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,360
You first, I first.

935
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll go first.

936
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,360
I'll ask some questions for Tae-seo.

937
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Sure.

938
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,280
Go ahead.

939
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,280
If Tae-seo had been in the house from the beginning,

940
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,600
would you choose Tae-seo more firmly?

941
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,880
If I didn't

942
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
he wouldn't have...

943
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,560
He's not someone you fell in love with at first sight.

944
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,520
Not me?

945
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Who is it?

946
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,120
You.

947
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,920
Yes.

948
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,560
I may have the order.

949
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,280
is not very important.

950
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,480
It should be important to Flower.

951
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,200
Because Hua was fat at the beginning.

952
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,760
If

953
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,680
to show up at the same time as them,

954
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,040
maybe she just wants to know me.

955
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,840
After meeting Tae-seo,

956
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,400
has Tae-seo always been your best choice?

957
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,160
Not always.

958
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,560
Tae-seo was too nervous to raise his head.

959
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,120
Are you still shaking?

960
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,240
your own choice and feelings?

961
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,520
No.

962
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,120
I prepared a question in advance.

963
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,680
to ask Hua for me.

964
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,400
And Tata's brother

965
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
has some questions for Harry.

966
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
So I pretend to be

967
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
Lingkai (Tata's brother).

968
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,960
Okay.

969
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,960
Are you ready?

970
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,120
Revenge for me too.

971
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,680
If the problem is not sharp,

972
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,360
use your tone to scare him.

973
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,480
Your tone.

974
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,800
When you contact the tower,

975
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,520
did you regret

976
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,320
what you did in the house?

977
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,440
I regret being angry with her.

978
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,760
What do you mean?

979
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,440
I was angry with her at the ball.

980
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,920
Later,

981
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,200
she said something that made me angry.

982
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,240
I get angry with her too.

983
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,040
Are you satisfied, my sister?

984
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,960
These answers...

985
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,200
I'll keep asking him if he's not satisfied.

986
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,800
Then you continue.

987
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,240
For example,

988
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,040
you regret your quarrel with Tata.

989
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,600
Have you ever thought about what to do next?

990
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,920
to make it happen

991
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,880
and not regret it?

992
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,560
It's not my fault.

993
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,800
It's not my fault.

994
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,440
I didn't quarrel with her.

995
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
I just didn't want to talk to her.

996
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,360
It wasn't my fault,

997
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,640
but it could be my fault

998
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,480
it could be my problem.

999
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
I didn't expect him to say that.

1000
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,400
He stressed that

1001
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,880
Although it's not his fault,

1002
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,960
I feel like you're pushing me to the edge of the wind.

1003
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,040
Maybe I thought too much.

1004
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,160
But I was shocked when I heard it.

1005
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,080
So, have you ever regretted

1006
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
about your regret?

1007
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
Of course.

1008
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Show us.

1009
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,280
Since she told me

1010
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,600
I texted her officially.

1011
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
I sent her

1012
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,520
I sent it to her every night.

1013
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,679
the night before

1014
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,000
or the next morning.

1015
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,440
After you edit the text,

1016
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll sit down

1017
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,719
I'll sit down

1018
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,840
and edit the texts from this day.

1019
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,360
That's why I texted her every day.

1020
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,239
every day.

1021
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,080
Or like this. A lot.

1022
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,280
The last question.

1023
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,480
Play Suzu's voice.

1024
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,840
Just release it.

1025
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,000
Speaker on.

1026
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,719
Because most of your time

1027
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,320
in the show.

1028
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,360
How long do you think

1029
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,960
for Tata?

1030
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,760
I think my passion for Tata

1031
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,480
for Tata.

1032
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
I think as long as we are together,

1033
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,560
my passion will never fade.

1034
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,719
Because if my passion fades,

1035
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,560
we won't be together.

1036
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,719
How can you guarantee that?

1037
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,040
Two people who like each other

1038
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,320
The topic will never end.

1039
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,840
The weather is different every day.

1040
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,480
I think we talk about different things every day

1041
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,960
and share different things.

1042
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,320
This passion will always

1043
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,520
When you have nothing to say,

1044
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,960
when you have nothing to say.

1045
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
When it comes to action,

1046
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,720
we go on a trip.

1047
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,360
So many countries

1048
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,080
and so many cities.

1049
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,720
Right?

1050
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,200
I'll just...

1051
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
I just follow her.

1052
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes.

1053
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,960
He's an idealist.

1054
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
He thinks love can overcome everything.

1055
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,040
But

1056
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,360
at the beginning,

1057
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,120
I think

1058
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,800
there must be a problem between them.

1059
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't know

1060
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,080
whether this problem can be solved.

1061
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,120
So I think I can't say

1062
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,800
this love can overcome everything.

1063
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,240
Are you satisfied?

1064
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Yes.

1065
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Satisfied?

1066
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,840
Okay, go ahead.

1067
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,600
I want to ask Xiao Ling.

1068
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,200
Here, I'll take a seat.

1069
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,200
I know your family through the video.

1070
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,120
You're a great family.

1071
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,000
Maybe the map

1072
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,640
is excellent in my heart,

1073
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,320
compared to you,

1074
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,760
compared to you.

1075
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Do you mind

1076
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,440
a match?

1077
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I don't mind.

1078
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,600
Not at all.

1079
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
Will your thoughts

1080
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
change according to your family?

1081
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,520
The relationship I had before

1082
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,000
I didn't tell my mom.

1083
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,200
But she guessed it.

1084
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,080
She doesn't want me to be with her.

1085
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,920
But in my own relationship,

1086
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,000
in my own relationship.

1087
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,040
Actually,

1088
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
this question before,

1089
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,320
but in my heart,

1090
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,120
a big

1091
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,280
that bothers me.

1092
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
In my heart, I think

1093
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,240
a good relationship

1094
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,720
needs a lot of support.

1095
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,280
In fact, it's more about family.

1096
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,920
Later, she firmly

1097
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,040
she said

1098
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,800
she will firmly choose what she likes.

1099
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,720
I'm very touched now.

1100
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,480
In your industry,

1101
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,160
in your industry.

1102
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,640
Yes.

1103
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
Because both of you

1104
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320
Do you think

1105
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,080
who can stand temptation?

1106
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,920
I think

1107
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm really capable.

1108
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,520
Very capable.

1109
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,200
You're a very loyal person.

1110
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,040
My friends scold me when I'm single-minded.

1111
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,840
You're a love lover.

1112
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm usually quite sober.

1113
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,440
But if I really fall in love with someone,

1114
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,000
I am...

1115
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,720
To put it bluntly, it's like

1116
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
a very romantic person.

1117
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,720
For example, he's in Hangzhou.

1118
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,200
If I really date him,

1119
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,000
I would say I would want to move to Hangzhou.

1120
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,960
That's what I thought.

1121
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,120
No.

1122
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,000
Actually, I think the same way as her.

1123
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,360
Because in fact,

1124
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,880
if I really fall in

1125
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,400
in a relationship,

1126
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
I'm definitely a very romantic person.

1127
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,360
I will express my feelings to her every day.

1128
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,200
So,

1129
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,800
as for the future arrangement,

1130
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,440
will definitely approach her.

1131
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,560
I know

1132
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,120
you always like

1133
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,680
a little older than you.

1134
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
He's not a person

1135
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,080
who can take care of others.

1136
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,000
I think

1137
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,720
To be honest, I don't need others to take care of me.

1138
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,400
I think I'm quite independent

1139
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,360
I'm quite independent.

1140
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,120
I may need someone

1141
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,480
I need someone to take care of me.

1142
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,840
Life or

1143
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,880
handling things,

1144
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't need others to take care of me.

1145
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,880
I think you are all good.

1146
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Then why are you one of

1147
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,040
one of them?

1148
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,160
If I get into a relationship,

1149
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,280
I will

1150
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,000
think a lot.

1151
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,840
And I'm very romantic.

1152
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,000
I didn't feel

1153
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,280
I would be chosen firmly,

1154
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,920
I dare not take a step forward.

1155
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,920
Very...

1156
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,680
Good job.

1157
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,160
A sincere answer.

1158
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,800
I feel relieved.

1159
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
Actually, Xiao Ling is already very active.

1160
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,080
Her subtitles are

1161
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,720
I can solve your concerns.

1162
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,200
As long as you choose me firmly,

1163
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,680
Yes.

1164
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,640
That's what I need.

1165
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,240
And you were telling me

1166
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,040
I'll always come to her.

1167
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
At this moment,

1168
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,000
you didn't make me feel

1169
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,240
you're firmly choosing me.

1170
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
What Xiaoling said today

1171
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,000
I actually don't like it.

1172
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,800
It's annoying.

1173
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,760
I'm angry.

1174
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,880
Because I think

1175
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,840
you've done a lot

1176
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,240
for someone unworthy.

1177
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,360
is a bad thing.

1178
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I want to tell you

1179
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,680
you are excellent.

1180
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,360
You deserve to be loved.

1181
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,200
You don't have to

1182
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,120
take care of others' emotions.

1183
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
There's a brother intervention.

1184
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,880
I feel sorry for his sister.

1185
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,600
Got it. I'm done.

1186
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,960
It's my turn.

1187
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm already scared.

1188
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,120
First of all,

1189
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,880
You said you wanted to

1190
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
in a relationship.

1191
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,960
How far do you think

1192
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,440
have you observed?

1193
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,000
If the progress is 100 percent,

1194
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,880
I think

1195
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
70 to 80 percent.

1196
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,520
This area

1197
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
you told me

1198
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,480
you are the one

1199
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,800
in a relationship.

1200
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,200
Do you mind long-distance relationship?

1201
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,680
A long-distance relationship

1202
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,240
doesn't exist.

1203
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,320
I can fly there

1204
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,760
I can even fly there.

1205
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,360
It's right here.

1206
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
There's no long-distance relationship in a relationship.

1207
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,840
Whether it's my job

1208
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,560
my income

1209
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I think it can support

1210
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,800
to live in her city.

1211
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,360
So bossy.

1212
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,240
This is the real boss.

1213
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,840
I don't care.

1214
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,960
I just came.

1215
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,000
You came directly.

1216
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,320
I'll pick you up.

1217
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,920
I think

1218
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,960
I think Tae-seo is great.

1219
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,600
I feel so secure.

1220
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,440
Yes.

1221
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,680
Good man.

1222
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,080
Awesome.

1223
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,120
And this is what Hua likes.

1224
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,840
A firm choice.

1225
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,240
Yes.

1226
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,680
Perfect devotion and preference.

1227
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,560
Think about

1228
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,280
which moment it made you decide

1229
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
you won't let anyone else know about it.

1230
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm sure it's Hua.

1231
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,400
I remember it clearly.

1232
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
It should be the moment

1233
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,120
when I took photos for her.

1234
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,680
she was really cute in the camera.

1235
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Actually, I've already decided on her feelings.

1236
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,280
Okay.

1237
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,360
I left a question.

1238
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,640
Okay.

1239
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,200
Here comes the sharpest question.

1240
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,680
You said you were sincere.

1241
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,400
After you failed to go on a date with Tata,

1242
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,120
you immediately went on a date with Xiaoling

1243
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,640
and asked Xiao Ling.

1244
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Are you happy that I got interviewed?

1245
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,920
What's your definition of sincerity?

1246
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,040
like two people at the same time?

1247
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,400
Tata's face.

1248
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
He's already warm.

1249
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,400
Or was he lying to Xiaoling?

1250
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,680
I think...

1251
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,240
Why?

1252
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,360
Actually, Xiao Ling asked me

1253
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,080
this question.

1254
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
It's not something

1255
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,200
to hide.

1256
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,680
But it can't be that

1257
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,480
I'll tell her directly.

1258
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,760
When I first met her,

1259
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,680
I was the second one.

1260
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,640
That's it.

1261
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,320
It's an awkward question.

1262
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,480
Because at that time,

1263
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,280
in the process.

1264
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,920
It doesn't mean

1265
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,200
I like two people at the same time.

1266
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,720
I think

1267
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,440
It's more possible.

1268
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:34,840
Back then,

1269
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,480
I went to the interview first.

1270
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,400
Because I think

1271
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
that day,

1272
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,280
Tata and I were ice and snow exercises.

1273
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
I get along with her the most.

1274
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,560
So I might want to know her first.

1275
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,560
Why did you

1276
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,280
send a message to Xiaoling that day?

1277
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,440
Because after that day,

1278
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,600
we were always together

1279
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,920
we're always together.

1280
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,000
At that time, I thought

1281
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,120
my feelings

1282
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,360
I want to know more about this side.

1283
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,280
I asked you yesterday

1284
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,400
Are you sure about your feelings?

1285
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
Your answer is never there.

1286
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,360
Since you're not sure about your feelings,

1287
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,320
you've been

1288
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,280
giving the signal to Xiaoling.

1289
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,320
Are you looking for a way out for yourself?

1290
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,840
Go straight.

1291
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
Mr. Tang, good.

1292
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,880
I mean,

1293
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,200
whether I should

1294
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,400
with her.

1295
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,720
She might think

1296
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,640
my feelings for her and someone else.

1297
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,680
But that's not true.

1298
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
Because after that day,

1299
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,440
after we texted each other,

1300
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,280
all the (feelings) texts and all

1301
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,600
The person I went to know was Xiaoling.

1302
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,880
No one else showed up.

1303
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,160
came out halfway.

1304
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,000
Yes.

1305
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,480
This is how I feel.

1306
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,600
Okay.

1307
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,040
This answer seems to be

1308
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,320
When asking questions about the map,

1309
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,640
there are similar answers.

1310
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,760
I feel like

1311
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,560
a function of golden oil.

1312
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,640
Standard answer.

1313
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,760
So smart.

1314
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,640
It's over.

1315
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,600
That's all.

1316
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,760
Okay, it's over.

1317
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,560
Is there any problem

1318
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,680
before confirming the relationship?

1319
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,600
Although it's sharp,

1320
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,760
but we need to talk about something.

1321
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,120
I have to ask them if they like me.

1322
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,400
It's not sharp.

1323
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,920
Is there anyone else outside?

1324
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
Are you involved in gambling and drugs?

1325
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,240
As long as you don't have it,

1326
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,360
I think it's fine.

1327
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
It depends.

1328
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,400
I think it's sharp.

1329
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,520
I'll ask them about their income.

1330
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,720
I think the view of money

1331
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,160
a very important part.

1332
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,360
This is a very realistic problem.

1333
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,040
In a certain way,

1334
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,880
your way of getting along

1335
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,680
and your

1336
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,240
your lifestyle

1337
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,000
determines the future.

1338
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,440
the foundation of your family.

1339
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,480
which determines

1340
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,800
for the future.

1341
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes.

1342
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,440
If we don't talk about stability,

1343
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,400
it's hard to build

1344
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,760
It's hard to build it stably.

1345
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
But this is a relationship for marriage.

1346
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,960
But you said

1347
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,320
Dating without marriage

1348
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,440
They're all bullies.

1349
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,760
When they're flirting,

1350
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,680
They're very sensitive.

1351
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,320
Yes, it may be stressful.

1352
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,400
Then I'll confirm my relationship with you.

1353
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,120
From this moment on,

1354
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
we are bound together.

1355
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,800
But it may not mean

1356
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,160
we must get married.

1357
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Maybe we have more responsibility.

1358
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,600
So I think if I ask about the property,

1359
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,120
will he think you're testing me?

1360
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,560
Yes. Don't ask at the beginning.

1361
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,320
Yes.

1362
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,640
What about health?

1363
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,080
Is cholesterol too high?

1364
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,200
Like me.

1365
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,880
A friend of mine

1366
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,000
before she fell in love.

1367
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,880
Dating and checkup reports.

1368
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,920
Very serious.

1369
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,680
But the problem is

1370
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,840
if you are really careless,

1371
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,480
he has some medical history

1372
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,880
or genetic history.

1373
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,040
What if

1374
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,720
you're about to

1375
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,520
to face this problem

1376
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,160
to face this problem.

1377
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,120
I think this is a big test.

1378
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,440
I think it's better

1379
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,320
it would be better.

1380
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,600
For example, both sides agree

1381
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,960
we tell each other the income.

1382
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,800
We both agree.

1383
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Let's go for a checkup.

1384
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,920
and give each other

1385
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,560
to each other.

1386
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:40,920
Right?

1387
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,800
It's a combination of both sides.

1388
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,160
After experiencing the truth,

1389
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,560
do you think the ratio of 46

1390
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,320
change?

1391
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,680
Teresa flower will come up.

1392
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,600
Take your notebook.

1393
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,200
A notebook?

1394
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,520
You want to see my album?

1395
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,880
Yes, I haven't.

1396
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
No one has seen mine.

1397
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,640
Have you seen mine?

1398
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,600
I didn't.

1399
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,320
Let me see it again.

1400
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,480
No problem.

1401
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,400
Because there's only one day left

1402
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,560
I only have one day left.

1403
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,320
I want to see her life album.

1404
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,400
And I want to know more about her.

1405
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Come on.

1406
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,080
Erlang's legs are stiff.

1407
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,600
Sister's new birth

1408
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,280
Yours is just born.

1409
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,400
Sister Hua.

1410
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
It's really big.

1411
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,920
How much?

1412
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,960
Seven catties.

1413
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,600
A little.

1414
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,600
You have big eyes.

1415
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,920
Joo-hae.

1416
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Let me see.

1417
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,680
No.

1418
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,560
I need to take a good look at this photo.

1419
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,120
I was in Zhuhai when I was three.

1420
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,800
You really...

1421
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
You really...

1422
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,080
I'm sorry.

1423
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,920
How old are you?

1424
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,880
Five or six years old.

1425
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,120
You had a lot of photos when you were young.

1426
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,920
They were all childhood.

1427
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,600
I said this when I was young.

1428
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,000
Is this the time to perform on stage?

1429
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,360
It's not good.

1430
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,000
I just want to see yours.

1431
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,200
Look at yours.

1432
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,920
They're starting to feel like a couple.

1433
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,240
You can ski, so...

1434
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,560
I skied in Shanghai.

1435
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,920
I think I only know

1436
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,240
in Shanghai.

1437
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,320
Yes this is indoor

1438
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,560
There seems to be one near my house.

1439
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,840
Drive for half an hour.

1440
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,640
A dozen kilometers.

1441
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,040
My friend asked me to go, so I didn't go.

1442
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,840
The snow field

1443
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,160
almost arrived in Suzhou.

1444
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,720
The one next to my house.

1445
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,160
Really?

1446
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,560
We've known each other since you came here last time.

1447
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,480
When did you go there? Tell me.

1448
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,760
November 1st.

1449
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,400
This year,

1450
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,440
I need to see this.

1451
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,520
What? You went there this year?

1452
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:39,920
No.

1453
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,720
Let me see.

1454
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,200
when my friend called me.

1455
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,480
Really?

1456
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,560
No way.

1457
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,800
November 27th, my friend called me.

1458
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,320
Okay.

1459
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,680
There are still 26 days difference.

1460
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,600
Look at yours.

1461
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,480
Mine is nothing to see.

1462
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,160
Let me see yours. Ugly.

1463
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,520
Look.

1464
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,320
No, I've always been pretty.

1465
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,960
I think so too.

1466
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,200
This is abroad.

1467
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,880
Yes, my sister is going to a show. I'm going to a show.

1468
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,960
Paris. This should be...

1469
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,080
Tell her to come tomorrow.

1470
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,320
What are you doing? I want to see my sister.

1471
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,920
Yes.

1472
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,480
What do you want to tell her when you see her?

1473
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Sister.

1474
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,840
Yuan Bo is really a good boy.

1475
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,920
He posts good people cards when he sees him.

1476
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,360
I think she will like flowers very much.

1477
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
Actually, I think

1478
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,120
will like her.

1479
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,240
After reading the colorful life album,

1480
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,280
I learned more about it.

1481
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,320
Because

1482
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,120
a chat party between Hua and me.

1483
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,840
After all,

1484
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,920
the last day in the house.

1485
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,760
I think we should take this opportunity

1486
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,120
to express

1487
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,160
in the past

1488
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,800
Tell me. Tell me.

1489
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,240
About the handwritten letter,

1490
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,440
I actually want to know

1491
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,800
what you wrote to Fatty.

1492
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,240
It's about...

1493
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,960
I think

1494
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,680
Tae-seo is good.

1495
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
I think he's good too.

1496
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,000
I may be hesitating.

1497
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,760
Which one of you

1498
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,800
I want to meet more.

1499
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,720
And

1500
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,680
I didn't write the content directly.

1501
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,160
I thought you might write it to me.

1502
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,760
I have a date with you.

1503
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,120
But if I write to him,

1504
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,240
I can talk to him

1505
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,960
have a chance

1506
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,440
to talk alone.

1507
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,000
But he rejected me in that letter.

1508
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,840
He probably

1509
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,640
doesn't want me to be with two people at the same time.

1510
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,280
So the next day,

1511
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,560
I went on a date with you.

1512
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,800
Back then, I was telling you

1513
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,160
I might have a date tonight.

1514
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,000
Yes, I know.

1515
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,120
But if you two

1516
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,320
write to each other,

1517
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,720
Is it because you two went on a date

1518
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,600
and the second time,

1519
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,320
we might not have this.

1520
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,720
I don't know.

1521
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,280
I think

1522
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,720
a little strange.

1523
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,760
It doesn't make sense logically.

1524
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,480
When you wrote a handwritten letter to him,

1525
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,880
he rejected you.

1526
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,640
right?

1527
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,200
But on the trip to Tianjin,

1528
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,640
I saw him

1529
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,760
I can see him anyway.

1530
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,840
to approach you.

1531
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,200
including seats.

1532
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,000
What do you think about this?

1533
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
After rejecting my handwritten letter,

1534
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,400
Didn't we talk on the second floor?

1535
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,640
And?

1536
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,360
He doesn't want me to chase you

1537
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,480
he was chasing me.

1538
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,920
It feels like we're on the same line.

1539
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,000
You run in the front.

1540
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,080
I'm in the middle.

1541
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,640
He wanted me to stop with him

1542
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,840
and let me get close to you.

1543
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,760
But last night,

1544
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,200
after you came back from the girls' party,

1545
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,720
I heard that

1546
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,680
you almost said

1547
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,560
you were going to marry Fatty right here.

1548
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,560
How did this come out?

1549
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,320
Marriage in place is a bit exaggerated.

1550
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,840
Fatty is wild in Guoli.

1551
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,280
Very mature.

1552
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,120
and mature.

1553
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,800
makes people feel at ease.

1554
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,400
I said the moment was touched.

1555
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,000
Got it.

1556
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,200
Actually, boys and girls all care about these.

1557
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,840
You were thinking about meeting two people.

1558
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,560
Aren't you afraid that I'll be unhappy?

1559
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
I explained it to you.

1560
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,480
So, including

1561
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,720
I texted you about my feelings.

1562
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,240
I also told you that

1563
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,360
I don't want

1564
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,240
between me and Fatty.

1565
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,760
happened to us.

1566
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,240
I don't think

1567
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,280
between us.

1568
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,360
He's afraid to miss it.

1569
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,720
he's afraid to be a backup.

1570
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,960
I can feel

1571
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,000
Why are you suddenly depressed?

1572
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,880
I don't know.

1573
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,160
I don't think you look happy.

1574
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,760
Then please comfort me.

1575
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,480
Comfort you?

1576
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
Did you do well?

1577
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,600
That's right.

1578
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,720
You're so handsome.

1579
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,040
Did you do your hair today?

1580
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,320
I do it every day.

1581
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,040
Why are you so handsome today?

1582
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,440
Your gray color suits you.

1583
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,160
Last second, I was still angry and unhappy.

1584
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,960
Then next second,

1585
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,200
how about she praise me in front of me?

1586
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,120
Maybe she's soft-hearted.

1587
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,160
So I was coaxed.

1588
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
I think

1589
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,360
the tacit understanding between Hua and me.

1590
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,480
Just coax her.

1591
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,960
It's too soft.

1592
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,840
What does she do?

1593
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,360
makes you feel dizzy.

1594
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,560
Let me give you an example.

1595
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,280
My last girlfriend.

1596
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,320
We were also abroad.

1597
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,400
When I got sick,

1598
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,000
Then she went to Shanghai to find me.

1599
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,560
and stayed with me for a week.

1600
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,760
There will be many things like this.

1601
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,600
Then I will gradually

1602
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,200
Right.

1603
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,960
Every part of my talk

1604
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,480
for a long time.

1605
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,760
before we got together.

1606
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,520
Have you ever thought

1607
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
your observation period

1608
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
because

1609
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,280
a girl before.

1610
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,520
At first sight,

1611
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,080
It's her.

1612
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,200
She's good at everything.

1613
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,840
Maybe

1614
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,840
this kind of situation.

1615
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,240
Because

1616
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
if I fall for a girl,

1617
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,840
I think you're so pretty.

1618
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,600
I might want to meet you

1619
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,680
and get to know you.

1620
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,200
But if I find out

1621
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,040
you have no feelings for me,

1622
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,560
Then...

1623
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Right?

1624
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,440
She likes you too.

1625
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,520
Will she still observe for that long?

1626
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,720
I already like it.

1627
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,640
I will also observe

1628
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,080
Although our living in a small house

1629
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,440
is accelerating.

1630
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,240
I told you before

1631
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,280
I said you got full marks.

1632
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,840
I'll give you seven to eight points now.

1633
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,000
In real life,

1634
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,160
in real life.

1635
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,520
Dream on. Seven to eight.

1636
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,320
He's very real.

1637
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,840
Yes.

1638
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,520
Thank you.

1639
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,120
Thank you.

1640
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,760
Yes.

1641
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,680
Yes.

1642
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,160
I mean it.

1643
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,680
But it's really suitable to get to know each other.

1644
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,400
We...

1645
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,240
Because I think

1646
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,280
I have many problems in dating.

1647
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,200
You seem to complement each other.

1648
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,560
I think

1649
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,160
you've been talking about

1650
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,440
your problem.

1651
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,320
Are you pushing me away?

1652
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,360
Yes.

1653
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,200
I'll try my best to tell you all my questions.

1654
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,120
Then I kept saying

1655
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,440
I have many problems.

1656
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,920
I was childish

1657
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,760
I was childish.

1658
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,520
It's indeed something

1659
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,880
when I'm in a relationship.

1660
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,280
When you're in a relationship,

1661
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,240
to be kids together.

1662
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,320
is to be childish.

1663
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,320
Yeah, didn't you say

1664
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,480
you would tolerate each other?

1665
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
I think I'm quite suitable for this.

1666
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,720
Your current state

1667
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,160
is already the state

1668
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,400
you won't respond so actively.

1669
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,360
You've made a breakthrough.

1670
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,520
Because of your job,

1671
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,800
that makes you feel

1672
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,840
you think there are many girls around me.

1673
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,720
So...

1674
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,400
Is that what you mean?

1675
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,560
No.

1676
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,440
Don't you feel touched by physical contact?

1677
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:06,800
No.

1678
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,440
How many years

1679
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,160
How many years is it now?

1680
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,760
Almost 11 years.

1681
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,720
There are too many physical contact for couples.

1682
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,800
They even have faces.

1683
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,640
A lot.

1684
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,000
After working together,

1685
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,920
after working together.

1686
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,200
Unless you often work together, right?

1687
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,760
For example, a brand often takes pictures of you two.

1688
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,040
We might get to know each other.

1689
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,160
But if only once in a while,

1690
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,400
I wouldn't even add you on WeChat.

1691
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,360
Tae-seo's answer is very sincere.

1692
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,600
It also gives her a sense of security.

1693
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,000
I didn't know until today

1694
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,920
you chose not to contact anyone

1695
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,240
when you took photos for me.

1696
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,880
So cute.

1697
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,600
Maybe it's because of my appearance.

1698
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,440
I'm pretty on the outside. Thank you.

1699
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,920
Can you change your pose?

1700
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,160
What pose do you want?

1701
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,360
I'm taking a selfie. Why are you hiding?

1702
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,680
narcissistic.

1703
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,440
No way.

1704
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
I'm really taking a selfie.

1705
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,760
See for yourself.

1706
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,200
How is it? Are you leaving?

1707
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,320
How does it feel?

1708
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,600
I want to cry.

1709
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,800
I don't want to leave Bobo.

1710
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Come to Shanghai.

1711
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,400
I'll pick you up in Shanghai.

1712
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,680
It's not clear yet.

1713
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,480
Hua has the ability.

1714
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,920
to say a lot of things directly.

1715
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,560
I want to cry, I don't want to leave Bobo.

1716
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,120
You'll feel that everything is very formal.

1717
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,640
If you want to say,

1718
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,800
she will

1719
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,360
naturally.

1720
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,120
Yes.

1721
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,480
But you will find that Terri mentioned

1722
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,440
He said

1723
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,800
who wants to be observed longer.

1724
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,720
He may need to be observed

1725
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,000
to confirm a relationship.

1726
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,880
To be honest,

1727
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,760
in love,

1728
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,080
in love.

1729
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,280
I'll leave myself a way out.

1730
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,200
Maybe the previous relationship experience

1731
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,960
didn't go well.

1732
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,280
I'll do it one by one

1733
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,760
It's like a blank.

1734
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,640
Just like our mobile phone scanning face.

1735
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,520
You can scan the circle slowly.

1736
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,560
When you're happy,

1737
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,920
you will

1738
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,840
Just like my heart now

1739
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,080
I'm 100 percent sure.

1740
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
Mi-na.

1741
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,720
with a guy,

1742
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,240
what questions

1743
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,920
in this observation period?

1744
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,120
Or if I like him,

1745
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,400
as long as I like him?

1746
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,640
Because I may be

1747
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,400
who can break a horse.

1748
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,640
He's very carefree.

1749
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,960
And he's very manly.

1750
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,480
He's very cheerful.

1751
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,840
So I like men who don't talk too much.

1752
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,080
Be reserved.

1753
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,040
I saw the other half today.

1754
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,200
is actually

1755
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,960
another part of your personality.

1756
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,200
Yes, we complement each other.

1757
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,320
If I think

1758
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,880
to be together,

1759
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,960
It's comfortable.

1760
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,240
I think we can date.

1761
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,360
In the process of love,

1762
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,480
in the period of observation.

1763
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,760
Make sure

1764
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,640
in the observation period.

1765
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,560
I'm sure of his character, his three views,

1766
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,680
and the way we get along.

1767
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,000
That's why I devoted myself to it.

1768
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,720
I wrote a song called

1769
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,320
"Idol Type".

1770
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,240
It's called "ideal type".

1771
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,200
There's a lyric in it.

1772
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,520
is that after I met you,

1773
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,040
all the criteria are empty talks.

1774
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,240
Yes.

1775
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,880
I'm just a person who cares about feelings.

1776
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,680
Love is emotional to me.

1777
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,000
Because after being together,

1778
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,600
if you two are really suitable for each other,

1779
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,440
you can complement each other.

1780
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,840
and change.

1781
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,200
Sometimes when love comes,

1782
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,480
you can't stop it.

1783
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:19,880
Yes.

1784
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,480
When love comes,

1785
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,640
you can't be so rational.

1786
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,120
You're willing to change for each other.

1787
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,840
About the situation of a foreign relationship,

1788
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,440
Su Zihao has been trying to solve it.

1789
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,280
What do you think?

1790
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,720
How long are you going to see him?

1791
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,720
I can only try my best

1792
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,240
to balance this problem.

1793
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,560
If this is not what I expected,

1794
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,800
I'll try to fix it up to my expectation.

1795
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,000
Whether it's going to Japan,

1796
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,040
or she comes to England.

1797
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,840
Halley hasn't come back yet?

1798
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,960
He's back.

1799
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,880
Yes.

1800
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,240
Do you want to see him?

1801
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,800
I'm in a complicated mood.

1802
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,440
Why?

1803
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,880
The "puppy" is coming.

1804
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,720
What's wrong?

1805
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,880
What's wrong, Tata?

1806
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,760
What's wrong? Don't be upset.

1807
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,480
Go, two of you.

1808
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,880
Don't disturb me and Ms. Hua.

1809
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,880
Let's go upstairs.

1810
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,640
Go.

1811
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,800
Say whatever you want.

1812
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,200
Tae-seo looks like a big brother.

1813
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,720
Yes.

1814
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,000
If you're not sad,

1815
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,720
I'm going to bed.

1816
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,520
But if you're sad,

1817
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,680
I'll talk to you.

1818
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,760
You'll regret it if you sleep.

1819
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,280
Go ahead.

1820
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,840
Please.

1821
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,920
I will.

1822
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,200
Okay.

1823
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,880
Okay.

1824
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,120
Say it. Don't say it.

1825
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Let me explain.

1826
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,680
I've changed a lot.

1827
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,080
To me,
