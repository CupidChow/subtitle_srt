1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,040
Are you still cold?

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,920
Where's the heater?

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,400
I'll put it on later.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,480
Where should it be?

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,440
What are you doing?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,040
I'll tell you when it's frozen.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Boss.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,920
Hello.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,320
I want to learn something from you.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,200
I want to learn more.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,520
How do you say I like you?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
It can be expressed like the girl I like.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
I like her.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
I like her.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,880
I was talking to Tom just now.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,800
Tom is crying.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,680
Yes.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm very happy.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,560
Love Siblings

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Double love.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
intervention.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,120
Love and Social Healing.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Love Sisters.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,360
Let's welcome

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,640
love family members.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,200
We're going to

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,479
the update of this episode.

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,400
Xiao Ling.

29
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,280
Who's calling me?

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Tu.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm coming in.

32
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,600
I was talking to Tom.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,280
What did he say?

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
I think he's a little disappointed today.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,720
Tom is crying.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,600
Yes.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,840
I'm very happy.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,720
He said,

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,240
I shouldn't smile now.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,600
It's okay.

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
You cried for him yesterday.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,680
He said I cried for him yesterday,

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
when I cried for him yesterday.

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
He felt so guilty.

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,240
He just cried at me.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
I feel so guilty.

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm so sorry.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Hey.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Cry again. Let me see.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
How did he become me?

51
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,920
Why is everyone doing this?

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,280
He said

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
I hugged you

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,079
I hugged you.

55
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
Then I said,

56
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,600
The drawing is experienced. It's different.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm inexperienced.

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
I've never cried with my sister.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
Then why did you cry that day?

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
Again.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,440
If you ask again,

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
it has nothing to do with me.

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,480
He actually has this side.

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,800
Xiaoling, you should thank me.

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
Is he still crying?

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,240
No.

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,760
He's recovered.

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,320
Okay.

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,040
Pretend you don't know.

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,280
Okay.

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,640
Okay.

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm matching my clothes.

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm the only one in this room who takes things seriously.

74
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
I need to improve.

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,040
and break through myself.

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
Let it be.

77
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
It's quite stressful.

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,520
Are you sleeping?

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Are you crying?

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,520
Su Ziyi.

81
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
Come and take a look.

82
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,000
The soup is crying.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Why?

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I don't know.

85
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
Is he asleep?

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
I don't know.

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
No.

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm fine.

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,240
Can you stop...

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,440
What's wrong with him?

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
I don't know.

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,280
Then what are you doing?

93
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,280
I had a chat with my sister.

94
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,160
About my sister.

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm fine.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,399
Okay.

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,399
But when he came out of this room,

98
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,640
he was normal.

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,360
Why is he suddenly so sad?

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,080
I don't know.

101
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
What does it have to do with me?

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,840
I don't know.

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it because I sent too little today?

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
He sent me a long text.

105
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
Did you send it long?

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,440
No.

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
One sentence.

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,960
He sent you a long text.

109
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Maybe.

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm worried about his condition.

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
To be honest,

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
How was the soup?

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,600
Yes.

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay, bye.

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
What?

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,320
What's wrong with me?

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,280
I just chatted with my sister.

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,000
I was sad.

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,760
Mainly, I feel that in this room,

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
I don't know

121
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm not very happy.

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know who I am.

123
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
You're not happy.

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
I feel my life is gone.

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
My life is class training.

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,159
And I think

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
my sister cares.

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,840
I may care about her more than I do.

129
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,000
than I do.

130
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,880
I can't help myself.

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
Take a break.

132
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:48,960
Indeed.

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,200
I think you are

134
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
a

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
a very fixed life.

136
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,920
Be self-disciplined

137
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
Training is good,

138
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,600
But I suddenly jumped out of the comfort zone.

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,159
All my life

140
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,880
has nothing to do with me.

141
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,680
I feel like I'm doing

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,160
I've never done.

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
is to jump out of your comfort zone

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Break the rules

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,080
I can't get used to it.

146
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
I think I can grow up.

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,400
But

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,360
It's a big challenge indeed.

149
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes.

150
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
The mood of this day

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
I've been at school for ten days.

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,920
in the school for ten days.

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Is it because...

154
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Are you here for a relationship?

155
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm telling you.

156
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
I feel like

157
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,600
I feel like I have at least ten days.

158
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,159
I won't have such emotions in my normal life.

159
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,360
or even more.

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
I get angry every day when I'm in a relationship.

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
I can feel that

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
in a month.

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,120
We are emotional.

164
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
To be honest,

165
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,840
it's not very healthy.

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,159
But I think

167
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,840
But I'm like this.

168
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,200
To be honest,

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,760
I can't change it.

170
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Indeed.

171
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,880
So sad.

172
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,880
So sad.

173
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,400
Really

174
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,360
The most narrow-minded two

175
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,240
started to be roommates.

176
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm really not.

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm not kidding.

178
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Really.

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Because I'm narrow-minded.

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
You're more talkative than me.

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,600
Sometimes I don't say it.

182
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,400
I just...

183
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,000
Actually, when I'm in a relationship,

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
They asked me

185
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
why I didn't tell them

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,800
when I'm angry.

187
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
Then why are you here? I'll tell Tata.

188
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,800
I think

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
if I don't say it now,

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,640
it'll be hard for me

191
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,240
to express it face to face.

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
If both of us are in the same city,

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
one is

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
a country,

195
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
I might not be like this.

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,960
Yes.

197
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,840
So

198
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
the environment changes.

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,480
I can only say

200
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
this house has become

201
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
a comfort zone.

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,680
In a situation?

203
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,360
No.

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
Not at all.

205
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Are you feeling better now?

206
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,320
That's because I found someone I like.

207
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,760
In other words,

208
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,320
if I can't find it,

209
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,400
I'll never feel comfortable.

210
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
But I don't know

211
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Write papers.

212
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Hurry up.

213
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,159
Hurry up.

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
Your sister said she forgot to urge you

215
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
to give this task to me.

216
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm afraid I'll forget.

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
Have you forgotten when you were young?

218
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,720
You've been cold to me for a long time because of someone.

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,080
Think about who you did it for.

220
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,000
Because of whom?

221
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
A man or a woman?

222
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
A man

223
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,160
My sister's son.

224
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
Does Tientsin eat meat bun?

225
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
The stuffed meat might be in Xi'an. I'm sorry.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,039
I'm speechless.

227
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,679
Why?

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
I don't know.

229
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,919
It's so annoying.

230
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,400
Look.

231
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,760
The color is too shattered.

232
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Just put it on the side.

233
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,760
Do you want to see

234
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,800
how happy your sister is smiling now?

235
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,240
It's okay.

236
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
Don't cry.

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,320
Men don't cry easily.

238
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
Wipe it.

239
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:04,960
No.

240
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,720
I feel sorry for you.

241
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,240
I think it's quite normal.

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,480
We're not that close.

243
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
It doesn't mean we're not close.

244
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
or something else.

245
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
It's not any sign.

246
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Write papers.

247
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Hurry up.

248
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Hurry up.

249
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,720
Your sister said she forgot to urge you

250
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,280
to leave this task to me.

251
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
We're going to Tianjin.

252
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,400
Listen to me.

253
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,280
Hello.

254
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,600
Welcome.

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
Three VIPs.

256
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,760
Three.

257
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,160
Welcome to the cat.

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,920
We don't have much time.

259
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
So do you think

260
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
is necessary?

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes.

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
We'll never see each other again.

263
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,400
Although it's a long distance,

264
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,720
I might be, right?

265
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
You may also come to Shanghai.

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Gather around.

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Are you a pajamas?

268
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Who?

269
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Yours.

270
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Do you know your taste?

271
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,400
He's lazy.

272
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Stop it.

273
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,160
Tae-seo will understand.

274
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
He didn't even tell me about the spring outing.

275
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
spring outing.

276
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,680
OK.

277
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,600
spring outing.

278
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Yinbo, you just heard them insult me.

279
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,360
It's a spring outing.

280
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You hit me.

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
It's okay. You're really pretty.

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
I won't talk to all of you today.

283
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,280
and isolate all of us.

284
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,480
Yes.

285
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go out.

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's go.

287
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,640
Did you have trouble sleeping last night?

288
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,880
Looking forward to today.

289
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,360
Xinxin and I brushed our phone until nearly three o'clock.

290
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,080
Are you too excited to sleep?

291
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Yes, elementary school students have syndrome.

292
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,040
When I fell asleep at night,

293
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,760
I thought

294
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
I can't sleep too well.

295
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm going out tomorrow.

296
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,720
I was so excited.

297
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
But you slept very well.

298
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,960
She said she hit me at night.

299
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
But I remember you woke up.

300
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,040
I apologized.

301
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
You apologized to me?

302
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,120
I don't remember anything.

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
She hit you.

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
She hit me and she apologized to me.

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,640
I don't remember anything.

306
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,520
I hit her.

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
I think I hit her hard.

308
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,360
I think we should take a nap later.

309
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
It's a long journey.

310
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,920
Take a nap.

311
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,320
Me too.

312
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,760
Later we'll...

313
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,480
wake up and shine.

314
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
Face it with the best posture

315
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,480
The male guests who get off later.

316
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you want to do in Tianjin?

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,520
I want to ride the Eye of Tientsin.

318
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,640
Because I've never taken a Ferris wheel.

319
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm looking forward to our date.

320
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Me too.

321
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,720
Me too.

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,640
Really?

323
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,040
What a pity. Let's sit in the Eye of Tientsin.

324
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,280
Sure.

325
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160
If they don't go,

326
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
the five of us can sit alone.

327
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,680
OK.

328
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,000
Five people in one room.

329
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm going to eat dog dumplings.

330
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,400
But I don't like steamed buns.

331
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,640
Didn't you say there are fried dough twists in Tientsin?

332
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,720
I like steamed buns.

333
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,480
Eat.

334
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Eat a lot.

335
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
I eat everything.

336
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm not picky about food.

337
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,920
But I eat everything except buns.

338
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
Because I don't like steamed meat

339
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
And the steamed meat and that

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
You don't like steamed dumplings either

341
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,400
I like steamed dumplings

342
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,880
Because the skin of steamed dumplings won't become soft

343
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,840
It won't be sticky and soft after it gets wet

344
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
It's still delicious.

345
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,640
If the skin is wet,

346
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,200
it'll be a little disgusting.

347
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,080
Yes, I think if the buns are wet,

348
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
it won't taste that good.

349
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
So today,

350
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
we can advance the plan.

351
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,800
Didn't we agree

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,720
to sleep together?

353
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,840
So we can plan ahead of schedule today.

354
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes.

355
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Okay.

356
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,320
The day before the end.

357
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Get in.

358
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Okay, let's go.

359
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
I texted Harry.

360
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,320
We went to the beach to feed seagulls,

361
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
and took a lot of photos.

362
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,360
Happy.

363
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
I received an essay.

364
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
Be happy.

365
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm happy with Tata.

366
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,800
Including taking photos for her,

367
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,720
we can take selfies

368
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,600
the things we did together,

369
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,720
will always be there.

370
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,400
and very special.

371
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
At least very special to me.

372
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,200
I think it's because

373
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,160
a big step closer.

374
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,400
Some of his movements

375
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,120
So I think

376
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,160
he'll think I've given him a sincere response.

377
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,120
I feel Susu's love today.

378
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,960
This is a sentence I read before.

379
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,880
This sentence is

380
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,000
we sit on the rocks and watch the sea together.

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,520
we might fall in love with each other.

382
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
This is one of my fantasies.

383
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
in my imagination.

384
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,640
Because I love the beach.

385
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,360
I took pictures for him.

386
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,920
and he took photos for me.

387
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
I think it's romantic.

388
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,280
It's a picture when you open it.

389
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,520
He asked me to be more confident

390
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,960
He wants me to be more confident.

391
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
He thought I was pretty.

392
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,360
I guess he said I was Sherlock Holmes.

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,040
because

394
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
something more detailed,

395
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
I'll catch you.

396
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
Then he kept saying

397
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,000
I was looking forward to our trip tomorrow.

398
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,920
So I think

399
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
we both wanted to

400
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,040
we wanted to play with each other tomorrow.

401
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,640
I think it's good.

402
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,600
We can spend a day

403
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,080
in Tianjin.

404
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,640
Today's message

405
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,160
to Xiaoling.

406
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,760
I feel very happy

407
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,560
I feel very happy.

408
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,400
and unforgettable.

409
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,440
I sent a message about my feelings.

410
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,960
and gave it to Map.

411
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,680
The content is

412
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,119
I had fun today.

413
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,160
And he took a photo for me.

414
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,520
I think it's actually very effective.

415
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,920
But I also told him

416
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm not good at posing.

417
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,839
He's very patient.

418
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
I think he's very considerate.

419
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,560
There are many similarities.

420
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,720
We talked a lot.

421
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,200
So I told him I was looking forward to

422
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,960
tomorrow's trip.

423
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
The text I received today

424
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,120
was also sent by Hua.

425
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,680
She also praised me for being good.

426
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,040
and 360 degrees without blind spots.

427
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,480
Although we didn't get the first place,

428
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,280
but in our heart, we are the first.

429
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm grateful that

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
for recording me by the beach

431
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,320
and took pictures of Seagulls and me.

432
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,760
and seagulls.

433
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,560
So I want to express

434
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,720
the recognition and praise

435
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
and praise.

436
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,560
Tae-seo sent me a message about his feelings.

437
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
I had fun today too.

438
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,600
It's nice to take photos.

439
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,760
She took such a good picture for me today.

440
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,280
that she took for me today,

441
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
to express my gratitude.

442
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,480
I think Hua and I

443
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,760
with Hua

444
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,800
We're quite in sync.

445
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,080
We got together very well.

446
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,040
And we shot each other well.

447
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,280
So we texted each other very well.

448
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
The content is similar.

449
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm not happy.

450
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,800
I've got so many. You've got so little. I'll take a look tomorrow. Okay.

451
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,360
I don't...

452
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
I'll speak my language to him.

453
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,160
No.

454
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,840
Yes, he will understand.

455
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,080
He should have guessed

456
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
you won't receive it tomorrow.

457
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,720
Yes.

458
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,520
The message you sent that day was "no".

459
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
I felt like I was back

460
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,240
when I first met Hua.

461
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
But I know Hua won't send it to me.

462
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,640
I think

463
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,120
Fatty wants to get closer to me.

464
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
but I don't think we have a chance.

465
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
If it were me today,

466
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,680
I might want to meet some guy.

467
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
but that guy

468
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,120
never met me

469
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
or contact me.

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
or contact,

471
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,560
I wouldn't have sent him this message.

472
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,360
Yes, it's a sincere message.

473
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
Do you want to sit in the middle?

474
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,480
Are you still cold?

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,360
Where's the heater?

476
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,840
I'll put it on later.

477
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,920
Where should it be?

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
What are you doing?

479
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,080
I'll tell you when it's frozen.

480
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
He’s so considerate.

481
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,120
Of course.

482
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,240
Learn from me.

483
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Eat first, right?

484
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
I didn't eat

485
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,200
I want some more pepper sauce.

486
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,720
Me too

487
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Hello.

488
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,440
Hello, everyone.

489
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Let me serve you

490
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
our signature dish.

491
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
Seafood rice?

492
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,800
Spanish seafood rice.

493
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,120
As the saying goes in Tientsin,

494
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,560
it doesn't mean you can't pass if you borrow money.

495
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,880
What?

496
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Lend us money.

497
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,600
Can you get us five small bowls

498
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,240
with five small bowls?

499
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
Sure, no problem.

500
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,840
Okay.

501
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,240
Thank you

502
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Sir, we need more pepper sauce.

503
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,640
Can we have some?

504
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,920
Pepper sauce, no problem.

505
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,680
Thank you.

506
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,480
Here's your pepper juice

507
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
Okay, thank you.

508
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,480
You're welcome.

509
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Boss, are you from Tianjin?

510
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Of course.

511
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,880
You want to learn Tientsin dialect, right?

512
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,600
Yes.

513
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,720
What do you want to learn?

514
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,360
It's delicious.

515
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,680
It's delicious.

516
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,440
Yeah.

517
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,440
You're so pretty.

518
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,320
It's so pretty.

519
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
You're so pretty.

520
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,200
Sister

521
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
How is the food?

522
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,480
It's delicious.

523
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,920
Thank you.

524
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,040
It's delicious.

525
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,200
Enjoy your meal.

526
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Okay, thank you, boss.

527
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
The boss is so cheerful

528
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
The food cooked by happy people is delicious.

529
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Anyway, when I cook,

530
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,600
as long as I'm happy,

531
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,880
you can't say it's not delicious.

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,000
It's okay. I'll just make it for Hua.

533
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,480
No.

534
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
Let's take the plate.

535
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
This one.

536
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,280
I just took it.

537
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
I need to use the bathroom.

538
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Boss.

539
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,040
Hello.

540
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,440
I want to learn something from you.

541
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,320
I want to learn more.

542
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
I like what you say.

543
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,480
What do you want to learn?

544
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,720
to express like the girl I like?

545
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,560
I like her.

546
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,920
I like her.

547
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
You can say that.

548
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,400
Just say, "Sister, you're so pretty."

549
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
I want to be with you.

550
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,360
That's it.

551
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,880
Tientsin people speak frankly.

552
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
Sister, you're so pretty.

553
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,800
You're so pretty.

554
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,960
Do you have a boyfriend?

555
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,120
If you don't have a boyfriend,

556
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
can you consider me?

557
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
If you don't have a boyfriend,

558
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:04,840
Yes.

559
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Do you have something stronger in Tientsin?

560
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,280
If you don't have a boyfriend,

561
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,560
you can consider me.

562
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,720
If you don't have a boyfriend,

563
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
you can consider me.

564
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,600
Let's make do with it.

565
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,120
Okay, thank you.

566
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,000
Are you done?

567
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,680
Yes. Why?

568
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
Isn't it far away?

569
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,360
Okay, you can eat more.

570
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,280
Let's go.

571
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,120
Let's go.

572
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Where's the map?

573
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Where are they?

574
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,040
They are over there.

575
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,640
Let's go find them.

576
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,440
They are cooking.

577
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,520
Why are they eating?

578
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,880
Come on.

579
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,120
You two know to come back.

580
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
We're looking for you.

581
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
Are you giving each other sachets or something?

582
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
We...

583
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,440
have the same taste.

584
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840
We chose the same one.

585
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,680
How did you make the sachet?

586
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,000
Did you put it in?

587
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,040
He helped us get it in. Yes.

588
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,960
You two chose the same flavor

589
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,240
You chose the same flavor.

590
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,520
Or...

591
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:09,960
No.

592
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,880
After we smell it,

593
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,800
it's still sandalwood.

594
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,480
It's hot.

595
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,480
You dip it in vinegar again.

596
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,040
I like vinegar.

597
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
It feels good.

598
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
Eat it again.

599
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
Don't waste it.

600
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,680
I'm full.

601
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,720
One more.

602
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,040
Why do you have chili?

603
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,600
Chili with buns?

604
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,240
Look at the vinegar with chili and steamed buns.

605
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Let's go.

606
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,240
Let's go.

607
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,840
Next stop.

608
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,120
So sweet.

609
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,920
Yes

610
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,600
You're so sweet in 2002

611
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,840
Don't talk to kids in 2004.

612
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,120
Age will affect your choice?

613
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,200
No.

614
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,520
If you have such a prediction,

615
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
it must have something to do with your past experience.

616
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,840
Because I once had

617
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,320
a very successful relationship.

618
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,920
That boy is younger than me.

619
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,680
And I think

620
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,920
I had a hard time.

621
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
and took care of him like a sister.

622
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,760
And he changed a lot.

623
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
I told myself secretly

624
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,320
I won't find someone younger than me next time.

625
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
It means I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

626
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,640
After I met Mr. Zhou,

627
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,240
because our team

628
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,160
For example, it's good.

629
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,320
They want to recommend it to me.

630
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,920
I can find his information online.

631
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,080
His age is 1980.

632
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,280
I was born in 1981.

633
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,480
So he's one year older than me.

634
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,160
So this is exactly what I expected.

635
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I was happy.

636
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,240
And we started dating.

637
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,320
There was a chance

638
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,800
I saw his ID card.

639
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,080
He was born in 1982.

640
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
So he was younger than me.

641
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
I cried.

642
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
I cried.

643
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
Because I think

644
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
I felt that

645
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,560
Because we were very close.

646
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,840
I was scared.

647
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,040
Yes, I'm scared. I feel

648
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
all my trauma came back.

649
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
Then I just cried there.

650
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
I wondered why this happened.

651
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,280
The more I don't want to find it, the more I run into it.

652
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,040
I'm afraid

653
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
I might end up like that again.

654
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
Yes.

655
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,880
So I think

656
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,000
this kind of mind must have been experienced before.

657
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I won't look for it.

658
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,960
Even if it's a small day I promise myself

659
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Yes.

660
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,560
But this is the only time.

661
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,240
But I think age

662
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,480
is not a problem at all.

663
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,440
Age is just a physical age.

664
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,880
Mental age is more important.

665
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
My husband

666
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
is probably one round older than me.

667
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,320
He should be mature.

668
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
He turned me into a little girl.

669
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,680
In the past,

670
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,960
when I first met my husband,

671
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,280
I've already graduated from my master's degree.

672
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
and he's still studying undergraduate,

673
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,360
I knew it.

674
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm older than him.

675
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,400
Then I asked him when he was born.

676
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
He told me he was born in 1995.

677
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,640
Because I was born in 1991.

678
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,520
Because in 1995,

679
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,400
he was four years younger than me.

680
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
I've never been in a relationship like this.

681
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,640
I said I was one year younger.

682
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
I said I was born in 1992.

683
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
Then we started dating.

684
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,680
About two or three months later,

685
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,040
I saw his passport once.

686
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,200
He was born in 1996.

687
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Both of them

688
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
step forward.

689
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,080
shrink to three years old.

690
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Actually five years old

691
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,920
Five years older.

692
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
When I saw his passport,

693
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
when I saw his passport.

694
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,800
He quickly told our introduction

695
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,520
our best friends.

696
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,880
Deer won't go on a date with me.

697
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Because she found out

698
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm actually younger than I thought.

699
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,000
And...

700
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Of course, after watching it,

701
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,840
I think it's funny.

702
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,040
I lied to him for a year too.

703
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,840
Yes.

704
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,280
Yes, you can see that effort.

705
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,760
Yes, I didn't say that.

706
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,720
Later he thought

707
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,280
he thought I was going to be furious.

708
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,000
But then I didn't.

709
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,760
Because I think

710
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
age doesn't matter.

711
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,120
but he's actually cute.

712
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,320
It means he cares about Lu.

713
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,080
because he cares about Lu.

714
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,240
just to get closer to you.

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
I don't want any obstacles.

716
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,080
Yes, I think.

717
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,600
I think

718
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,880
I would be touched.

719
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,800
I just pretended nothing happened.

720
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,920
It's great.

721
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
The cat is back.

722
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
Kitty is back.

723
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,720
I haven't been back for a long time.

724
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,720
My room

725
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I love it.

726
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Let's go.

727
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,240
The small box goes down first.

728
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,920
It feels like it's the first time to come back to the house.

729
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,640
Bro,

730
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
Will it eat it?

731
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Who said it's hungry?

732
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,520
They seem to have a fight.

733
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,440
Two?

734
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,360
I don't know.

735
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
They said they saw two.

736
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,360
Come on.

737
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,320
What?

738
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Aren't you tired?

739
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
But I'm not tired when I play.

740
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,840
Come on, Cao Xiaoling.

741
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,160
Call my full name.

742
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,760
Are you done?

743
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Not long.

744
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,320
But it's only 30 seconds.

745
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,720
You have long hands and legs.

746
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
It does feel like you're fighting.

747
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,560
And you need to bend lower than others.

748
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,240
And it's not easy to pursue a body.

749
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,160
And my schedule is too long.

750
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,400
For example, when doing this,

751
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,320
Others may use 0.5 seconds.

752
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,520
I may need 0.7 seconds.

753
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,040
So this restricts your

754
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
I think it has influence.

755
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
Talent indeed.

756
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,800
Actually, your physical condition is...

757
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,280
The best condition for ping-pong is

758
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,120
is that

759
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,080
a boy is about 1.75 meters tall.

760
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,440
And Donsil.

761
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
Actually, my biggest problem

762
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,000
my biggest problem is

763
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,680
their balls are too good.

764
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,440
It's totally different

765
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
with my usual training.

766
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
I can't keep up with the rhythm.

767
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,080
The ball just finished.

768
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,320
The next one is coming.

769
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,480
I can't keep up.

770
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,800
It's not a matter of consciousness.

771
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
It's just their usual strength.

772
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,240
They are very strong.

773
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,280
The ball is fast.

774
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,800
And

775
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,280
they reacted quickly.

776
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,640
The training environment is also related.

777
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,200
They practice the same quality.

778
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
If I

779
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
lower than them in training,

780
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,040
I can't play in games.

781
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,000
Right.

782
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,160
Why didn't we say happy New Year

783
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,280
Happy New Year.

784
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,040
Yes.

785
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,800
When your roots light up, let's...

786
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,360
Happy New Year.

787
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,880
You have to say, "Ready, go!"

788
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,160
Happy New Year.

789
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Or is it the main figure of a person?

790
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,360
This photo is not repaired.

791
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
No.

792
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,920
I did a great job.

793
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
Good job.

794
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
It's really pretty.

795
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,400
Let's go see the soup later.

796
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,560
They are in front.

797
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,080
Princess, please get off.

798
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
Are you getting off?

799
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,680
Princess, please step down.

800
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm Room Two.

801
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,240
Together.

802
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,880
Funny

803
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,040
I turned around

804
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,400
I chose white roses.

805
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,840
The flowers are like you.

806
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,960
pure, elegant,

807
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
and ignorant of the world.

808
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,800
I hid my sincerity in the flowers and gave it to you.

809
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,280
Look over there. Yes.

810
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
What a great face.

811
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,040
Look here. Look up.

812
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,840
Raise your head a little bit to me.

813
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,760
I think you look good no matter what.

814
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,040
Let's do it together.

815
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,920
This is good.

816
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

817
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,200
Yinbo, I’m grateful to you all my life.

818
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,560
I’ll be there at any time.

819
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,240
It's okay.

820
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,840
OK, Yinbo, thank you.

821
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,640
In fact, many interesting things

822
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,320
many interesting things will happen.

823
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,880
Especially

824
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,640
a couple who just got close.

825
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
may have a good chance

826
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,360
to judge each other.

827
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,560
Of course, this is just the beginning of their love.

828
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,200
There will be many things

829
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,920
in the future.

830
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,840
Yes.

831
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,760
In the next episode,

832
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,800
will be

833
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,760
the heart party of boys and girls.

834
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Can they stand

835
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
the sharp questions from their close friends?

836
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Let's look forward to the next week's show.

837
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,560
Let's sing "Love Sisters".

838
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,800
Double the love.

839
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,159
What mission?

840
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,120
Confession is coming.

841
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,280
For boys and girls

842
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,000
for boys and girls.

843
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,719
Let's swim.

844
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,679
Soak this.

845
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,840
Do you accept men

846
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,280
a man you're meeting?

847
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,000
I don't accept it.

848
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,159
I even think I'm not good enough for her.

849
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,400
Does Xiaoling know

850
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,800
she's the second choice for your date?

851
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,880
So,

852
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,480
Is he

853
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,320
be eliminated by you?

854
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,199
So you came to me?

855
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,080
Okay, stop it.

856
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,600
Have you broken

857
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,360
has broken

858
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
your ideal type?

859
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,679
Who was once

860
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,679
your competitor?

861
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,080
The person you're meeting

862
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,239
because you really like him,

863
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,480
or find a partner?

864
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,840
So scary.

865
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,840
What?

866
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,520
Are you not satisfied with this result?

867
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,360
I think I said something wrong.

868
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,160
So sharp.
