1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like we'll have some wild wine right away.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull, refreshing and breathing.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,120
It's like drinking wild wine

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,160
It's as fluffy as a skull. My scalp will breathe.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,160
will watch "Love Brothers" first.

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,680
will watch Love Sisters first.

10
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,240
Someone's here again.

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,880
It must be his brother.

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
Hurry up.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Why are you so excited?

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,000
You go. You are the most excited.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,440
He said something wrong. I really...

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,560
No.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,800
Guess if it's a man or a woman.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,280
A girl.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
Three, two, one.

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
It's also the peak of beauty.

21
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,400
My brother.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Mission card.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,240
It's a mission.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,600
Okay, it's the mission.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
You need a plan.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
The picture is not here.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,440
Okay.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,880
I'll read it this time.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,440
You read it.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,039
To the boy in the house.

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,919
Welcome new members to the cottage.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
We prepared a

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,680
for boys.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Let's go to the designated location.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's go.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,880
When I got the text that a guy went out for dinner,

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,079
I was thinking,

38
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,960
Oh no.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
The three boys

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
would ask me a lot of questions.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
and attack me.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm actually a little nervous.

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
They are all so tall.

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Indeed, all four boys have different styles.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,120
They're totally different.

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,520
You said you wanted to eat pizza.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's eat.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,040
Anyone wants some?

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
This tastes like white grapes.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,200
I'll drink white grapes.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
30 degrees

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,079
30 percent.

54
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,960
That's juice content.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
It's my favorite peach flavor again.

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll have a low alcohol.

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,520
Cheers.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,320
Cheers.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
What did you talk about yesterday?

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,440
Let's start with the soup, okay?

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
What did I talk about on a date?

62
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Because you're the first one among the three of us.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,320
What did you talk about?

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,120
Did you choose your date by yourself?

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
or random?

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
Not yesterday.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,480
The girl chose the date yesterday.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
It's girls who choose boys.

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,079
It's not girls who choose boys directly.

70
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,560
but after the girl chooses the boy,

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,440
you have to vote for his brothers.

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,600
So the date yesterday

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,840
was a coincidence.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes.

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
If a girl chooses a boy,

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
For example, she wants to go on a date with you.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
But she must guess

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
who your brother is

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,640
to succeed.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
If you guess my brother,

81
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,200
go on a date with me.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,640
Not with you.

83
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
I gave the wrong one.

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,839
Really?

85
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,320
What?

86
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
Isn't that weird? It's weird.

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
When you arrived,

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,320
you're not the person you want to see.

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,440
Really?

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
It's her, not me.

91
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
Yes, the girl.

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,080
I think boys

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,640
will have this part.

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,760
Tonight?

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
But you already know.

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,640
We don't know.

98
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,680
But

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
we have a guess.

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,680
But we don't know.

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
We know more than I do.

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,720
Tell me.

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
You came in today and saw this.

104
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,120
The two you think are the most alike

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
Harry and him.

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
The girl on the right.

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Harry and the girl on his right.

108
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
That's Harry and Xinxin, right?

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,160
Okay.

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,760
It's okay.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
You guessed right.

112
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
Amazing, right?

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Right?

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
That's amazing.

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
Very confident.

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
Because

117
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,240
you two have more interactions.

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
Really?

119
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Yes.

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
Yes, she should be the elder sister.

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,080
It feels like talking to you

122
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes.

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,040
Very overwhelming

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes, it feels like a sister

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,800
to her younger brother.

126
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Yes.

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,520
The two most alike

128
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,560
are not inside.

129
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,640
He and his brothers...

130
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Right?

131
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,600
No, she's here today.

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I don't believe it.

133
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
His brothers are here today.

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,640
Really.

135
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
I don't believe you. He's definitely not here.

136
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
Is your brother here today?

137
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Guess.

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
She must be here.

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
Do you think she'll come today?

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,160
Is it possible that she's already here?

141
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
Impossible.

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Impossible.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
Why?

144
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,840
No reason.

145
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
I can only say that I'm good at acting.

146
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,120
It's possible, really. I majored in acting.

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes.

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
I learned acting.

149
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
Everyone here

150
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,640
has a lot of thoughts.

151
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
This boys' chatting house

152
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,200
shouldn't talk about

153
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,560
We should talk about the opposite sex.

154
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,280
Yes.

155
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
Is there anyone you like?

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Just ask who you like.

157
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,200
Who do you like?

158
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,400
I haven't touched

159
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,640
Just say the first glance.

160
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
Testing?

161
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,520
Is everyone here?

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,240
It's hard to say.

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,240
Let's talk about the three here first.

164
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
are going to bite their teeth.

165
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Look at the soup.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
A little.

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,360
Because I

168
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,720
I think

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
I don't think we've got enough contact.

170
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,440
Because I think all three girls are good.

171
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,240
Yeah.

172
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
Let's ask what type do you like.

173
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
These three boys are almost attacking him.

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
They're attacking

175
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
I like people who get along with each other.

176
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
We may have more common topics.

177
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,480
But appearance doesn't matter.

178
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
Not very important.

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Your personality is more important.

180
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
All important.

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,640
I'm sure they all look good in our house.

182
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,040
Yes.

183
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
You can also ask us a question.

184
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,840
Let me think.

185
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,320
After all, you've lived

186
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,000
for three or four days.

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,280
Did you have a date?

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

189
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,480
Just get in touch.

190
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Are you interested in it?

191
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,120
Yes.

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
All of them?

193
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,320
Some people still haven't arrived.

194
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
Both.

195
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
You too.

196
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
What are you doing?

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Someone is there.

198
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,920
He's the most obvious.

199
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,560
Really?

200
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
Really? I didn't feel it.

201
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
You didn't feel it?

202
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,240
If you feel it, something will happen.

203
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
Your siblings.

204
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,880
Soup is interested in your brothers.

205
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,480
If you guess it like that, he's my brother.

206
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
For example, Soup likes your brothers.

207
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,640
How do you feel?

208
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
You will...

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
If Soup likes my brother,

210
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,480
I'll pay more attention to the soup.

211
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,720
Normally.

212
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
What do you think of him?

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,840
Yes.

214
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Where's the soup?

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,160
It depends on

216
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,120
if he can play ping-pong.

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,440
Can I play with you?

218
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Can I beat you?

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
Maybe it depends on his sincerity

220
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
or his character.

221
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
The rest may be behind.

222
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,200
It depends on his character first.

223
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
I think we're all the same.

224
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not.

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
Aren't you?

226
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,240
Then answer me.

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,400
Let's see if he's pretending or not.

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,960
If he is,

229
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
no matter how good he is,

230
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,400
he may not be able to tell.

231
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
He's just pretending.

232
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,960
What if your brother loves him very much?

233
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,600
No.

234
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
Then you will say

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Tell your brothers

236
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,240
if you want to be with him,

237
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,760
I won't help you.

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Yes, will you stop it?

239
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,720
I won't.

240
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
I think

241
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,760
if I had found out,

242
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,680
it wouldn't have happened.

243
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,800
made my brothers like him very much.

244
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,040
You will get involved.

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
I will.

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,480
You would tell her a lot about this man.

247
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
that he's not good.

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
If he's really bad, he'll...

249
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
What about you?

250
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,160
I should be like you two.

251
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,640
I know how to observe.

252
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes, I won't say it.

253
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,920
I'll deny someone

254
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
by some trivial things.

255
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,840
I may have a long period of time.

256
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
If you go out

257
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,960
with a girl,

258
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
what would you do with her?

259
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,280
Good question.

260
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,720
I don't think I'll take her there.

261
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,840
I'm good at it.

262
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,920
I want to take her

263
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,080
something I want to try.

264
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,880
For example, skiing.

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,440
But I've never skied.

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,920
Neither have I.

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,640
You don't either?

268
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,240
Do you want to try?

269
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I want to try.

270
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,920
Can you take me there?

271
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
The three of us.

272
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Like this.

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,400
OK?

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Okay.

275
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,880
What about you, Fatty?

276
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,520
What do you think

277
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
with a girl?

278
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,520
what would you think?

279
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,520
I might feel relaxed

280
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,920
and choose a nice cafe

281
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,720
and have a chat.

282
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,680
Will you take her to race?

283
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,120
No.

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
Because I think the first date

285
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,800
is mainly

286
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
to get to know each other.

287
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,200
Maybe we should communicate.

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
I agree.

289
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,520
I will take her to a hotel.

290
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,200
I guess...

291
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
Let's eat and have afternoon tea.

292
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
and watch a movie.

293
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,360
Let's have afternoon tea.

294
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
I think afternoon tea is a good choice.

295
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,520
Terri is good.

296
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,640
He's quick.

297
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Yes.

298
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,520
Because this kind of environment

299
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,280
is not easy.

300
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Yeah.

301
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,160
Show us.

302
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
I think different situations

303
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
different situations.

304
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,680
For example, in the small house,

305
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,840
our personal information is relatively confidential,

306
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
We don't know

307
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
each other's growth experience.

308
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,280
At this time,

309
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,960
I might choose to take her

310
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,600
where I grew up.

311
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,080
or what I've done the most,

312
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
I want her to know more about me.

313
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
If it was in the small house,

314
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,880
I would be like this.

315
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
But if it's outside,

316
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm usually socialising.

317
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
At this time,

318
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,800
maybe we should go somewhere for dinner

319
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,640
or go to the park.

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,040
Do you remember

321
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,320
the first time

322
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,080
the first date

323
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,840
on a date?

324
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
Personally, I like it.

325
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,880
Maybe the cafe

326
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
in the cafe.

327
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
Because I like to get to know each other

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
through chatting.

329
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
Maybe hobbies, music categories

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,840
or watch movies.

331
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,400
Because if we go to the amusement park

332
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
or watch a movie,

333
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,160
through external stimulation

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,680
through external stimulation.

335
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,280
It's our first date.

336
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,080
Actually, I don't recommend going to a cafe.

337
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
Because when two people are facing each other,

338
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,720
Except eating and drinking coffee

339
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,640
or we just have to talk.

340
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
or a quiet place.

341
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
For example, whose home?

342
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,040
She wants to know more about

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,320
Yes.

344
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,920
Okay.

345
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,040
Yes, I like chatting.

346
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,080
I think

347
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,320
you need something to rely on as the handle.

348
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
It'll be better.

349
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes.

350
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,320
Because I remember

351
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,920
the first time Mr. Zhou asked me out

352
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,800
because I just arrived in Beijing.

353
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
He asked me out to see furniture.

354
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,960
Yes, you know about furniture.

355
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,360
I didn't expect

356
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
he would introduce

357
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,280
the furniture he knows.

358
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,960
On one hand, he has artistic taste.

359
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,600
He has his own philosophy of life.

360
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,920
He will pretend to decorate it for you.

361
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,640
What should I do with this room?

362
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,480
I had a good impression of him at that time.

363
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
This man...

364
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,200
That's great.

365
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,280
Yes, you have good taste.

366
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
And you have

367
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,800
his rival.

368
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
He has that prediction.

369
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
He's warm.

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
We can talk while walking.

371
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,880
Sit on this sofa

372
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
and say something.

373
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
I went around for a long time.

374
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,000
But what will happen

375
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,160
the consequences?

376
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,800
Well,

377
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
when we officially confirm

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,800
we must be together,

379
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,520
he will face

380
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,640
He has a house of furniture.

381
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
I have a house of furniture.

382
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,120
Then we become furniture with two houses.

383
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,840
But I think

384
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,600
he got extra points.

385
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,200
At least he didn't do it for a purpose.

386
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,440
I must be with you

387
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
to get close to you.

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,960
Yes.

389
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,800
But every time I see it,

390
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,920
I feel

391
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,240
and funny.

392
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes.

393
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
But I don't care about

394
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
or an exhibition.

395
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Actually, I think

396
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
this first date is quite good.

397
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes.

398
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Zun.

399
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
Do you remember the first time...

400
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,920
Yes.

401
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
the first time I took her to the amusement park,

402
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,800
I didn't dare to.

403
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,160
For example,

404
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,480
take her to a quiet place.

405
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
Like the cafe you mentioned,

406
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,680
and chat one-on-one.

407
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,040
I'll be nervous.

408
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,000
I have to cover my blanket even if I call her.

409
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,640
I dare not call when the lights are dim, you know?

410
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,440
When I asked her out,

411
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
I was very nervous.

412
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
So I asked her to go to the amusement park.

413
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
I think

414
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,400
relaxed.

415
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
Relax.

416
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
Because there are some roller coaster

417
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,640
and walk.

418
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,320
You can also have ice cream.

419
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,840
Yes.

420
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,320
I wasn't that nervous.

421
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,040
Now when I think about it,

422
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,080
the scene of my first date

423
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,000
It's quite low.

424
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Down.

425
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
What does it mean?

426
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
When I was a freshman,

427
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,880
in my first year,

428
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,240
I took the other person

429
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
my favorite

430
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,680
It's very dark.

431
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
in a barbecue stall.

432
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,200
Because I like it very much.

433
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,760
So my first judgment

434
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,120
I would take her to the restaurant

435
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,560
my favorite restaurant.

436
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,680
Sure.

437
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
I ordered a big table.

438
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,240
All meat skewers.

439
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,320
And the barbecue in Xinjiang

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,720
are big and big.

441
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,400
When they come up,

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,320
on the top.

443
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Then I...

444
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Eat

445
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,560
The tripe is good

446
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
I sprinkled a lot of chili.

447
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,120
Eat.

448
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
But

449
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,480
I don't know her eating habits.

450
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,360
And then...

451
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,280
they didn't move.

452
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,880
I thought

453
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,080
I was shy.

454
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,960
But I can't be shy.

455
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Don't waste it.

456
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,560
On the second date,

457
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,240
she was the one who took me down the road.

458
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,520
This is very romantic.

459
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,480
Just walk along the main road.

460
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,400
Go straight.

461
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,040
From the sunset to the night

462
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
When I get old,

463
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,640
And the weather was very suitable.

464
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,520
So I remember it very well.

465
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm different.

466
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
For example,

467
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,960
For example, in a small house,

468
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,920
there's a girl in a small house

469
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,840
requested a secret conversation with you.

470
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,280
Please leave in your own way.

471
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,640
Walk out of the store quietly

472
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
Go to the designated place

473
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,200
To Fatty.

474
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
I think at this time,

475
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
maybe we should go somewhere for dinner

476
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,920
or park.

477
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,800
So attentive.

478
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I mean it.

479
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,840
In the small room

480
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm going to the bathroom.

481
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,040
Go ahead.

482
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,880
Who do you think

483
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,320
sent this mysterious invitation to Fatty?

484
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,040
Is he his brother?

485
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,440
Tae-seo's.

486
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
Tae-seo's brother.

487
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,920
Yes.

488
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,680
How did Tae-seo's brothers notice him?

489
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,000
Is she observing in secret somewhere?

490
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
No way.

491
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,320
I've never seen before.

492
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
A new girl.

493
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,400
The side looks nice.

494
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,200
My name is Tata.

495
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,840
I'm a full-time model.

496
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
So beautiful.

497
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
So pretty.

498
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Very unique.

499
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,280
Hello.

500
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,720
Hello

501
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,119
What's your name?

502
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
My name is Fatty.

503
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Fatty. OK.

504
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,440
You can call me Tata.

505
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,400
Tata.

506
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
A lighthouse.

507
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Okay.

508
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Her eyes

509
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
Her eyes are like a cat.

510
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,560
I saw a pretty girl at first sight.

511
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,320
smiling at me.

512
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
So my mind went blank.

513
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
I didn't know what to do.

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
So sincere.

515
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't know why he chose me.

516
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,440
I was caught off guard today.

517
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
I was really nervous.

518
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,840
When did this girl

519
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,080
start to show up?

520
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,720
I noticed you were fat.

521
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,560
So you are...

522
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

523
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,520
At the same time?

524
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,280
No.

525
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
You're my first guest.

526
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,280
It's an honor.

527
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Yes.

528
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,760
Did you see the photo or...

529
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
Yes.

530
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
Your childhood photo

531
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,800
I picked RICHMJRYD when I was young

532
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
I picked it when I was young

533
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,440
Yes.

534
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,480
Just looking at the photos.

535
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,800
Interesting.

536
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,080
Decide the order of meeting

537
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
Does it mean we have to meet each other?

538
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,080
Yes, I think so.

539
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,520
I decided to see this first.

540
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,400
Next, you'll meet the boy from the cottage.

541
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
Ten minutes for each conversation.

542
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,800
If it takes more than 10 minutes,

543
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
you can extend or stop the conversation.

544
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,320
Please pay attention to your time.

545
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,120
The conversation time is 60 minutes.

546
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,880
She'll meet four boys in 60 minutes.

547
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,560
The photo of your childhood.

548
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
This photo

549
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
smiling brightly.

550
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,760
I think you're a cheerful person.

551
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,360
Really?

552
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
It's an honor. Yes.

553
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
Take a look again.

554
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,960
But I can see that you're a little fat.

555
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,440
So cute.

556
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,080
It's an honor.

557
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
I didn't expect

558
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,480
I would meet the first male guest

559
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,360
to meet the first female guest.

560
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,440
It means when I was a baby,

561
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
I was far ahead.

562
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
The back is crooked.

563
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm honored

564
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,280
to meet you first.

565
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,840
How about a toast?

566
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,840
So you've been here for four days.

567
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes.

568
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
How is it? In the small house.

569
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,000
I think everyone gets along well.

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
Are you familiar with each other?

571
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,240
Yes, we are.

572
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
And we have brothers.

573
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,600
So we got into that state quickly.

574
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,080
And everyone is relaxed.

575
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
So tonight,

576
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
for the first time.

577
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,160
I might feel awkward.

578
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm an introvert.

579
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,480
You are an introvert.

580
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
I need you to guide me.

581
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,560
OK.

582
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,360
Our current situation

583
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,840
Boys and girls E and I

584
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,560
and I.

585
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,280
I think girls have good personalities.

586
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,800
That's good.

587
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,320
What do you do?

588
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,240
I start my own business.

589
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,520
RICHM.

590
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm a full-time model.

591
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,720
You're a full-time model.

592
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,600
We have a full-time model today.

593
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,280
Really?

594
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,160
What a coincidence.

595
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,760
Maybe earlier than you.

596
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,480
A little earlier.

597
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,720
Today?

598
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
Tata is a model

599
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,520
Terri looks very elegant too.

600
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
They have the same occupation.

601
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
I think they are siblings.

602
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,080
That's the conclusion.

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
So cute.

604
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Can I ask you a question?

605
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,040
Because I think you are slimmer.

606
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,960
So do you have any requirements

607
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,920
your ideal type?

608
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
No.

609
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,760
No.

610
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,160
It depends on the eye.

611
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,080
My eyes are round.

612
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,520
Fatty gives me the feeling.

613
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
Just as I expected.

614
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
He's a cheerful guy.

615
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,400
He can liven up the atmosphere.

616
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,720
Fatty.

617
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,320
Fatty has changed.

618
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,320
I'll have some more cake.

619
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,800
Our food is good today.

620
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Did anyone cook during the day?

621
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,280
Yes.

622
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes.
RICI.

623
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,080
Are you cooking?

624
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,240
What do you think, RICP?

625
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,920
What do you think, Rich?

626
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,880
I think you can cook.

627
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,200
Feels like RICH

628
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
Feeling

629
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,560
Really

630
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,000
No JOAN

631
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,760
RIC HMN

632
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,000
I didn't feed myself

633
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,480
with my own hands.

634
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,560
Whose hands

635
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,200
Delivery.

636
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,240
But I ordered too much food.

637
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,760
I don't know what to eat.

638
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,080
I have a lot of delicious food there.

639
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,280
Is it spicy?

640
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,480
No.

641
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,680
Make it light.

642
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm going to eat a bit hard.

643
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
You'll eat a lot.

644
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,720
It's a bit spicy.

645
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,960
Then you and your brother have different taste.

646
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
How do you know who my brother is?

647
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,360
I can infer

648
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,840
based on this news.

649
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,400
Because I like to guess.

650
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,480
I won't tell you.

651
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,080
Okay.

652
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,760
I'll slowly discover

653
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,600
Tata's eyes

654
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,520
It can generate electricity.

655
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes.

656
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,880
Do you have any romantic lines

657
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Is there someone you like?

658
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,560
Or someone you like?

659
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,040
Yes.

660
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,760
At present,

661
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,440
we are still getting to know each other.

662
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,960
It's okay. You came just in time.

663
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
What do you mean?

664
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,040
Everyone is getting to know the stage.

665
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,160
But no one came so early.

666
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,560
You can take a look at the rest.

667
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
some boys.

668
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,960
Does this photo look like me when I was young?

669
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
Yes.

670
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,200
Really?

671
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
I need to reply.

672
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,960
I think it looks like me too.

673
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
It's cute.

674
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
Do you think Tata will continue?

675
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,080
I think so.

676
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,480
It's cute.

677
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,000
You're the only

678
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,160
with a big smile.

679
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,080
It's over.

680
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,000
She didn't extend.

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
Okay, I'll get going.

682
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,120
See you later.

683
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,560
Okay.

684
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,440
Bye.

685
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,720
I didn't choose to extend my weight.

686
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,320
That's because

687
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,160
he was the first guy I met.

688
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,240
Just keep it.

689
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,920
I want to leave the chance to the boys behind.

690
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,880
and see what's going on.

691
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Tata gives me

692
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,240
a Japanese girl.

693
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,720
A very elegant girl.

694
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
They have a good chat.

695
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
You seldom see a boy like this, right?

696
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,960
right?

697
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,840
Unless you like it very much.

698
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Yes.

699
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,280
After all, the house has been here for four days.

700
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Three or four days, right?

701
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,080
Do you have any good suggestions?

702
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Good advice?

703
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,360
For girls,

704
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
It depends on who you like.

705
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,160
If you like someone,

706
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,240
I can't give you advice.

707
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,360
What if

708
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,160
in your situation,

709
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,680
she might want to go on a date with you,

710
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,840
but she chose me.

711
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,800
Should I

712
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
know how to get along with her?

713
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
If you like someone,

714
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,680
or someone you like.

715
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
Look at me.

716
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I can see that

717
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,600
that my roommate and I like.

718
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
I'll ignore them.

719
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,920
But when I see someone,

720
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
I'll give you an idea.

721
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Good.

722
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,640
Or see your siblings?

723
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,400
It doesn't matter to see my brothers.

724
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,360
I can give you some advice.

725
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,040
Okay.

726
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
That's enough.

727
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
What did you do

728
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,840
what did you do in the house?

729
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,200
What's the most important thing?

730
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
Every night at 10 p.m.,

731
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,840
send a message to those who like you.

732
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,120
Yes.

733
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,960
Then your brothers

734
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,560
will know how many texts you received.

735
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,280
Thank you. This message is very important.

736
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,880
The soup is smiling bitterly.

737
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
Where's Fatty?

738
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Bathroom.

739
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
It's a little far.

740
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
A little long.

741
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm home.

742
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,960
Did I miss something?

743
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
A lot of things.

744
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,160
Look at his face.

745
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
You'll know how hot the conversation is.

746
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You know what?

747
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Why am I the only one left?

748
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
Did you guys speed up?

749
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,800
Did I miss that much?

750
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,640
A lot.

751
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,120
So

752
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
guess who my brother is?

753
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,280
I don't think your brother is here.

754
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,840
Your brothers are not here.

755
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,120
Maybe she's here.

756
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
I don't believe she's here.

757
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,960
Do you want to make a bet?

758
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,680
A bet?

759
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,240
A bottle of fruit cubes.

760
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,920
Ten bottles. One bottle is too little.

761
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,520
That's right.

762
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
What do you mean?

763
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
One and a half.

764
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Okay, one and a half.

765
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,880
No, we have so many days.

766
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,280
right?

767
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,040
This thing...

768
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll apply for it.

769
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,240
Can I go to the bathroom?

770
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
Sure.

771
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,840
I just went there.

772
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,520
Can we change a reason?

773
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,880
You guys talk first.

774
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Don't feel awkward.

775
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,400
Don't miss me too much, okay?

776
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,400
The bathroom is over there.

777
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,160
Outside, right?

778
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,760
Put on some clothes.

779
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,640
The bathroom is over there.

780
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,120
Okay.

781
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't miss me too much, okay?

782
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Okay.

783
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,960
Hello.

784
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,720
Isn't it here?

785
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,120
It's here

786
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,360
It's here Hello

787
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,880
It's here

788
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
There's a new face

789
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,520
There's food.

790
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,640
I'll take off my clothes.

791
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,680
They look good together.

792
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
Are you not full?

793
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,760
No.

794
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,160
I'm not full.

795
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,080
I ate the most.

796
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
I ate five or six pizzas.

797
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,160
Okay, you can continue.

798
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,960
I can't.

799
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,760
Look at my stomach.

800
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
Harry is natural.

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Yes.

802
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
I haven't eaten.

803
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,520
If you told me earlier,

804
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,320
I would have brought you the pizza.

805
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,800
I didn't know you were eating.

806
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,880
I'll eat it later.

807
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,920
It's all gone.

808
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,400
No.

809
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,280
I ate it all.

810
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,520
He's so relaxed.

811
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,040
Go ahead.

812
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,600
It's okay.

813
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm not hungry.

814
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
What's your name?

815
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm Harry.

816
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,120
Harry.

817
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,560
Okay, you can call me Tata.

818
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,080
Okay.

819
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,640
Do you mind if I stretch my stomach out?

820
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,520
I'm really a little full.

821
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,760
No problem.

822
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
When Harry came in,

823
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,800
he gave me

824
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,360
he was actually relaxed.

825
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,440
When he came in and sat down,

826
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,200
and started to take off his clothes.

827
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,000
He kept saying he was stuffed.

828
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,840
I think he's a little funny.

829
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,600
I don't mind if you eat more.

830
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,640
It's okay.

831
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,000
It's okay. Give me some noodles.

832
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
Yes.

833
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,120
The new brothers

834
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,480
are very lethal.

835
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,520
Because they are

836
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,080
I think everyone will like them.

837
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,680
Yes.

838
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
and charming.

839
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,000
Because their profession

840
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,880
they have high EQ.

841
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,960
Can you cook?

842
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,640
I can cook.

843
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,160
You can cook?

844
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,560
Yes.

845
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
What will you cook?

846
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,000
What do you want to eat?

847
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,600
What do you like to eat?

848
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
Spicy food.

849
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,000
Spicy.

850
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh no, you don't know how to cook.

851
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,680
You can learn.

852
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,160
Okay.

853
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,760
Actually, I'm not good at it.

854
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,920
I learned it step by step.

855
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,880
I can cook everything my brothers like.

856
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,920
But

857
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
I learned it for her.

858
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Not really.

859
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
It's mainly to make a living abroad.

860
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,800
to make a living abroad.

861
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,960
It's really a foreign student who cooks

862
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
Foreign students fool students.

863
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
I'm in London.

864
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,520
I can't order any Chinese food at home.

865
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
I can only learn to cook by myself.

866
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,320
The Chinese food there may not be authentic

867
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,600
It's definitely not authentic here anyway.

868
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
Your accent is...

869
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,720
Guess where I am from.

870
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,280
No, I have the answer in my heart.

871
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,720
You have the answer?

872
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
Okay, let me know when you have a chance.

873
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Do your brothers have accent?

874
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,360
No.

875
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
I can only tell you that my brothers

876
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,840
are not very similar to me.

877
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,680
It's not easy for me to guess, right?

878
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,840
Not easy.

879
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,720
It's not easy according to normal logic.

880
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,840
It's not easy for others.

881
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,480
You already guessed what you think.

882
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
I've basically guessed it.

883
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,720
Tell me something.

884
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,400
I haven't seen them now.

885
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,560
or anyone.

886
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,920
I'll be the first one.

887
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,880
It's an honor.

888
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,560
Seriously.

889
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,520
She hasn't answered yet.

890
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,960
It's an honor again.

891
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,920
I have a photo of you when you were young.

892
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,120
Why?

893
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,160
You have my childhood photo?

894
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,080
Yes.

895
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,680
Aren't you curious?

896
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,240
Wait.

897
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
Sort it out.

898
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
Wait, I'm a little nervous now.

899
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
I was chosen

900
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,880
chosen me

901
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,600
and chose this meeting.

902
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
Okay, got it.

903
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,960
I chose this meeting.

904
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,080
Just looking at me

905
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,200
I see. It's okay.

906
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
You're so clumsy.

907
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
Do you know which one it is?

908
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No.

909
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,720
Here.

910
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Wait.

911
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
What? You don't dare to look?

912
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm afraid it's too ugly.

913
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,720
Just break it for me.

914
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,280
It's not ugly. It's cute.

915
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,640
Okay, let me see.

916
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
This one.

917
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,560
Wait.

918
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,080
Did you choose me because of this photo?

919
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
So cute.

920
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,440
I thought it was just

921
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,200
I was assigned.

922
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,000
You can also say that.

923
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,520
Yes.

924
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,320
You're now a roll, roll, roll, roll, roll.

925
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,840
Me, right?

926
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,120
No.

927
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
They talked so quickly.

928
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,440
The atmosphere is great.

929
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
Okay, the regular question room is here.

930
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Okay.

931
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,560
Hobbies.

932
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,600
Hobbies, taking pictures, watching movies,

933
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,520
Playing badminton.

934
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Really? I play badminton.

935
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,720
But I'm not good at it.

936
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,680
but I love playing.

937
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,280
Speaking of which,

938
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I just bought a badminton net today.

939
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,520
Really?

940
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,400
I bought a ping pong table

941
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
and a badminton net.

942
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,840
Good.

943
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
Do you have any other hobbies?

944
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,120
No, about the movie.

945
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,640
Movie, suspense.

946
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,960
Wait.

947
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,280
I like suspense movie too.

948
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,600
What's your favorite movie?

949
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,880
The Unseen Guest.

950
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,320
Wait, I haven't seen it yet.

951
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,080
"fatal ID".

952
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,240
I've watched "fatal ID".

953
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,360
This is OK too.

954
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,600
I seldom watch those.

955
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,160
It's like listening to songs.

956
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
I never remember the name.

957
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,600
I can't remember either.

958
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,080
I only remember its melody and its

959
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,880
Just listen and listen.

960
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
Yes.

961
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,880
And you can hum.

962
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
Yes.

963
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,680
Work news.

964
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,520
Where were you?

965
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,280
She extended time.

966
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,160
Yes.

967
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Excuse me.

968
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,320
We talked about the movie

969
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,240
after the movie.

970
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,360
Can you sing?

971
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,920
I think I can do it.

972
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,480
Not bad.

973
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,320
But my family said I'm tone-deaf.

974
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,320
I get along well.

975
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,880
Because when I was chatting with him,

976
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,920
the atmosphere is more harmonious.

977
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Because he takes the initiative to talk.

978
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,120
It makes me more relaxed.

979
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
So at this moment,

980
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,280
to extend the chat time.

981
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes.

982
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
We actually have a segment.

983
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,120
Every time we enter the house,

984
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,800
I ask what MBTI is.

985
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,600
I'm ISFJ.

986
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,680
Then I'm "little old man".

987
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,760
"Little old man".

988
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,240
INFJ.

989
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,560
Yes.

990
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
You're not introverted at all.

991
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,360
Because when I feel awkward,

992
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,120
I want to talk.

993
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,760
When you feel awkward,

994
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,480
It's awkward to talk to me.

995
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,440
No, it's just self-embarrassment.

996
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,920
On the first day,

997
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,840
I went into that room

998
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
I talked a lot.

999
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,280
When I went in, they said,

1000
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,840
I said, "Hello, I'm Harry."

1001
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm INFJ.

1002
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,480
After 10 minutes,

1003
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,080
Are you really an introvert?

1004
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,480
You've been questioning me

1005
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,840
Am I an introvert?

1006
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,960
But on the second and third day,

1007
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
I didn't talk much today.

1008
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Because it's already cooked.

1009
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,440
You were so talkative just now.

1010
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,680
This is the first time we met.

1011
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,720
It's okay. We'll get to know each other again.

1012
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,040
No, it won't be like this tomorrow.

1013
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,360
Okay.

1014
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,640
Fortunately, I'm an introvert.

1015
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,000
I was wondering how we could talk.

1016
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,240
I (introverted) and I (introverted)...

1017
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,040
with me.

1018
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,640
Let me tell you.

1019
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,800
If you want to go on a date,

1020
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,360
or hang out with someone else?

1021
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
do you think it's someone who talks a lot

1022
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,640
or someone who talks less?

1023
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,880
He must be talkative.

1024
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,160
ISFJ, right?

1025
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,720
J.

1026
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,880
I have a plan.

1027
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,360
But...

1028
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,840
I understand.

1029
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
You belong to

1030
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,440
If someone else is better at making plans,

1031
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm willing to let him do it.

1032
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,080
Yes.

1033
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,200
But if that person

1034
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,760
P,

1035
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,720
you can make this plan.

1036
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,640
Yes.

1037
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,960
We need a plan.

1038
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,560
I think so.

1039
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,480
Yes.

1040
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,640
I agree.

1041
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,800
We actually finished our date yesterday.

1042
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,040
So you had a date yesterday?

1043
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,880
Yes.

1044
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,000
I was on a date yesterday.

1045
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,680
I felt like a good friend.

1046
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,239
We just met, but...

1047
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,360
No, I think my first sight was very accurate.

1048
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,080
You thought we were friends at first sight.

1049
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,760
you can't develop anymore.

1050
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,080
And I'm someone

1051
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,639
If we were good friends,

1052
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,920
I wouldn't be a (lover).

1053
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes.

1054
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,440
Wait.

1055
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm a bit full.

1056
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
Didn't you hear that it's ripe?

1057
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
I don't want to hear it.

1058
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,159
Actually, I really want to guess the love line.

1059
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,920
I guessed it on the first day.

1060
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,239
Can you guess mine?

1061
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,639
Can you guess it?

1062
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,679
Only you have intentions.

1063
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,840
Or your brother?

1064
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,440
I meant it.

1065
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,239
I can guess it.

1066
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,760
You can never guess.

1067
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,960
I can guess it all.

1068
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Not folding.

1069
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,480
Not folding.

1070
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:01,800
Xiaoling.

1071
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,720
Not folding.

1072
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,760
Xiao Ling.

1073
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,440
He's lying. He's lying. He's lying to me. He's lying to me. He's lying to me.

1074
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,440
I look forward to it.

1075
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
predict him.

1076
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Can I guess? Yes.

1077
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,160
Yes.

1078
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,360
We only talk about the first sight.

1079
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,960
Are you sure you want to say it now?

1080
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,600
Because two girls haven't arrived.

1081
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,440
Take a guess.

1082
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,360
I think you

1083
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,960
you don't remember his name at all.

1084
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,600
I know the order.

1085
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,680
One to the right side of Harry

1086
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,600
In the middle, two.

1087
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,680
Then three.

1088
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Okay, let's guess each other.

1089
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,480
Okay.

1090
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,240
Really?

1091
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Tell us.

1092
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,120
I think three.

1093
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,200
Say something.

1094
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
I think neither of you can guess it.

1095
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Maybe.

1096
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,200
Go ahead.

1097
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,160
Susu.

1098
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,480
Oh no.

1099
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,160
I didn't know

1100
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,080
you are actually

1101
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,840
If you're interested in someone,

1102
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,880
you will deliberately avoid it.

1103
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
Yes, intentionally. Yes.

1104
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm like this.

1105
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,840
The three girls

1106
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,000
a little bit in front of one.

1107
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
But I'll avoid it.

1108
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,520
Oh no, soup.

1109
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,560
I'm nervous.

1110
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,680
The soup collapsed.

1111
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,200
Yes, it collapsed.

1112
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,080
So he deliberately ignored that person.

1113
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,520
It's my turn to ask you.

1114
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,560
You can ask.

1115
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,200
I'll ask Fatty first.

1116
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,400
What type of girl do you like?

1117
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,600
I like Fang.

1118
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
I get along with my personality.

1119
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,720
and cheerful.

1120
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,920
It seems that

1121
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,160
hobbies are very important.

1122
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
You need to

1123
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,160
have a good chat.

1124
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,200
I must have common hobbies.

1125
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
We are very similar.

1126
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,760
Yes.

1127
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,240
Because I'm an E

1128
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
an outgoing person.

1129
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
Maybe I'm more

1130
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,960
In this way,

1131
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
we can do many things together.

1132
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,520
Will you take the initiative to the female guest you like?

1133
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,160
I am.

1134
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,920
You are?

1135
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,160
I'm completely opposite of you in this aspect.

1136
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,760
Do you take the initiative?

1137
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,040
Fatty is really amazing.

1138
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,200
Fatty is so smart.

1139
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,920
He's just like me.

1140
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,600
He means...

1141
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,880
If the girl you like

1142
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,400
there are two people in love at this time,

1143
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,960
will you choose

1144
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,080
wait or give in?

1145
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,240
Or do you want me to go too?

1146
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,120
Will you fight for it?

1147
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,880
I will wait.

1148
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,720
You will wait.

1149
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,640
But

1150
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,000
if the girl responds to me,

1151
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll take the initiative.

1152
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,640
He's so nervous.

1153
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,520
Nervous?

1154
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,960
If you don't take the initiative,

1155
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,600
if you don't take the initiative?

1156
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
I mean

1157
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,760
maybe one of the two boys

1158
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,520
she might take my side.

1159
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,880
and give me some information.

1160
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Bite his teeth.

1161
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,880
He kept

1162
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,800
He keeps gritting his teeth.

1163
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Relax.

1164
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,920
You'll try to communicate with her

1165
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
and see if she'll give me this response.

1166
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,680
If I did, I would...

1167
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,920
you would take the initiative.

1168
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,240
But you won't be too active.

1169
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Yes.

1170
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,920
OK.

1171
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,240
I feel like he's his love rival.

1172
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
Well,

1173
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,120
I just said

1174
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,920
We're friends, right?

1175
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,960
Give me five.

1176
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,680
Fair competition.

1177
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,360
declare war.

1178
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,480
Okay, no problem.

1179
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,200
I agree.

1180
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
Right, I just said

1181
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,520
we might be

1182
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
the same girl.

1183
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,880
That's what I mean.

1184
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,320
I didn't mean

1185
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,120
I thought you were passive like me.

1186
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,920
Yes, you were passive too.

1187
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,440
Right?

1188
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Yes.

1189
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,800
I think it's good.

1190
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,280
We all know it.

1191
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,040
This is fair to everyone.

1192
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,280
Su Su's eyes are always on Terri.

1193
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,800
I think

1194
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm more handsome than him.

1195
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
But he has a better temperament than me.

1196
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320
He makes me feel threatened.

1197
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,200
and pressure.

1198
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,600
But fair competition

1199
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,560
Compared to soup,

1200
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,320
I can cook.

1201
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,720
I think this is my advantage.

1202
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,400
I may be more mature

1203
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,040
and more interesting.

1204
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
What are you doing?

1205
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,080
It's nothing.

1206
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,400
Fatty said luckily there was no conflict with me.

1207
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,040
It's not like that.

1208
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,000
The crisis is coming.

1209
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
See you tonight.

1210
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,280
Okay.

1211
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
See you later.

1212
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,480
Bye.

1213
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,480
Good morning.

1214
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,560
How are you?

1215
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,640
Not bad.

1216
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,240
We just went up the altitude.

1217
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes.

1218
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,960
What height?

1219
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
I really can't tell you this.

1220
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,640
This is a secret.

1221
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,120
Exciting.

1222
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
How exciting.

1223
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,400
Which one do you think

1224
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
my first impression of?

1225
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,560
My brother.

1226
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,440
How did you guess Xinxin?

1227
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
No.

1228
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,080
No?

1229
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,720
No, it's a little funny.

1230
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,560
It's so funny, cube.

1231
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
It seems right after a long round.

1232
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
But it doesn't seem right.

1233
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,600
Why not?

1234
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,360
Really? Inner?

1235
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,240
Don't you think so?

1236
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
Probably.

1237
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm just like him.

1238
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,920
It's okay.

1239
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,840
So why don't the three of us live together?

1240
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,320
Sure.

1241
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,360
I need to use the bathroom.

1242
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,920
Okay, go ahead.

1243
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
All excuses are the same.

1244
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,080
Thank you for your permission.

1245
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,960
Hello.

1246
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,720
They're very eye-catching.

1247
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,560
Hello.

1248
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,840
The third person I saw was soup.

1249
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,880
Soup?

1250
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,160
His appearance is unique.

1251
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,880
and distinctive.

1252
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,520
Hello.

1253
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,560
How should I address you?

1254
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,080
Just call me Soup.

1255
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,920
Soup?

1256
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,560
Yes.

1257
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,440
You can call me Tata.

1258
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,640
Tata.

1259
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,720
Okay.

1260
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,600
Nice to meet you.

1261
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
It's a little cold.

1262
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,320
Let's drink water.

1263
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,680
This is awkward.

1264
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,000
Look at the soup.

1265
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,960
Without Susu,

1266
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,520
Without Susu, all of a sudden.

1267
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Yeah.

1268
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,960
We can't move on.

1269
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,840
Yes.

1270
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,120
You're an introvert E.

1271
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,560
I am. Guess.

1272
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,840
Small (introverted).

1273
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,880
E.

1274
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,240
Not really.

1275
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,200
No.

1276
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
You are E.

1277
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm an outgoing person.

1278
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,440
E is not.

1279
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,880
You are not E.

1280
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,640
But it feels like

1281
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
by soup.

1282
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,000
A E

1283
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,640
Yeah.

1284
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,160
I'm introverted.

1285
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm more introverted.

1286
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,080
Are you here alone?

1287
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,160
Yes.

1288
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,200
Okay.

1289
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,840
We can't talk at all.

1290
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
I have a problem.

1291
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,040
How many people have you met?

1292
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Guess.

1293
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,840
Two.

1294
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,280
No.

1295
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm the first one.

1296
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,120
So you just arrived?

1297
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,760
Yes.

1298
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,560
I took a photo of you when you were young.

1299
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,880
A childhood photo?

1300
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,520
Let me see.

1301
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,320
I thought he was a foreigner.

1302
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,880
He looks like a half-blood.

1303
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,120
I'm a mixed.

1304
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,960
Which part?

1305
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,480
China, America.

1306
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,760
Okay.

1307
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,720
I think you had a bite of this blueberry.

1308
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,320
I didn't have dinner.

1309
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,800
Eat more.

1310
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,480
I actually ate a lot.

1311
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,640
It's okay. I'll drink some water.

1312
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,200
How did you get along in the house the other day?

1313
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,720
I felt quite reserved at first.

1314
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,320
Do you have

1315
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,760
in the house?

1316
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,520
Something like that?

1317
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,400
Yes.

1318
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,160
Yes.

1319
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,560
Did you guys have a date?

1320
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,040
Yes.

1321
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,480
What do you usually do?

1322
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,480
Maybe in sports,

1323
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,920
For example,

1324
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,240
Do you want to guess?

1325
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,520
I'm actually a semi-professional.

1326
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,760
I'm working out.

1327
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,760
Sports?

1328
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,800
Basketball.

1329
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,480
Basketball.

1330
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,440
You look tall.

1331
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,640
How tall are you?

1332
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,960
I don't know about 1.85 meters to 1.9m.

1333
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
It's too much.

1334
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,360
1.85 meters to 1.9m.

1335
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,040
Actually, the reason of my exercise

1336
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,280
I have a little chest, a little hunchback.

1337
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,400
Tennis.

1338
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,360
Tennis on the table.

1339
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,760
table tennis.

1340
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,320
Ping-pong. Will it be like this?

1341
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,760
Because you are

1342
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,480
The stage is so high.

1343
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,640
You have to play on your knees.

1344
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,240
I thought tall guys play basketball.

1345
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,440
What about you? Can I ask about your occupation?

1346
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,080
Sure.

1347
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,520
I guess models.

1348
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,360
Is it so easy to guess?

1349
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,400
How?

1350
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,440
Because the new guy

1351
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,000
I knew he was a model too.

1352
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,520
He's a model too?

1353
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,640
You didn't know?

1354
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,520
I've never seen anyone.

1355
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,840
That's interesting.

1356
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,120
My brothers

1357
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,160
are almost the same.

1358
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm a little confused now.

1359
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,680
You're almost right.

1360
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,320
Is it easy to guess your brothers?

1361
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,440
It's hard to guess.

1362
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,720
You can only

1363
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,240
and details.

1364
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,040
can be guessed.

1365
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,160
For example, when something happens,

1366
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,160
when something happens.

1367
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,560
Who is the first person he looked at?

1368
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,040
Normally, he would guess it through this information.

1369
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,160
So you'll ask your brothers for help.

1370
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,840
quietly.

1371
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,200
No.

1372
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,520
I should know this.

1373
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,960
I'll take the initiative to avoid this.

1374
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,280
My brother and I are a little obvious.

1375
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,680
A little.

1376
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,200
You've already guessed it.

1377
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,800
You already guessed it.

1378
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,080
Yes.

1379
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,040
But I'm not sure if they're right.

1380
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,440
Maybe.

1381
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,720
I'll go back tonight.

1382
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,600
Okay.

1383
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,120
Take a look at siblings.

1384
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,960
I think the soup

1385
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,320
It gives me

1386
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,360
a dull feeling.

1387
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,640
Among the three boys,

1388
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,240
He just doesn't know where to go.

1389
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,240
Let me reply.

1390
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,200
Okay.

1391
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,760
I think we'll stop.

1392
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,560
You think it'll stop?

1393
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,720
I think it will.

1394
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,040
It's really hard.

1395
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,960
This conversation

1396
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,200
It's too tiring to find a topic.

1397
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,560
Yes, too tired.

1398
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,640
I have to go.

1399
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,920
Okay. See you later.

1400
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,440
Bye.

1401
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,760
Nice to meet you.

1402
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,560
You'll be a good friend.

1403
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,880
The first time you saw her,

1404
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,400
This is it.

1405
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,120
Because she's not so arrogant.

1406
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,640
and she kept laughing.

1407
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,240
We were smiling.

1408
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,640
for so long.

1409
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,000
What?

1410
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,840
What took you so long?

1411
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,960
No, only three minutes.

1412
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
Okay.

1413
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,360
What?

1414
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,200
What are you laughing at?

1415
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,760
Nothing.

1416
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,720
I just want to laugh at you, OK?

1417
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:19,840
Yes.

1418
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,640
What do you want to know about us?

1419
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:21,920
Because...

1420
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,560
I think

1421
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,960
I have some questions.

1422
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,720
About you

1423
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,400
About your date,

1424
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,120
not siblings.

1425
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,720
Partner?

1426
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,000
Yes.

1427
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,240
A crush?

1428
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,720
In a relationship,

1429
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,600
in love

1430
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,800
or sentimental?

1431
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,120
I want to be rational.

1432
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,040
But I'm always emotional.

1433
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,560
We're the same.

1434
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,280
We'll just have a slap and a punch.

1435
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,240
One more.

1436
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,760
We are the same.

1437
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
I'm just like him.

1438
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,880
I may not be alone

1439
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,960
I'm not alone at all.

1440
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,160
I was very rational before I fell in love.

1441
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,480
in many things.

1442
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,840
But after I fell in love,

1443
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,880
a "loser" lover.

1444
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,560
Me?

1445
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,720
the same?

1446
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,440
Reason.

1447
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,000
Reason?

1448
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,160
I'm rational.

1449
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,920
Actually, it's good to be rational.

1450
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,400
More rational.

1451
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,360
Reason will make you happy.

1452
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,320
I'm more rational.

1453
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,160
He wants to see him too.

1454
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,240
It means they are not brothers.

1455
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
I need to go to the toilet.

1456
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,640
Okay?

1457
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,480
I need to go to the toilet.

1458
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:23,760
Go ahead.

1459
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,040
I'm going to organize the makeup.

1460
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,160
Yes.

1461
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,280
How is it?

1462
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,120
How is it? Let's talk.

1463
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,360
I won't tell you.

1464
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,920
How could you say that?

1465
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,520
They asked me about my first impression.

1466
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,160
Because I saw three girls

1467
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,200
I saw three girls.

1468
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,560
Three?

1469
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,000
Yes.

1470
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,480
There's a boy and a girl.

1471
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,440
They are working today.

1472
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:03,800
Yes.

1473
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,200
I only met three girls.

1474
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,000
Then they asked me

1475
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,200
question you.

1476
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,480
Yes.

1477
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,800
You have to choose one among the three girls.

1478
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,240
Who will you be more interested in?

1479
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,840
The three of them were wrong.

1480
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,160
So

1481
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,880
there are people

1482
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,040
in the house.

1483
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,080
You can't say that.

1484
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,920
Someone you're interested in.

1485
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,280
Yes.

1486
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,600
The first impression may be more interested

1487
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,480
one of the three girls.

1488
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,160
So you've already moved in?

1489
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,840
Yes.

1490
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,840
How is it?

1491
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,240
When we just entered, we were all together.

1492
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,040
and have a chat.

1493
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
It's still a little awkward.

1494
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,440
But everyone is nice.

1495
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,360
They'll say it's more touching.

1496
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,400
some topics.

1497
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,560
What activities do you have tonight?

1498
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,360
Let me join you quickly.

1499
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,200
Before entering the house,

1500
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,400
they were playing games.

1501
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,080
They're already playing.

1502
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,040
Yes, we're playing games.

1503
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
We sat together

1504
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,320
and played.

1505
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,640
They have a box

1506
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,720
a box like Truth or Dare.

1507
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,960
You draw.

1508
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,600
There will be problems.

1509
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,320
You can ask others.

1510
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,040
or others.

1511
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,240
Are there any activities tonight?

1512
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,600
I think so.

1513
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,160
You or them?

1514
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,800
They organized it.

1515
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
I came later.

1516
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,560
Yes, we'll follow the arrangement.

1517
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,840
Okay.

1518
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,360
It looks fun.

1519
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,360
Did you talk about

1520
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,960
did you

1521
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,160
a little...

1522
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,320
I won't tell you.

1523
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,360
Harry.

1524
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:43,840
Harry.

1525
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,880
I won't tell you.

1526
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,320
Okay.

1527
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,440
How do you feel?

1528
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,240
Guess.

1529
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,240
I guess you are

1530
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,320
Soup.

1531
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,960
Right?

1532
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,880
I'm not telling you.

1533
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,920
Do you know how I chose them?

1534
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,320
You chose them.

1535
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,920
Then why am I the last one?

1536
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,440
I didn't choose you.

1537
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,120
Okay.

1538
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,560
He gets angry right away.

1539
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:10,920
No.

1540
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,040
I chose it.

1541
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,600
You have to give me advice.

1542
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,640
So you should...

1543
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,480
So I asked them some questions

1544
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,280
ask them some questions.

1545
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,040
What kind of girls do they like?

1546
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,280
And...

1547
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,720
I didn't ask them that.

1548
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,440
So what did you ask?

1549
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,080
Almost.

1550
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,760
We need to resonate

1551
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,880
and have common hobbies.

1552
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,200
and get along well.

1553
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,760
Yes.

1554
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,880
It's almost the same.

1555
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,440
I actually want to eat blueberries.

1556
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,200
Let's eat.

1557
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,920
I think Harry wants to eat it.

1558
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,440
She mentioned Harry.

1559
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Harry really eats a lot.

1560
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,280
We just had dinner.

1561
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,440
he should eat the most.

1562
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,480
He kept touching his stomach.

1563
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,080
So we...

1564
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,440
In their eyes,

1565
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,120
we are siblings.

1566
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:54,920
Yes.

1567
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,480
I'm telling you.

1568
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,760
It's not easy for me to play your brother.

1569
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,720
You know what?

1570
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,240
It's not easy for me to play your brother.

1571
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,760
So I think they are in the same field.

1572
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,680
Yes.

1573
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,760
Why are you acting?

1574
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
Let them misunderstand.

1575
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,880
that means Tarri isn't Tata's brother.

1576
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,480
Yes.

1577
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,880
But maybe

1578
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,280
have cooperated in advance.

1579
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,360
You want to play this?

1580
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,240
Then why?

1581
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,760
Yes, why did you add that?

1582
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,320
What's the reason?

1583
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,400
Maybe there's another group

1584
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,360
We need to come in and confuse them.

1585
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
There's another group.

1586
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,000
Hello.

1587
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,000
I feel like I've seen you before.

1588
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,440
I think I've seen you before.

1589
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,880
Okay.

1590
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,760
They met first this morning.

1591
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,560
We just met.

1592
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,880
You can call me Tata.

1593
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,160
Tata.

1594
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,240
What's your name?

1595
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
You can call me Terri.

1596
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,960
English name.

1597
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,560
Yes.

1598
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,000
Your exclusive date has begun.

1599
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,960
Let's get to know each other through opening the blind box.

1600
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,920
Open it first.

1601
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,280
Okay.

1602
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,600
See if there's any problem.

1603
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,560
Introduce you and your brother to them.

1604
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,160
But besides age,

1605
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,600
except age.

1606
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,280
Go ahead.

1607
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,160
Look.

1608
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,040
Also,

1609
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
I have a brother.

1610
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,880
He's three years older than me.

1611
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,520
Same as me.

1612
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,160
as me.

1613
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,760
He may talk more than you,

1614
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,560
but he's gentle

1615
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,800
and calm.

1616
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,240
And I

1617
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,640
I have a sister.

1618
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,800
But she's seven years older than me.

1619
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,880
When I was young,

1620
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,280
he would take care of me

1621
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,640
I might play the role of my mom.

1622
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,400
My parents may be busy with work.

1623
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,640
I even think you know my brothers.

1624
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,680
Maybe I do.

1625
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,600
Really?

1626
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,240
We met in Shanghai before.

1627
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,400
Because once on the road,

1628
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:12,960
we met

1629
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,360
You were with your brother.

1630
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,160
Okay, I remember now.

1631
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,720
Do you remember?

1632
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,680
I remember everything.

1633
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,280
Do you remember?

1634
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,400
It closed.

1635
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,640
I didn't expect it was you.

1636
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,080
You can really be her brother.

1637
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,680
I was surprised.

1638
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,160
Because I thought

1639
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,520
I would live in a small house.

1640
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,640
I wasn't familiar with the place.

1641
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,960
I don't know anyone.

1642
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,160
I suddenly feel a familiar

1643
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,560
I feel relaxed.

1644
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,480
Surprise.

1645
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,120
It seems to be fate.

1646
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,280
It's kind of destiny.

1647
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,280
There's a possibility between them.

1648
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,360
They can also fall in love.

1649
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,040
Yes.

1650
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,320
That's what it means, right?

1651
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,840
No wonder.

1652
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,600
I remember

1653
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,880
there was a scene

1654
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,160
Tata asked Terry if you

1655
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,800
a female guest.

1656
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,240
And Terri said

1657
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,400
Then Tata's eyes

1658
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,240
was a little upset.

1659
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,840
And her hands will move from the table.

1660
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,120
from the table.

1661
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,280
There's a hidden hand movement.

1662
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,000
So Tata

1663
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,200
about Tae-seo.

1664
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,680
Go ahead.

1665
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,640
I'll get it.

1666
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,720
Take a look.

1667
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,680
Let's watch it together.

1668
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,960
We're going to

1669
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,240
in "Love Sisters".

1670
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,640
Please do what's below.

1671
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,720
Don't reveal our real identity.

1672
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,360
We need to disguise ourselves as siblings.

1673
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,800
(as a fake.)

1674
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,640
Don't tell anyone about our first meeting.

1675
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,720
It's okay. We're real siblings.

1676
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,200
Let me tell you.

1677
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,320
Okay.

1678
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,240
Two privileges.

1679
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,880
Before we announce our relationship,

1680
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,480
he entered the siblings' house every night

1681
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,080
and share stories with their own brothers.

1682
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,080
Everyone has a chance to go on a date with Cupid.

1683
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,480
Easy.

1684
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,600
Very easy.

1685
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,960
So they'll add

1686
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,840
a Cupid date.

1687
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,920
At the same time,

1688
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,560
they will enter

1689
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,640
in the house every day.

1690
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,080
Yes.

1691
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,680
to contact your original brother.

1692
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,280
Long distance contact.

1693
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:08,680
I thought

1694
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,600
because they are not real brothers,

1695
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,320
so they need to check the information every night

1696
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
and rehearse

1697
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,040
What to do the next day?

1698
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,960
Spies.

1699
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,880
Yes.

1700
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,600
The best situation is

1701
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,080
they pretend to be siblings in front of others

1702
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,880
Then they're dating in private.

1703
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,040
Yes.

1704
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,800
It'll be confusing if others know.

1705
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:28,720
What do you think?

1706
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,240
Do you think you can do it well?

1707
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,680
Yes.

1708
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,320
It's a bag.

1709
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,120
To be honest,

1710
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
your brother and I are quite close.

1711
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,000
I know what kind of person he is.

1712
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,320
Okay.

1713
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,960
I may meet you less often.

1714
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,760
I played with them a lot.

1715
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,400
So I came in

1716
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,920
I said you looked familiar.

1717
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,120
Yes.

1718
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Let's continue.

1719
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,480
I'll do it.

1720
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,080
Okay.

1721
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,760
What do you want me to give you

1722
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,640
in the house?

1723
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,880
Do you need my help?

1724
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,120
I need you to identify men for me.

1725
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,120
A bag.

1726
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,680
Check it from your man's perspective.

1727
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,160
If you have feelings for someone,

1728
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,000
I can help you.

1729
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,520
I can help you. Okay.

1730
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,280
Okay.

1731
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,080
It's mutual.

1732
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,040
Okay.

1733
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,080
I suddenly feel like I really have a brother.

1734
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,080
We're not siblings.

1735
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,160
It seems that we are

1736
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,840
we are not siblings.

1737
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,800
It seems that we might be...

1738
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,120
Yes.

1739
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,400
Let's decide the order of you entering the house.

1740
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,080
I'll go first.

1741
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,000
You go first.

1742
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,200
You can ask around first.

1743
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,000
Get along with them first.

1744
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,600
and get close to them.

1745
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,880
Then take me in.

1746
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,720
Sure.

1747
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,880
Let's pack up and move in.

1748
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,200
Okay.

1749
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
I'll wait for your good news.

1750
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,920
Remember to pick me up.

1751
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,880
I'll come as your brother.

1752
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,160
I'll go first.

1753
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,680
Okay.

1754
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,360
Ask around.

1755
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:42,960
Okay.

1756
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,200
Are you still nervous?

1757
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm fine.

1758
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,560
Really?

1759
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,120
But it's a little...

1760
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,560
Just like me.

1761
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,920
It's the same when I enter the house.

1762
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,120
But everyone

1763
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,040
It's good that you're integrated.

1764
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,240
Everyone is

1765
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,040
quite relaxed.

1766
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,440
There's a text message.

1767
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,280
Okay.

1768
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,520
I'm going back.

1769
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,000
Okay.

1770
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,480
Okay.

1771
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,240
Okay, bye.

1772
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,600
See you later.

1773
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:07,800
See you later.

1774
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,440
See you later.

1775
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,600
Bye.

1776
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,960
Now I can choose a man

1777
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,400
to enter the house with you.

1778
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,520
Song Yeon-joo, what do you think of Tae-ri?

1779
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,720
From a girl's perspective,

1780
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,920
clean, tall,

1781
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,280
very cold.

1782
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,320
It's different from the previous styles.

1783
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,520
This one seems

1784
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,000
sharper.

1785
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,840
I'm thinking about Tata.

1786
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,000
If she and her brother

1787
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,600
with her brother,

1788
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
will she find

1789
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,880
who looks like her brother?

1790
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,120
Yes.

1791
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,760
We can work together.

1792
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,160
right?

1793
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,760
Yes.

1794
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,960
Same occupation.

1795
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,680
I'm thinking about their possibilities.

1796
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,480
Yes.

1797
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,600
And Terri finally released the signal.

1798
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,760
He said it's possible for us.

1799
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,560
Yes.

1800
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,200
I think this episode is quite interesting.

1801
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,840
Because our first date with Cupid

1802
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,200
is officially over.

1803
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,160
Everyone has a chance to go on a date alone.

1804
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,120
After the date,

1805
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,760
we will find some

1806
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,360
boys and girls are getting warm.

1807
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,960
For example, Susu and our soup.

1808
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,160
For example, our Harry,

1809
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,880
and our Xinxin.

1810
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,080
But...

1811
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,720
That's our conjecture.

1812
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,520
Because in this episode,

1813
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,560
in this episode.

1814
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,200
I think this relationship

1815
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,320
more complicated.

1816
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,360
I think it's normal.

1817
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,920
Because when you meet some friends

1818
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,000
in society,

1819
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,360
you also have variables in love.

1820
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,440
Can you accept the change in love

1821
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,440
or variables?

1822
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,280
I'm looking forward to such variables.

1823
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,960
Really.

1824
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,560
Because variables are something you can't stop

1825
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,360
and control.

1826
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,720
behind the variables

1827
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,560
may be an opportunity.

1828
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,200
and also a challenge.

1829
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,600
But if your life is so plain

1830
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,400
at that moment,

1831
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,560
it will go straight

1832
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,520
with a straight line,

1833
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,720
you'll think why I'm going through this.

1834
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,640
When you face

1835
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,880
the same temptation,

1836
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,080
will you be able to find your multi-sided self?

1837
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,360
But because there are variables,

1838
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,960
everyone will find that

1839
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,760
it's a wonderful thing.

1840
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,560
So I really look forward to

1841
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,480
to accept

1842
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,760
bravely.

1843
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,400
I think in love,

1844
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,880
in love.

1845
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,080
Because it doesn't mean

1846
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,680
you want to change your original decision.

1847
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,720
but to make you more determined.

1848
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,160
But you can be firm

1849
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,880
towards someone.

1850
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,840
You don't need

1851
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,600
to make you more determined.

1852
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,800
I only choose one person.

1853
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,200
I can be happy too.

1854
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,440
Sometimes I really bid farewell to the wrong

1855
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,000
to meet the right one.

1856
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
So don't be afraid to face the wall.

1857
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,600
Don't be afraid of variables.

1858
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Let's be brave.

1859
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,440
And maybe our Love Sisters

1860
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,120
will give you something special.

1861
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,160
Yes.

1862
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,520
What's the special part?

1863
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,920
See you next week.

1864
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,400
Love Siblings

1865
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,600
Let love double

1866
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,520
Gather!

1867
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,520
Coming.

1868
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,800
Here are five invitations for partners.

1869
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,960
Finished forming.

1870
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,920
First come first served.

1871
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,200
First come first served.

1872
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,240
It's like a love letter.

1873
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,080
Seriously.

1874
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,600
Did you give it to me?

1875
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,560
Of course.

1876
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,000
Harry gave it to Xinxin.

1877
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,240
Why are you giving it to me?

1878
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,040
I'm inviting you.

1879
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,000
Tata gave Harry

1880
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,920
Here's your invitation card.

1881
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,480
Thank you.

1882
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
It's here.

1883
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,200
I gave it to her.
