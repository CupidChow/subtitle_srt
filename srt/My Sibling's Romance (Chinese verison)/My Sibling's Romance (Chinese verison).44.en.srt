Have you been there?

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
Xinxin.
Is Tianjin known for roujiamo?

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Roujiamo is from Xi'an.
Xinxin.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,960

I'm sorry.

Susu.
I can't believe this.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,480
Tutu.
We can go watch the old men diving.

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
But we can't see that in winter.
Tutu.

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Susu.
There are old men diving in winter too.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Really?
Tutu.

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Xiaoling.
It's actually in winter when the old men dive.

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Tutu.
That sounds fun.

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,880

We're very happy.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,040
Tutu.
Actually, what I'm looking forward to the most is

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,240
eating in Tianjin.
Tutu.

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,040
Tutu.
Enjoying the delicious food.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
They say
Tutu.

79
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
Tutu.
a trip is a test to determine

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
whether two people are compatible or not.
Tutu.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,440
I want to observe more.
Tutu.

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
Terry.
I feel we don't have much time left.

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,279
Having a trip like this
Terry.

84
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,360
is quite exciting.
Terry.

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,519
Pangpang.
My first reaction is

86
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
Because the misunderstanding between Huahua and me
Pangpang.

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
Pangpang.
was just cleared up, right?

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,280
We can use this trip to interact a bit.
Pangpang.

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,240
Pangpang.
I think a trip

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
can help us understand a person
Pangpang.

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,120
Pangpang.
in many aspects.

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
And see a person clearly.
Pangpang.

93

97
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,280

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
It's okay, you can put it in my bag.

Tata
Your backpack.

109
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,040
Xinxin
I can share with Xiaoling.

110
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,840
We can both fit in one suitcase.
Xinxin

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
Terry
Siblings can share one suitcase.

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,800

Mine.

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
But my brother won't share a suitcase with me.
Susu

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Susu
What should I do?

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Terry
Then ask your brother.

117
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
Why ask me?
Terry

118
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
Harry
We can share one suitcase.

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,200
That little purple one.
Harry

120
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,880
Isn't the blue one okay?
Harry

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Then help me with the blue suitcase first.
Susu

122
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,000
Harry
You handle it yourself.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Susu
I brought all my clothes today.

124
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Take them out for me.
Susu
I brought all my clothes today.

125
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Harry
You handle it yourself.

126
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Susu
But I still need to pack my makeup.

127
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,520
Susu
and my skincare products.

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,040
I won't share a suitcase with you.
Harry

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Yang Gen Harry must want to share a suitcase with Tata.

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,200
Zhu Dan
Right.

131
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
Susu
Are you sure?

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
Susu.
Are you sure?

133
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Harry.
Bring.

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
You can.

135
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,960
I can bring a suitcase.

Such strong big sister energy!

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,040

Come with me to pack.
Susu.

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,120
Harry.
You pack first.

141
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Susu.
Can you get it out for me first?

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,000
Harry.
Let's chat for a bit.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,880
I'll find you after we finish chatting.
Harry.

144
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,560
They're stuck together.
Jiang Dunhao.

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
Meina.
They're almost glued together.

146
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,320
Xiaoling.
Can you put it next to my bed?

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Thank you.
Xiaoling.

148
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,240
Tangtang.
Which one is your bed again?

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,400
The one by the window.
Xiaoling.

150
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
Zhu Dan.
Xiaoling has changed so much now.

151
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,800
She's become more lively, right?
Wu Zun.

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
Zhu Dan.
Now she even speaks with a cute tone.

153
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
Can you put it by the bed for me?
Zhu Dan.

154
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
She's more relaxed now.
Xiaolu.

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
Wu Zun.
We've arrived in Tianjin.

156
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Together.
We're off.

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Tangtang.
Let's go to the Tianjin Eye.

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
Pangpang.
I want to eat jianbing guozi.

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,320
We're in Tianjin now.
Tutu.

160
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Tangtang.
You've never been here before?

161
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
It's my first time here.
Terry.

162
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,120

Tata.
Have you been here before?

165
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,200
Xiaoling.
No.

166
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,040
I've only passed through.
Xiaoling.

167
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,640
Xiaoling.
How about you?

168
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,440
I haven't been here either.
Tata.

169
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Let's go.
Tangtang.

170
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,040
Harry.
Task card.

171
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
There's a task card here.
Tutu.

Yes.
Harry.

175
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Director unlocked the 'Winter Date Destination' submission event.

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Director.
Received.

177
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,480
Submissions from various romantic cities.
Director.

178
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
Director.
We finally decided to accept the recommendation.

179
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Came to Tianjin for recording.
Director.

180
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,800
Started the exciting journey.
Director.

181
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,080
Harry.
Let's take a look first.

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Tutu.
Welcome everyone to Tianjin.

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Tutu will proceed by drawing cards.
Tutu.

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,440
Choose a room.
Tutu.

185
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
Suite, what room is below this?
Harry.

186
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,680
Tutu.
Right.

187
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,440
There are two standard rooms and two suites.
Tutu.

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
Tutu.
So we need to draw cards now.

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To choose a room.
Tutu.

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Is it this one?
Harry.

191
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,680
Right.
Tutu.

192
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
Can men and women stay together?
Yang Gen.

193
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
This is too exciting!
Zhang Zining.

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,640
Xiaoling.
My first thought is,

195
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,400
Then if it's according to blind box drawing,
Xiaoling.

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
Xiaoling.
to allocate rooms,

197
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,280
then surely,
Xiaoling.

198
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,000
Xiaoling.
many different combinations will occur.

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Xiaoling, and then there might be some new sparks.
Xiaoling.

200
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,560
Pangpang.
Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
Rock, paper, scissors.
Tutu.

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Rock-paper-scissors.
Tutu.

203
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Paper.
Tutu.

204
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,000
Tutu.
He's first.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Pangpang.
First.

206
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,480
Tutu.
You're second and third.

207
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,080
You two come.
Tutu.

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,840
Pangpang.
I won't be last, I'm telling you.

209
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,240
Come on.
Tutu.

210
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
Then you have no choice.
Tata.

211
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
Terry.
That's not certain.

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
Not sure what you'll draw either.
Terry.

213
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,720
Susu.
Right.

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
Maybe the first draw is a (standard room).
Susu.

215
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,520
Terry.
Right.

216
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,440
Tata
Tutu is speechless.

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,840
The age when you can't hide things.
Tutu

218
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,560
Huahua
It's really the age when you can't hide things.

219
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Terry
If Huahua and I

220
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,160
were to draw a suite,
Terry

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,480
Terry
I'd actually be happier.

222
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,840
Meina
Two people in one suite.

223
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,600
We can really live together.
Yang Gen

224
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,240
Zhu Dan
Your show is playing it big.

225
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,640
Pangpang
Suite

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
Tutu
Next, you girls.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Huahua
Let's just draw directly, okay?

228
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,640
Go ahead, you draw.
Tata

229
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,760
Xiaolu
The god of fate won't kick us, right?

230
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,960
Huahua
At that time, I actually wanted to room with Xiaoling

231
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,200
or Xinxin.
Huahua

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Susu
I didn't think much about it.

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
I just thought, let it be.
Susu

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Susu
Whoever I draw, that's who I'll get.

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,600
Xinxin
We'll definitely be together.

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
Xinxin
What I want most is definitely

237
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,480
to live with my roommate.
Xinxin

238
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,800
After all, I'm already used to living with her.
Xinxin

239
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,080
Xiaoling
At that time, I thought

240
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
Xinxin, please.
Xiaoling

241
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Xiaoling
I'm begging.

242
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
I want to live with Xinxin.
Xiaoling

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm in standard room one.
Tutu

244
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,760
Terry
We're the same.

245
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,480
Then we'll live together.
Tutu

246
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,360
Terry
I'm quite happy to live with Tutu too.

247
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Because Huahua will often come to see him,
Terry

248
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,200
Terry
this way I can

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
have more contact with Huahua.
Terry

250
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,120
Yang Gen
He has a little scheme.

251
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,760
What about you guys?
Tutu

252
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,280
Tangtang
I'm in suite two.

253
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Pangpang
I'm

254
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,640
suite two.
Pangpang
I'm

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Susu
I'm in suite two.

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Tangtang
We're together.

257
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a bit funny.
Tangtang

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Funny.
Harry

259
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,760
Su Su
Quite satisfied.

260
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm staying in a suite.
Su Su

261
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
or sleeping alone in a king-size room.
Su Su

262
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,760
Su Su
And with the person I wanted to get close to.

263
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
in the same suite.
Su Su

264
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,080
Su Su
It feels like such a coincidence.

265
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
It's meant to be.
Su Su

266
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,840
Zhu Dan
A match made in heaven.

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,000
Tang Tang
Happy.

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Tang Tang
Although I don't know what good it will do.

269
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
but I'm happy.
Tang Tang

270
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
Pang Pang
Definitely.

271
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,120
Unhappy.
Pang Pang

272
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Pang Pang
Right.

273
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
I drew a suite at that time.
Pang Pang

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,320
Pang Pang
I thought

275
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
Pang Pang
it must be a very big room.

276
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
Pang Pang
But I didn't expect to end up there.

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
I became a big third wheel.
Pang Pang

278
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,960
Jiang Dunhao
Pang Pang

279
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,840
If I were you, I'd break the room key.
Jiang Dunhao

280
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,440
I'm in Suite One.
Ta Ta

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Xiao Ling
So we're staying together.

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
What about you?
Xiao Ling

283
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,480
Hali

284
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Su Su
Su Zihao is in Suite One.

285
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
Zhu Dan
Hali

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,240
Xiao Ling became the third wheel.
Xiao Lu

287
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,160
Ta Ta
Very surprised.

288
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,800
Because I never expected
Ta Ta

289
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,280
Ta Ta
that the room I drew would be

290
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
the one with Hali.
Ta Ta

291
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
It feels like there's something
Ta Ta

292
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
destined about it.
Ta Ta

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Hali
Because being with Ta Ta

294
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,840
makes me very happy.
Hali

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,840
Zhu Dan
Those two are so lovey-dovey.

296
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Mei Na
Like they're glued together.

297
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
Xiao Ling
I've always known my luck is bad.

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
Xiao Ling
But I didn't expect to draw

299
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
such a big third-wheel room.
Xiao Ling

300
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
Xiao Ling
Things didn't go as planned.

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,480
And I became a big third wheel.
Xiao Ling

302
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,680
Xiao Ling
Let's just say

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,400
Xiaoling.
I don't communicate much with Harry.

304
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't communicate much with Tata either.
Xiaoling.

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
Xiaoling.
Then they communicate more with each other.

306
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,840
I even share a room with them.
Xiaoling.

307
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,880
Xiaoling,
So I'm thinking,

308
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,600
what should we do?
Xiaoling,

309
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,760
Xiaolu.
And those two don't even avoid others.

310
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,840
This makes it even more
Xiaolu.

311
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
Huahua.
Biao Er.

312
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Xinxin.
The two of us, Biao Er,

313
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,560
Huahua.
I ended up drawing Xinxin.

314
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm very satisfied with this result.
Huahua.

315
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Xinxin,
The most unexpected thing is,

316
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
boys and girls can live together.
Xinxin,

317
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
Xinxin,
I always thought,

318
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,440
it would definitely be three girls, two girls,
Xinxin,

319
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
a combination like that.
Xinxin,

320
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
Xinxin.
Very surprising.

321
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I didn't expect it either.
Zhang Zining.

322
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,280
Meina.
It's so exciting.

323
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,560
Xinxin.
Here.

324
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
Not bad.
Huahua.

325
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Huahua.
Not bad.

326
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,200
Can you help me with my suitcase?
Huahua.

327
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
Huahua.
It means we're destined to share a room.

328
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,480
Xinxin.
Yes.

329
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,280
When you went to draw,
Xinxin.

330
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,560
Xinxin.
I thought we would be locked together.

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,840
Huahua.
Yes.

332
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,480
Luckily,
Huahua.

333
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Huahua.
how do we live in a suite?

334
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Luckily, it's not us.
Huahua.

335
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
Huahua.
It would be really awkward.

336
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,360
Huahua, I think this is really fate's arrangement.

337
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,840
Xinxin.
If it were me, I would die of embarrassment.

338
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Terry.
I think it's pretty good too.

339
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,720
It's okay.
Tutu.

340
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,560
Terry,
Yeah, I think this standard room compared to their suite,

341
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,600
shouldn't be much different.
Terry,

342
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,920
Much more comfortable.
Tutu.

343
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,240
And we don't have to be the third wheel.
Terry.

344
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,840
Xiaoling and that one,
Tutu.

345
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,600
Terry,
Xiaoling and Pangpang are really,

346
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Tutu.
they're really miserable.

347
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,120
Terry.
Really miserable.

348
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,680
Xiaoling.
Not bad.

349
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,760
That's great.
Xiaoling.

350
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,320
Tata.
Not bad.

351
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,400
What a coincidence.
Tata.

352
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,080
Xiaoling.
Tata.

353
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
What can I say?
Xiaoling.

354
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,200
Fate works in mysterious ways.
Xiaoling.

355
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,240
Who is Susu staying with?
Tata.

356
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,680
Susu.
Xiaoling.

357
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,640
She's with Tangtang and Pangpang.
Harry.

358
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Xiaoling.
They are too.

359
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Is it that funny?
Tata.

360
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,600
Xiaoling.
What kind of existence am I?

361
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
May I ask?
Xiaoling.

362
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Pangpang.
Let me see which one is the big bed.

363
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,720
Susu.
This one, I see it.

364
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,760
Thank you.
Susu.

365
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,560
Pangpang.
Shouldn't it be mine?

366
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,120
Thank you.
Susu.

367
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Pangpang.
Okay.

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Susu.
I'm feeling so great.

369
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,840
Looks like it's just the two of us staying here.
Tangtang.

370
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
Pangpang.
You seem upset.

371
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,000
Tangtang.
No, I'm not.

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm so happy.
Tangtang.

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Susu.
This is awesome.

374
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Tangtang.
Kick her out.

375
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,640
Pangpang.
She's gone.

376
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,120
Let's go.
Tutu.

377
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,000
let's go.
Tutu.

378
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Pangpang.
let's go downstairs.

379
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Yang Gen
We were just talking about being a third wheel.

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
Have you ever unintentionally or intentionally

381
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Yang Gen
become a third wheel in someone else's moment?

382
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,200
Xiaolu
I have.

383
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
I remember one time very clearly.
Xiaolu

384
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Xiaolu
It was by West Lake.

385
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,400
Xiaolu
We went there for a performance.

386
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,280
After the show, there were two male actors
Xiaolu

387
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
Xiaolu
who had brought their girlfriends.

388
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,200
I was single at the time.
Xiaolu

389
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,360
Xiaolu
Then as we walked along West Lake, I realized

390
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,200
there were two couples walking hand in hand in front of me,
Xiaolu

391
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,360
Xiaolu
and I was in the middle.

392
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,800
We were all maintaining
Xiaolu

393
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
Xiaolu
this hourglass shape.

394
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,800
We kept moving forward,
Xiaolu

395
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
Xiaolu
and I felt like I couldn't fit in anywhere.

396
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,480
I could only stay in the middle
Xiaolu

397
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,160
Xiaolu
and pretend

398
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
that nothing was happening in front or behind me.
Xiaolu

399
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,520
So I just admired the scenery by myself,
Xiaolu

400
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Zhu Dan
pretending to be busy.

401
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Xiaolu
Pretending I was enjoying it.

402
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
Zhang Zining, I actually never knew I was a third wheel.

403
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Zhang Zining
I always thought

404
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
everyone loved to hang out with me.
Zhang Zining

405
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,560
Zhang Zining
We all played games together.

406
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Until one time,
Zhang Zining

407
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,320
Zhang Zining
we were playing games as usual.

408
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
Then I won,
Zhang Zining

409
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,600
Zhang Zining
and I was happy by myself.

410
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
My female friend lost,
Zhang Zining

411
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,520
Zhang Zining
and she said to the person next to her,

412
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,560
Zhang Zining
'I lost, baby, look.'

413
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
Then that guy said,
Zhang Zining

414
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Zhang Zining
'Yeah, she's bad.'

415
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Zhang Zining, that's when I realized I really shouldn't be there.

416
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,360
Zhang Zining
That's when I truly understood

417
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
what being a third wheel means.
Zhang Zining

418
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
Yang Gen
I have another particularly

419
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
interesting experience.
Yang Gen

420
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Yang Gen
I organized a

421
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,320
mahjong game at home.
Yang Gen

422
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
Yang Gen
The other three were all my friends.

423
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
Then, the next time we played mahjong,
Yang Gen

424
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
Yang Gen
A and B got together.

425
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,560
And the time after that,
Yang Gen

426
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,880
Yang Gen
A and B broke up.

427
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
B and C got together.
Yang Gen

428
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
Yang Gen
I'm the only one who didn't know.

429
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Zhu Dan
You found out afterwards.

430
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,840
Yang Gen
Yes.

431
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,520
Zhu Dan
How could you?

432
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,480
I've been arranging games for these three people.
Zhu Dan

433
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,840
Xiao Lu
I can only say they really love playing mahjong.

434
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
It's already so awkward.
Xiao Lu

435
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Xiao Lu
Can't they just not play?

436
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,560
Right?
Xiao Lu

437
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,920
The main point is they came for mahjong.
Yang Gen

438
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Then your observation skills are really poor.
Wu Zun

439
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
Zhu Dan
This insensitivity is like, you know...

440
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,880
Huang Zihongfan is a bit intense.
Zhu Dan

441
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,400
Zhu Dan
You two.

442
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,040
Yang Gen
Have you guys noticed?

443
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,160
In life, you can't casually introduce potential partners.
Yang Gen

444
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,360
Yang Gen
If the match is successful, it's a beautiful thing.

445
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,080
Yang Gen
If the match fails,

446
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
Yang Gen
they'll come to you to complain.

447
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,040
Zhang Zining
If it's your request,

448
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,000
For example, if you tell me,
Zhang Zining

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,720
Zhang Zining
that person around you looks pretty good,

450
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,640
and you want me to arrange a meeting,
Zhang Zining

451
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,800
Zhang Zining
if it's proposed by them,

452
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,600
I think it's okay.
Zhang Zining

453
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,480
But I won't take the initiative to do this.
Zhang Zining

454
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Wu Zun
Maybe all your friends are still young.

455
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,800
Like our friends,
Wu Zun

456
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Wu Zun
some might already be in their thirties.

457
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
and still can't find a partner.
Wu Zun

458
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,880
They're quite eager.
Zhu Dan

459
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
Wu Zun
So we might take the initiative to introduce them to someone.

460
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,880
Right,
Wu Zun
So we might take the initiative to introduce them to someone.

461
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,400
Wu Zun
but when you're young, it doesn't matter.

462
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,520
There's still plenty of time.
Wu Zun

463
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Yes.
Zhang Zining

464
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,280
Meina
I once spent New Year's Eve

465
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,120
with three couples.
Meina

466
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,360
Zhu Dan
You're really brave.

467
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,600
Meina
I don't know.

468
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
They said, 'Nana, come celebrate New Year's Eve with us,'
Meina

469
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Meina
and then he kept sincerely inviting me.

470
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,000
After I arrived, I realized
Meina

471
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Meina
it was actually three couples.

472
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
Zhu Dan
I wanted to ask why that person invited you.

473
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,160
What was the reason?
Zhu Dan

474
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Meina
He was afraid I'd be lonely by myself.

475
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,080
That no one would accompany me for New Year's Eve.
Meina

476
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
Meina
Meina: But actually, he didn't know I'm quite popular.

477
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
Many people invited me.
Meina

478
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,680
I gave this precious opportunity
Meina

479
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
Meina
to my friend.

480
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,880
But when I arrived, it turned out to be three couples.
Meina

481
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
So you felt even lonelier.
Zhu Dan

482
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,000
Meina
And then you had to count down together.

483
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,240
'Come on, the New Year is almost here!'
Meina

484
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,200
Wu Zun
And during the countdown, they were kissing.

485
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
And you were alone,
Wu Zun

486
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Meina
watching the three couples whispering sweet nothings.

487
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,320
I just...
Meina

488
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Meina
I'll always remember this New Year's Eve.

489
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yang Gen
Because those three couples...

490
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,560
were all focused on their own love,
Yang Gen

491
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,720
Yang Gen
they needed an observer.

492
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,320
That was you.
Yang Gen

493
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Meina
I think maybe

494
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
they wanted me to host.
Meina

495
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,960
'Let's congratulate these three couples!'
Jiang Dunhao

496
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
Just thinking about it is suffocating.
Zhang Zining

497
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,000
Wu Zun
Actually, when I saw that scene just now,

498
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Wu Zun: It's like they have to sleep in the same room.

499
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,640
Wu Zun
Has anyone here slept with their parents until

500
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,200
Wu Zun
they were fourteen or fifteen?

501
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,120
Xiaolu
In the same bed?

502
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
Wu Zun
In the same room.

503
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,720
Wu Zun.
No.

504
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,920
Right next to their big bed,
Wu Zun.

505
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,200
Wu Zun.
there was a small bed underneath.

506
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
I slept on the bottom bed.
Wu Zun.

507
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,840
Zhu Dan.
Were you being a third wheel to your parents?

508
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,320
You mean...
Zhu Dan.

509
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,640
Wu Zun.
I think I was.

510
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,520
Really, thinking back now,
Wu Zun.

511
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,560
Wu Zun.
I was a huge third wheel.

512
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,320
You know what?
Wu Zun.

513
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Wu Zun.
For those 14 years,

514
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
they had no privacy.
Wu Zun.

515
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,880
Wu Zun.
And I...

516
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,120
One night,
Wu Zun.

517
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,920
I remember this very clearly.
Wu Zun.

518
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
Zhu Dan.
Are you sure we can talk about this?

519
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,000
And that we can listen to it?
Zhu Dan.

520
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
Wu Zun.
You're all 18 now, right?

521
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,560
Zhang Zining.
Go on.

522
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,760
Because they were over there,
Wu Zun.

523
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Zhu Dan.
being all lovey-dovey.

524
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,920
Wu Zun.
Sweet talking and cuddling.

525
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,120
Then I needed to go to the bathroom, I needed to pee.
Wu Zun.

526
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,840
Wu Zun.
I got nervous.

527
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080
I thought, 'What should I do?'
Wu Zun.

528
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,400
Meina.
You were afraid of making them uncomfortable too?

529
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,880
Wu Zun.
Yes.

530
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,120
So from my bed underneath,
Wu Zun.

531
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,560
You crawled over?
Zhu Dan.

532
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
Wu Zun.
I crawled.

533
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,960
Crawled to the bathroom.
Wu Zun.

534
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,280
That would be even more embarrassing if you were caught.
Meina.

535
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Wu Zun.
Even more embarrassing.

536
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
I was young at that time.
Wu Zun.

537
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Wu Zun.
I thought they might not hear me.

538
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
But when you use the bathroom,
Wu Zun.

539
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,440
Wu Zun.
they would definitely hear you...

540
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
That scene.
Meina.

541
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Wu Zun.
Then slowly crawled back.

542
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
So I'm thinking.
Wu Zun.

543
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,680
Wu Zun, I'm really a huge third wheel.

544
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,240
Xiaolu.
Many people have really done it.

545
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,160
Parents' third wheel.
Xiaolu.

546
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240
Xiaolu.
Zun's words reminded me.

547
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,680
Once when my friend was a child.
Xiaolu.

548
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,119
Xiaolu.
His parents were staying in this room.

549
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,119
He was in this room.
Xiaolu.

550
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,560
Xiaolu.
But.

551
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,160
There was a connecting window in between.
Xiaolu.

552
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,520
Xiaolu.
One time he went crazy.

553
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,840
Then he suddenly thought.
Xiaolu.

554
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
To create a surprise for his parents.
Xiaolu.

555
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
Xiaolu.
He climbed out of his own window.

556
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,840
Then slowly along this wall.
Xiaolu.

557
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Climbed to his parents' window and then.
Xiaolu.

558
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,040
Was it a surprise?
Wu Zun.

559
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,560
First time seeing parents in panic.
Xiaolu.

560
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,480
Then remembered for the first time.
Xiaolu.

561
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Xiaolu.
That my parents are also a couple.

562
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,400
Huahua.
This is really such a coincidence.

563
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,080
I think.
Huahua.

564
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,360
Huahua.
Just these two couples.

565
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,720
Xiaoling.
Right.

566
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Xinxin.
And why is Tutu sleeping with Terry?

567
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,920
I just want to see Pangpang sleeping with Terry.
Xinxin.

568
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,480
Xinxin.
Don't understand, it's really uncomfortable.

569
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
Xinxin.
Why isn't it you and Terry?

570
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
The three of you living together.
Xinxin.

571
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
Xiaoling.
I want to see this.

572
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
If that's the case.
Tata.

573
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Xinxin.
I would definitely get involved.

574
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Got goosebumps for a moment.
Susu.

575
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,680
Me too.
Tata.

576
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Xinxin.
Didn't I save you?

577
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,440
Huahua.
Yes.

578
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,840
Xinxin.
Right?

579
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Jiang Dunhao.
Really like to zoom in on faces.

580
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,640
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

581
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,320
Xinxin
To celebrate everyone's first group trip,

582
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,200
Love Siblings
Xinxin

583
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,800
Xinxin
is hereby hosting the first photography contest.

584
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,720
Please feel free to take photos at the beach,
Xinxin

585
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,040
Xinxin
capturing your siblings and their partners through your eyes.

586
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,200
Each person should submit three photos
Xinxin

587
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,760
Xinxin
as contest entries.

588
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,240
Huahua
Siblings and their partners.

589
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
This 'partner'
Xiaoling

590
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Huahua
means everyone, right?

591
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,600
We can take photos of anyone in the house then.
Huahua

592
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,240
That should be the idea.
Tata

593
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Susu
Strike a pose for me!

594
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,600
I want to win!
Susu

595
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,240
Susu
Ta

596
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,760
Xiaoling
I'll pose hard for you!

597
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,400
You want to win?
Xiaoling

598
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,640
Susu
then strike a pose for me!

599
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Are we taking photos of our siblings?
Harry

600
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Siblings and their partners.
Together

601
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,280
Then I won't take photos of my sister.
Harry

602
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,240
Pangpang
Someone else will take photos with your sister.

603
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,760
Terry
I think so too.

604
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,200
Tangtang
No, this is too difficult.

605
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
Terry
How's your photography skills?

606
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,400
Do you want me to teach you?
Terry

607
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
Tangtang
Come on, quick!

608
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,640
Terry
When taking photos, make sure to compliment her looks.

609
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,360
This looks good, right.
Terry

610
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Terry
That's it.

611
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,600
You must do it like this.
Terry
That's it.

612
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,840
Give emotional value.
Terry

613
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,480
Meina
Right, when taking photos, you should compliment her.

614
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,840
This emotional value is very important.
Meina

615
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,200
Tangtang
Zoom in the phone camera by 1.3 times.

616
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,520
Terry
Yes.

617
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Tangtang
Why?

618
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,280
Terry
It means the person will take up a larger proportion of the frame.

619
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,000
Tangtang
I need to memorize these tips.

620
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,800
Terry.
When taking photos, people should be the main focus.

621
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Tang Tang.
People are the main subject.

622
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,040
Terry.
Right.

623
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,240
Tang Tang.
People are the main subject.

624
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,880
Don't make her look short in the photo.
Tang Tang.

625
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,840
Then zoom in about three times.
Tang Tang.

626
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,160
Terry.
Were you this serious when you were studying?

627
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,760
Tang Tang.
No.

628
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,480
Otherwise, I wouldn't know how to take the photo.
Tang Tang.

629
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,520
Harry.
Just take a few more shots.

630
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,640
Then just choose the best one.
Harry.

631
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,600
This is serious learning.
Xiao Lu.

632
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,320
Mei Na.
Yes.

633
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
Terry.
Don't panic.

634
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,880
It's no big deal.
Terry.

635
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,440
Still not panicking.
Tang Tang.

636
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,320
It's not a big deal.
Harry.

637
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,600
Tang Tang.
Oh no, something's going to happen.

638
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
We've arrived at the beach.
Tu Tu.

639
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Tu Tu.
Are you confident about later?

640
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,120
No.
Xiao Ling.

641
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,440
I think we'll definitely win, I'm telling you.
Tu Tu.

642
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,640
That depends on who's taking the photo.
Xiao Ling.

643
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,680
Tu Tu.
We'll win anyway.

644
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,040
You two have the best looks.
Tu Tu.

645
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Xin Xin.
Have you learned it?

646
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,160
Don't make me look like I'm only 1.2 meters tall.
Xin Xin.

647
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,880
Pang Pang.
What should I photograph?

648
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,760
Xin Xin.
Photograph your hands and feet.

649
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,400
Pang Pang.
I'm not photographing you, I'm photographing Hua Hua.

650
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,280
Xin Xin.
You must photograph your hands and feet with them.

651
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,520
Pang Pang.
I ignored the part about hands and feet.

652
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,200
Hua Hua.
Don't take the photo.

653
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,640
That thing of yours.
Hua Hua.
Don't take the photo.

654
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,920
Hua Hua.
Forget it.

655
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,360
Pang Pang.
I'm telling you, mine has the best image quality.

656
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
Hua Hua.
I don't want to.

657
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,440
Let's go.
Xiao Ling.

658
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,600
Xin Xin.
Let's set off.

659
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,520
Be careful, everyone.
Tu Tu.

660
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
Tang Tang.
Don't twist your ankle.

661
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,800
Balance ability.
Tang Tang.

662
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,920
Tang Tang.
Can you walk on the rocky path?

663
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,800
Tang Tang
Be careful not to twist your ankle.

664
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,520
Tang Tang
Come this way, the stones are flatter here.

665
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
I might as well carry you across.
Tang Tang

666
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,600
Wu Zun
He's starting to take initiative.

667
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,360
Then carry me.
Zhang Zining

668
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Carry
Together

669
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,880
Xin Xin
Okay, I can carry you across.

670
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,440
Tang Tang
She's already halfway across.

671
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Su Su
I'm scared.

672
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
Hua Hua
Are we doing a live competition or...

673
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,280
Pang Pang
It's definitely static.

674
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,400
How could it be a live competition?
Pang Pang

675
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,080
Pang Pang
You just wish.

676
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,000
Hua Hua
Yours can't do live streaming.

677
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,680
Pang Pang
I have live streaming.

678
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,520
Who says I don't?
Pang Pang

679
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,360
Pang Pang
My phone camera is definitely better than yours.

680
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,720
Take a look yourself, is there any problem?
Pang Pang

681
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,760
Pang Pang
See for yourself how many cameras there are.

682
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,080
Four.
Pang Pang
See for yourself how many cameras there are.

683
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,960
Hua Hua
The camera even has skin smoothing.

684
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Take the photo quickly.
Hua Hua

685
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,360
Hua Hua
Hurry up.

686
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,560
Pang Pang
Smile, you don't look happy.

687
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,240
Harry
Let's find a spot.

688
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
Pang Pang
That smile looks so fake.

689
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,600
Pang Pang
Look at her smile like that.

690
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Hua Hua
Come on, I'll take a photo for you.

691
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,960
Okay.
Hua Hua

692
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,120
Yuan Bo
Hua Hua

693
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,280
Hua Hua
Brother Bo

694
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,960
The emotional value is so high.
Zhang Zining

695
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,640
Hua Hua
That thing you just did.

696
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,520
Hua Hua
Amazing.

697
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
Let's go, I'll take photos for you.
Pang Pang

698
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
Hua Hua
Where are you going?

699
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,000
Xin Xin
Hua Hua
Where are you going?

700
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,360
Pang Pang
Let's go to a place up ahead where there's no one to take photos.

701
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,360
Terry
I'll take a close-up of your face.

702
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,400
Huahua
My big face doesn't look good.

703
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,120
Let's try.
Terry

704
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,840
Huahua
I don't want to.

705
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,280
Terry
Hurry up.

706
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,640
Huahua
I don't want to.

707
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,520
If I had a big face, I'd be a supermodel.
Huahua

708
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,840
Terry
Come on.

709
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
Jiang Dunhao
Pull it over quickly.

710
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,960
Huahua
If I had a big face, I'd be a supermodel.

711
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,200
Huahua
No, not too big.

712
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,480
Huahua
Do you think it's better to smile?

713
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Or is it better not to smile?
Huahua

714
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,200
Terry
I'll adjust the exposure a bit.

715
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Let's try both smiling and not smiling.
Terry

716
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,000
Huahua

717
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,200
Wu Zun
This one is beautiful.

718
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
There are many seagulls.
Wu Zun

719
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,760
Zhu Dan
Yes, it will definitely turn out great.

720
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,000
Terry
Turn around.

721
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Terry
This is good.

722
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,680
Make the movement a bit bigger.
Terry

723
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Terry
Look happier.

724
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,000
You can bend your waist a little.
Terry

725
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,120
Terry

726
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,920
Three, two, one.
Terry

727
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,280
Huahua
It's a sure win.

728
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
Terry
I'm going to choose the photos now.

729
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,600
Huahua
My face is stiff from smiling.

730
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,120
We've captured all the seagulls.
Terry

731
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,320
We've got them all.
Terry

732
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,200
There are so many here.
Terry

733
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
Huahua
Got it.

734
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,080
Terry

735
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Terry
You sit there.

736
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,440
Terry
Aren't you afraid?

737
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,120
Huahua
I'm not afraid.

738
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,600
Terry
Not afraid.

739
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Terry
Come, sit here.

740
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,200
Put your legs outside.
Terry

741
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,720
Huahua
Do you think it looks good?

742
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Terry
It looks good.

743
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
They're all here.
Huahua

744
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,680
Really?
Terry

745
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,080
Terry
Back view.

746
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,160
The side view is good too.
Terry

747
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
Terry.
Beautiful.

748
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Perfect score.
Terry.

749
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
Terry.
Good, that works.

750
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
Terry.
What are you wearing underneath? Let me see.

751
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,400
Huahua.
It's a sweater underneath.

752
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Off-shoulder.
Huahua.
It's a sweater underneath.

753
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
Terry.
That works too.

754
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,320
Show a little.
Huahua.

755
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,040
Terry.
This side is absolutely gorgeous.

756
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,880
It's truly stunning.
Terry.

757
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,120
Huahua.
Gorgeous. So, did we win?

758
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,040
Terry.
It's much better than the previous one.

759
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
Terry.
Look back.

760
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,080
Smile.
Terry.

761
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
This angle should look really good for photos.
Xiaolu.

762
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
Meina.
A woman destined to take great photos throughout her life.

763
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,920
Zhang Zining.
So beautiful.

764
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Huahua.
Gives off a feeling of looking down on everything.

765
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,560
Huahua.
Terry, international supermodel.

766
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
It's true, her fashion sense relies entirely on her face.
Xiaolu.

767
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,680
Terry.
Not bad.

768
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
I told you this side looks good, right?
Terry.

769
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Terry.
Shall we go down and check on Tang Tang and the others?

770
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,640
Let's go.
Huahua.

771
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,440
Terry.
Are they in front?

772
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,000
Huahua.
You say, 'Princess, please disembark.'

773
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,240
Terry.
Are you getting off?

774
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
Huahua.
Princess, please descend the stairs.

775
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Is that a seagull's call?
Terry.

776
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,160
Huahua.
Isn't that what they're saying?

777
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,280
Is that a seagull's call?
Terry.

778
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,680
Let me take a photo for you first.
Harry.

779
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,080
Look at me.
Harry.

780
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
It's really beautiful, to be honest.
Harry.

781
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,720
Hurry.
Harry.

782
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,040
I don't know how to take photos.
Tata.

783
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,880
Let me show you.
Harry.

784
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,160
Choose a few.
Harry.

785
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Harry.
You don't need to delete any.

786
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,560
I can see even if you delete them.
Harry.

787
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,800
Tata.
Delete it.

788
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,200
Zhu Dan.
Look at their intimate gestures quickly.

789
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
Zhang Zining
Their styles are completely different.

790
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Meina
I literally got goosebumps.

791
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,720
Hali
I think it's an angle that makes you look fat.

792
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
I definitely didn't take that.
Hali

793
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,120
Idiot.
Hali

794
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,080
Tata
You're so annoying.

795
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,160
Hali
Let's change locations.

796
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,360
Okay.
Tata

797
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,760
Look at me.
Hali

798
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,320
Hali
Can you get a...

799
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
...angle that makes me look slimmer?
Hali

800
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,680
Tata
Don't go down.

801
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,960
Don't go down, come up a bit.
Tata

802
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
Tata
Turn to the side a bit more towards me.

803
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,880
Turn your body to the side a bit.
Tata

804
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,640
Hali
That angle just now.

805
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Look over there.
Hali

806
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,960
Bro, I really think it looks good.
Hali

807
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,520
These two already feel like they're on their honeymoon.
Yang Gen

808
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Zhu Dan
Really.

809
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,280
Look, next to them...
Zhu Dan

810
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
Zhu Dan
...it's like there's no one else around.

811
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,760
This is their world.
Zhu Dan

812
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Tutu
Just be cool.

813
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,680
Right.
Tutu

814
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
Xiaoling
Don't step in a hole.

815
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,360
Tutu
I won't.

816
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,360
Tutu
Good.

817
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
Look over there, yes.
Tutu

818
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,840
What a magnificent face.
Tutu

819
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,960
Zhu Dan
Good, that's a great phrase.

820
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,880
What a magnificent face.
Zhu Dan

821
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,560
The emotional value of this...
Xiaolu

822
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
Xiaoling
I broke character.

823
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,040
Tutu
Okay, wait a moment.

824
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,880
Let me try again.
Tutu

825
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,640
Tutu
Keep looking over there, yes.

826
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,280
Zhu Dan
Xiaoling is also very beautiful.

827
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,560
It looks great.
Tutu

828
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,760
Tutu
Good.

829
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
It looks fantastic.
Tutu

830
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,560
Meina
I think she looks like a supermodel no matter how you photograph her.

831
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,240
Very good.
Tutu

832
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm telling you, it's a sure win.
Tutu.

833
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
Xiaoling.
I think my left side is ugly.

834
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,760
It looks very nice.
Tutu.

835
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,200
In the eyes of a lover, you're the most beautiful.
Zhang Zining.

836
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
Okay, see for yourself.
Tutu.

837
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,440
Xiaoling.
Why is it in black and white?

838
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,280
Tutu.
Yes, this look really suits your face.

839
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,440
this black and white feeling.
Tutu.

840
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,720
Tutu.
Because, believe it or not,

841
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,760
Tutu, they definitely all shoot in these vibrant colors.
Tutu.

842
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,560
Come on, let's continue.
Tutu.

843
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,440
Xiaoling.
Let me take the photo for you.

844
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,400
Come on.
Tutu.

845
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,120
I'll think of something.
Tutu.

846
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,280
I'll pretend to feed them.
Tutu.

847
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,920
Xiaoling.
Okay.

848
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,120
Xiaoling.
I'm dying of laughter.

849
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Zhu Dan.
So goofy.

850
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,480
Jiang Dunhao.
It's well-designed.

851
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,640
Zhu Dan.
Right.

852
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Xiaoling.
Three, two.

853
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
Xiaoling.
Three, two, one.

854
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,960
Can one come and eat from you?
Xiaoling.

855
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
No one's coming.
Tutu.

856
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,840
Xiaoling.
Don't fall down.

857
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,880
Move up a bit.
Xiaoling.

858
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,640
Xiaoling.
Right.

859
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,800
Meina.
Tutu really has a youthful vibe.

860
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,560
Xiaoling.
Impressive, Wang Jieyu.

861
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,760
Xiaoling.
How can you be so good-looking?

862
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,320
Xiaoling.
Your smile is so bright.

863
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,200
Zhu Dan.
The two of them.

864
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,920
Actually, there are more and more reactions, aren't there?
Zhu Dan.

865
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Yang Gen.
Always providing each other with

866
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,880
positive emotional value.
Yang Gen.

867
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,960
Let's go, let's walk that way.
Tutu.

868
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,520
Let's go.
Xiaoling.

869
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,480
Tutu.
Let's go over there.

870
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,640
The seagulls are all over here.
Tutu.

871
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,880
Xiaoling.
Tutu.

872
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Come over here.
Tutu.

873
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,160
Zhang Zining.
That kind of sunny energy from Tutu.

874
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,280
has been giving it to Xiaoling.
Zhang Zining.

875
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,760
So Xiaoling has become more lively too.
Wu Zun.

876
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,160
Zhang Zining.
Yes.

877
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,520
Right?
Wu Zun.

878
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,640
Zhang Zining.
she's become more cheerful.

879
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Tutu.
Enter the frame.

880
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
Xinxin.
You need to zoom in, about 1.4 times.

881
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,360
Pangpang.
It's a sure win.

882
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,320
Pangpang.
Trust me.

883
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,000
Pangpang.
Look here.

884
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,800
It's a sure win.
Pangpang.

885
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Pangpang.
I'm sorry.

886
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,840
I pressed the video button.
Pangpang.

887
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,800
Pangpang.
Is this the feeling?

888
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,720
Xinxin.
Yes, that's exactly what we want.

889
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,680
Take a few more shots.
Xinxin.

890
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,560
Just focus on taking a few good ones.
Xinxin.

891
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,600
Xinxin.
I can choose one out of twenty.

892
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Pangpang.
Turn around and smile.

893
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:41,920
Xinxin.
Yes.

894
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,040
Pangpang.
Bring that out.

895
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,360
Pangpang.
Okay, turn around.

896
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
Turn back again.
Pangpang.

897
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,360
Turn around.
Pangpang.

898
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,960
Pangpang.
Turn back, look up, and smile at me.

899
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,240
Pangpang.
Perfect.

900
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,960
Pangpang.
Look here, look up.

901
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,360
Look up, a little towards me.
Pangpang.

902
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
Pangpang.
I think you look good no matter what.

903
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
Pangpang.

904
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,080
Xiaolu.
Actually, when it comes to taking photos,

905
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,840
the person taking your photo
Xiaolu.

906
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,160
giving you a sense of security is very important.
Xiaolu.

907
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,920
Xiaolu.
Because when a stranger takes your photo,

908
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,640
you always
Xiaolu.

909
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,240
Right, you can't relax.
Zhu Dan.

910
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,920
Xiaolu.
Yes.

911
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,840
Xinxin.
It's all up to my face to carry it.

912
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,960
Pangpang.
Aren't you going to take a photo for me?

913
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
Xinxin.
It's all up to my face to carry it.

914
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,600
Your sister really looks like this for you.
Xinxin.

915
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,480
Pangpang.
Aren't you going to take one for me?

916
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,280
Xinxin.
After I take your photo,

917
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
you'll feel very uncomfortable.
Xinxin.

918
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Pangpang.
Why?

919
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,800
Xinxin.
Because you'll feel that

920
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,560
it's not the sea's fault.
Xinxin.

921
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,960
Xinxin.
Give me a

922
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
Come here and look at the front view.
Xinxin.

923
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,960
Xinxin.
Let's take it together.

924
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,560
This one is good.
Xinxin.

925
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,080
Xinxin.
Okay.

926
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,440
Susu.
Does it look good?

927
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,160
How about taking off the white clothes?
Tangtang.

928
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,240
Susu.
Okay.

929
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,880
Tangtang.
Are you cold?

930
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,520
Susu.
I'm not cold.

931
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,760
Susu.
But then, I'll take it off.

932
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,720
Tangtang.
I'll hold it for you.

933
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,120
Susu.
Don't fall down.

934
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Susu.
What are you laughing at?

935
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Tangtang.
I'm a bit scared to take the photo.

936
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,440
Susu.
It's okay.

937
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,360
Tangtang.
One point three (times).

938
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,840
Tangtang.
I think it looks pretty good anyway.

939
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,640
If you think it doesn't look good,
Tangtang.

940
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,120
Susu.
take more photos.

941
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
Just take many, many photos.
Susu.

942
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,680
Susu, I think there will definitely be one that looks a bit better.

943
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,360
Tangtang.

944
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,080
Zhu Dan.
Susu really knows how to guide Tangtang.

945
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,920
Just take many, many photos.
Zhu Dan.

946
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,720
This way, there will always be some good ones.
Zhu Dan.

947
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,520
Xiaolu.
Also praising.

948
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,200
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

949
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,560
Just to relieve the pressure.
Zhu Dan.

950
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,600
Tangtang.
It looks so good.

951
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
Tangtang.
Maybe it's because you're good-looking.

952
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,160
Thank you.
Susu.

953
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Tangtang.
Don't come over.

954
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,400
This is my phone.
Susu.

955
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,520
Tangtang.
Okay, it's fine.

956
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,480
Go back quickly.
Tangtang.

957
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,560
Tang Tang.
Actually, I'm a bit nervous.

958
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,360
Because...
Tang Tang.

959
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,680
Tang Tang.
If I don't take good photos for the girl...

960
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,560
It might...
Tang Tang.

961
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,080
Tang Tang.
The girl might get upset or something.

962
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,360
So, with a nervous feeling...
Tang Tang.

963
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,560
Tang Tang, I've been trying hard to take better photos for her.

964
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,280
Jiang Dunhao.
Busy chatting, do not disturb.

965
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,360
Su Su.
Forget it.

966
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Su Su.
I'll help you find a nice spot first.

967
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,080
Then I'll stand there.
Su Su.

968
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,000
Tang Tang.
Are you sure?

969
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,520
Su Su.
Yes.

970
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Do you want this angle?
Tang Tang.

971
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,600
Su Su.
Yes.

972
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
Tang Tang.
I've learned something.

973
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,360
Su Su.
Let's take another one.

974
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,240
Tang Tang.
One more.

975
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,480
This is so beautiful.
Zhu Dan.

976
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,720
Beautiful.
Wu Zun.

977
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,400
Tang Tang.
What should I do?

978
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Whatever you like.
Tang Tang.

979
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,680
Just do whatever, just move.

980
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,640
Action.
Tang Tang.

981
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
Su Su.
Don't move too fast.

982
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,680
Tang Tang.
I don't know how to move.

983
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,920
Su Su.
Don't look at me.

984
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,200
Okay.
Tang Tang.

985
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Su Su.
Can you look over there?

986
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
Su Su.
Don't be so nervous.

987
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,080
Su Su.
Don't suddenly look at me.

988
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
Just hold a pose...
Su Su.

989
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,200
Su Su.
For a bit longer.

990
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,720
Okay.
Tang Tang.

991
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,200
Tang Tang.
What? Have you found a good angle?

992
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
Su Su.
No, I'm taking a selfie.

993
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,560
Let's go.
Su Su.

994
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,760
Tang Tang.
Let's walk forward and find some seagulls.

995
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,400
Xiao Lu.
This is a perfect scene for suddenly...

996
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,240
A happy hand-holding scene.
Xiao Lu.

997
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,480
Tang Tang.
Wait a moment, or...

998
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
Su Su.
Dangerous.

999
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
Be careful.
Su Su.

1000
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,920
Tang Tang
I want to sit here for a while.

1001
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,480
Su Su
Sit.

1002
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,280
Tang Tang
Don't fall off.

1003
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,400
There's sunlight here.
Su Su

1004
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Su Su
there's a beam of light.

1005
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,400
Yang Gen
Move a little closer.

1006
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,200
Tang Tang
We might have had some disagreements in the past few days.

1007
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,040
Let's find a place to sit for a while.
Tang Tang

1008
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,720
Tang Tang
it might allow us to

1009
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,800
reach a calmer place in our hearts.
Tang Tang

1010
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,680
make us feel more at ease.
Tang Tang

1011
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,480
Tang Tang
Like instant noodles.

1012
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
Su Su
Your dyed hair

1013
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,000
Tang Tang
is fading.

1014
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
Su Su
I like black hair.

1015
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,520
Tang Tang
What?

1016
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,480
Su Su
I like black hair.

1017
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,280
Tang Tang
Dye it back.

1018
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Zhang Zining
It looks good together.

1019
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,680
Mei Na
It really matches well.

1020
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,600
The more I look, the better it matches.
Mei Na

1021
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
Tang Tang
I feel this angle doesn't look good.

1022
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,200
Su Su
Who doesn't look good?

1023
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
Is it you who doesn't look good or me?
Su Su

1024
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,760
Tang Tang
Do you look good?

1025
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,280
Su Su
I can't see clearly.

1026
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Su Su
I'm okay.

1027
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,800
Su Su
Look, it's pink.

1028
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,560
Su Su
It's pink.

1029
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,720
Tang Tang
The phone should be able to capture it.

1030
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,040
Su Su
That day was foggy.

1031
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,720
I found that the sea was blue.
Su Su

1032
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,240
Su Su: And then the sky was pink and purple.

1033
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,560
Su Su
It felt especially blissful.

1034
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
And I was also very happy.
Su Su

1035
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,120
Zhu Dan
Their body language

1036
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,560
Their bodies are getting closer and closer.
Zhu Dan

1037
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
Jiang Dunhao
It's sweet.

1038
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,880
Tang Tang
Jump down.

1039
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,160
Tang Tang
You need to go from here.

1040
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,400
Foreigner.

1041
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,680
Tang Tang
I'm from Xinjiang.

1042
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
Tall, rich, and handsome.

1043
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,840
Wait a moment.
Tang Tang

1044
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,840
Tang Tang
Are you stuck up there?

1045
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,160
That's more like it.
Zhang Zining

1046
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,440
Meina
Finally, there's some physical contact.

1047
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,240
Susu
Is he a foreigner?

1048
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
So handsome.
Susu

1049
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Wu Zun
Don't let go.

1050
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Meina
This shows boyfriend material.

1051
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,080
Just this once.
Meina

1052
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,720
Susu
Are you cold?

1053
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,960
Susu
I'm wearing more than you.

1054
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Terry
What are you doing?

1055
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,360
Tang Tang
What?

1056
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,120
Huahua
What are you doing?

1057
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,560
Tang Tang
It's a bit cold.

1058
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,520
Susu
It's too cold.

1059
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,159
Tang Tang
It's a bit cold.

1060
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,920
It's so embarrassing to watch.
Tutu

1061
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,080
Pangpang
They finally managed to hold hands.

1062
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,000
You really are something.
Pangpang

1063
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,120
Yang Gen
I think Tang Tang has finally figured it out.

1064
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,600
Susu
The first time holding hands is usually quite natural.

1065
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,199
No one asked, 'Can I hold your hand?'
Susu

1066
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,400
Susu
That kind of talk.

1067
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,600
It's like he finally took the initiative.
Susu

1068
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,760
He took a step forward.
Susu

1069
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,960
Wu Zun
This is the charm of traveling.

1070
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,280
The mood is different now.
Wu Zun

1071
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,600
Everyone has loosened up.
Wu Zun

1072
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,239
Tang Tang
Happy.

1073
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,800
Tang Tang
Very nervous.

1074
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,120
Tang Tang
My heart is racing.

1075
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Tang Tang
I feel out of breath.

1076
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,040
Tang Tang
My heart keeps pounding.

1077
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
Tang Tang
In my mind,

1078
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,560
Tang Tang
if I hold hands with someone,

1079
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,080
it means
Tang Tang

1080
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,679
Tang Tang
that I want to

1081
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,200
have a good relationship with her.
Tang Tang

1082
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
Tang Tang
I can finally

1083
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
put my anxious feelings to rest.
Tang Tang

1084
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,360
Holding hands means we've confirmed our relationship.
Tang Tang

1085
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,920
Zhu Dan
I won't let go.

1086
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,640
Xiaolu
So natural.

1087
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
Xiaolu
Auntie's smile.

1088
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,480
Meina
First time holding hands.

1089
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,720
How did the photos turn out?
Tutu

1090
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Xiaoling
Let me take a couple of photos for you.

1091
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Let me submit an assignment.
Xiaoling

1092
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,520
Tangtang
Is that so?

1093
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,480
You're so cold.
Tangtang

1094
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Susu
Take a couple of photos for me.

1095
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,840
Let me submit an assignment.
Susu

1096
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,600
So handsome.
Tutu

1097
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,080
Too handsome.
Tutu

1098
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,240
Susu
Let me see.

1099
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,920
Tangtang
Bro,

1100
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,440
So that's how emotional value is given.
Tangtang

1101
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
Tangtang
I should have shouted too just now.

1102
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,640
Quick, go over there.
Tangtang

1103
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,320
Let me submit an assignment.
Tangtang

1104
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,200
Tangtang
How are you so good-looking?

1105
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,960
Xiaoling
Nonsense.

1106
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,320
Tangtang
To be honest, I don't really want to take photos anymore.

1107
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,680
Terry
Tutu is teaching Tangtang how to take photos.

1108
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,480
Tutu
I want to take photos for you.

1109
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,400
I need to submit photos.
Tutu

1110
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,320
I need to complete my task. Let me take a few photos for you.
Tutu

1111
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,880
Huahua
Come on.

1112
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,280
Huahua
We can't let them succeed.

1113
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,360
We can't let them take good-looking photos.
Huahua

1114
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,720
Terry
Guess what I'm doing.

1115
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,600
Huahua
Recording a video.

1116
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Terry
I'm zooming in.

1117
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,160
Pangpang
Come on, let's take a photo.

1118
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,160
Pangpang invites Huahua to take a photo.
Meina

1119
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,120
Terry
Show him our seagull photo.

1120
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:28,960
Huahua
Take a look.

1121
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,840
Xiaoling
It's edited, right?

1122
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,920
Huahua
Take a look.

1123
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,960
Xiaoling
It's edited, right?

1124
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,760
Xinxin
It looks really good.

1125
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,080
He Wenjie, take a look.
Xinxin

1126
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,600
Pangpang
What is it?

1127
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,640
Xinxin
Take a look.

1128
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Huahua
He's so busy.

1129
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
Let's go, Xinxin.
Pangpang

1130
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Pangpang.
Hurry up, take a photo.

1131
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,480
Are you going to take it or not?
Pangpang.

1132
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,160
Huahua.
Hurry up.

1133
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,960
Huahua.
Come on, hurry up.

1134
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,200
Hurry up.
Huahua.

1135
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680
Wu Zun.
Look, she's even rushing Pangpang to take photos.

1136
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm going to find Terry now. Hurry up.
Wu Zun.

1137
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Zhu Dan.
That's just how they communicate.

1138
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
Xiaoling.
There are so many seagulls here.

1139
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,280
Let's go feed the seagulls.
Xiaoling.

1140
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,560
Terry.
So many seagulls.

1141
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
Huahua.
You're drinking in broad daylight?

1142
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,120
Tata.
With this breeze, we've got to have some drinks.

1143
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,120
Xinxin.
I have some too.

1144
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,240
Huahua.
Who else brought Fruit Cube?

1145
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,080
I want some too.
Huahua.

1146
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,200
Terry.
Today, let's drink and play without holding back.

1147
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
Plenty of Fruit Cube to go around.
Terry.

1148
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
Xiaoling.
Can you get me a white grape one?

1149
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,160
I want this one.
Tutu.

1150
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,520
Zhang Zining.
There's a mahjong set inside.

1151
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,480
Thank you.
Tata.

1152
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
Huahua.
Here you go.

1153
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,840
I want a special mix.
Huahua.

1154
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,440
Terry.
Do you want a special mix?

1155
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,760
Huahua.
I want a special mix.

1156
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Mu Chun.
It feels perfect for drinking anytime, anywhere.

1157
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,440
Xiaoling.
Impressive.

1158
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,160
Terry.
Here it comes.

1159
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,120
Thank you.
Huahua.

1160
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,920
Huahua.
Let's have a toast together.

1161
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,560
All together.
Cheers!

1162
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,800
Let's go wild together.
All together.

1163
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,120
All together.
Enjoy the world.

1164
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,360
Awesome.
Zhu Dan.

1165
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,720
Xiaolu.
So happy.

1166
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,120
So high.
Tata.

1167
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,920
Hali.

1168
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,600
Meina.
They were just drinking by the seaside.

1169
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
They really drank wildly and freely.
Meina.

1170
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,640
Yang Gen.
HAVE C, right.

1171
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,400
Watching them mix drinks makes me want to shake it too.

1172
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,840
Look, just shake it like this, Guo Lifang.

1173
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
It's actually quite fun.

1174
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,320
Jiang Dunhao, watching makes me want to rush to the curb too.

1175
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,160
Let's have a drink.

1176
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,400
Xiaolu.
Then you can make that Guo Ligang.

1177
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,440
Just drink 'ton ton ton' when you see someone.
Xiaolu.

1178
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,400
Drink 'ton ton ton'.

1179
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
Dundun drinks 'ton ton'.

1180
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,800
My drinking capacity.

1181
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,560
Let's start with the small bottles.

1182
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:44,920
Come on.

1183
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Let's have a toast.

1184
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,320
Cheers.
Together.

1185
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,880
Xiaoling.
Get in the car.

1186
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,840
Okay, let's go quickly.
Tutu.

1187
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
How did the photos turn out today?
Harry.

1188
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Superb.
Huahua.

1189
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,200
Really?

1190
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,320
Absolutely beautiful, I'm telling you.

1191
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,840
Because Terry can be photographed anytime.

1192
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,200
I just need to wait for the seagulls to come over.

1193
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,360
Then I'm good.

1194
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,680
Tata.
Why don't I have any seagulls?

1195
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,480
No.

1196
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:05,920
I took over two hundred photos.

1197
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,720
It's impossible not to have a single seagull in them.

1198
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,520
I'm telling you.

1199
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
There aren't any big seagulls.

1200
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,720
Big seagulls.

1201
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,120
There are small seagulls.

1202
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
Xinxin.
How come you all have seagulls? I'm so envious.

1203
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,040
Found them on purpose.

1204
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,000
I only have one face.

1205
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,360
Pangpang.
Your face is enough, you don't need seagulls.

1206
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,320
The main thing is we don't have the vibe.

1207
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,200
They all have the vibe.

1208
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,640
Enough, just be beautiful.

1209
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,160
No need.

1210
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,440
Let me put it on you.

1211
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,120
Afraid you'll get cold.

1212
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Zhu Dan.
They're already in the honeymoon phase.

1213
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,280
Meina.
Listening to music together is very romantic.

1214
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,000
Susu,
playing hand slapping.

1215
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,840
Susu,
use that hand.

1216
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,160
Susu,
have you played before?

1217
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,440
Tangtang,
no, why did you stand up?

1218
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,920
there's even a charge-up here.
Tangtang,

1219
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
it feels like a campus romance.
Xiaolu,

1220
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,720
Susu,
so loud.

1221
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,480
Zhu Dan.
you're playing with a professional table tennis player.

1222
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,840
testing reaction speed.
Zhu Dan.

1223
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,120
Susu,
can't always fake, it's not fun.

1224
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,520
Susu,
this place is too small.

1225
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,480
hold it higher.
Susu,

1226
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,440
Tangtang,
you go.

1227
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,400
Tangtang,
what are you doing? I'm not ready.

1228
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,200
playing this with someone who practices table tennis.
Tangtang,

1229
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
Jiang Dunhao.
such a sweet couple.

1230
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,520
Zhang Zining.
sweet.

1231
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,800
so sweet it's almost too much.
Zhang Zining.

1232
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,080
Yang Gen: this would be the most beautiful stage of dating.

1233
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,600
Zhang Zining,
yes.

1234
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
Yang Gen,
you'll find that during the passionate stage of love,

1235
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,320
Yang Gen,
or at the beginning stage,

1236
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,880
Yang Gen,
even if two people are playing hand slapping,

1237
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
such a childish thing,
Yang Gen,

1238
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,320
Yang Gen,
they can keep playing.

1239
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,000
in your previous dating stages,
Yang Gen,

1240
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,320
Yang Gen,
have you done anything

1241
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,640
childish with your partner?
Yang Gen,

1242
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,000
Xiaolu: my husband has a very childish habit.

1243
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,160
Xiaolu,
for example, when we're in a crowd,

1244
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,640
everyone is sitting and chatting,
Xiaolu,

1245
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,520
Xiaolu,
and suddenly if we make eye contact,

1246
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
he will just stare at me.
Xiaolu,

1247
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,320
Xiaolu
He starts to cross his eyes.

1248
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,680
every time I feel like an idiot.
Xiaolu

1249
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Xiaolu
But I tell him not to do that.

1250
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,760
Then he would do this.
Xiaolu

1251
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,160
Xiaolu, and sometimes when I turn my head and see him,

1252
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,640
Xiaolu
he also

1253
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
even when it's just the two of us at home, he starts doing this.
Xiaolu

1254
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,520
Xiaolu
I say, 'Don't do that anymore.'

1255
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,280
He just thinks it's funny.
Xiaolu

1256
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,000
He's teasing you.
Zhang Zining

1257
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,920
Zhu Dan
But your reaction

1258
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,080
is also part of what he's expecting.
Zhu Dan

1259
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,600
Xiaolu
Yes.

1260
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,960
Zhu Dan
So he never gets tired of it.

1261
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,920
Xiaolu
Right.

1262
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,400
Zhu Dan
My husband and I are quite childish.

1263
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,000
Just now with my husband,
Zhu Dan

1264
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
Zhu Dan
something very childish happened.

1265
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,120
Because I'm working and he's in Beijing,
Zhu Dan

1266
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,320
Zhu Dan
we video chat.

1267
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,400
At that time, I was putting on false eyelashes,
Zhu Dan

1268
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,320
Zhu Dan
and in the video,

1269
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
he saw my eyes like this.
Zhu Dan

1270
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,200
Zhu Dan
He was very childish,

1271
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,120
and started taking screenshots.
Zhu Dan

1272
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,560
Because in the video, you can see

1273
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
Zhu Dan
when the other person's screen suddenly freezes.

1274
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,720
Zhu Dan
He was taking screenshots.

1275
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,240
I knew it.
Zhu Dan

1276
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,080
Then he happily said,
Zhu Dan

1277
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,640
'Zhu Dan, I caught you at a particularly ugly angle.'

1278
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,200
And the next sentence was,
Zhu Dan

1279
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,040
Zhu Dan
'Oh no,'

1280
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,360
'I forgot to manage my own expression.'
Zhu Dan

1281
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,160
Zhu Dan
'I look ugly too.'

1282
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,000
Xiaolu
He must have been like this.

1283
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,080
Zhu Dan
Yes.

1284
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,560
Because he was so pleased, you know?
Zhu Dan

1285
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,000
Zhu Dan
He didn't even control his own expression.

1286
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,480
His expression was also very strange.
Zhu Dan

1287
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,360
Zhu Dan
But at that time, I thought he was

1288
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,200
really childish.
Zhu Dan

1289
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,720
Zhu Dan
You must be quite a childish person, right?

1290
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,720
Wu Zun
Something I did that was quite childish in the past.

1291
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,600
It was when I went to study in Australia.
Wu Zun

1292
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,680
Wu Zun
At that time, because she didn't go with me,

1293
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,200
we used to communicate by writing letters.
Wu Zun

1294
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,480
Wu Zun
You know, sending letters.

1295
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,400
I was in Australia then,
Wu Zun

1296
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,080
and I would often cry, tears flowing.
Wu Zun

1297
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,920
Because I missed them.
Wu Zun

1298
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,720
Wu Zun
Yes, I missed my parents and her.

1299
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,520
Then I would take the tissues I cried into,
Wu Zun

1300
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,640
and put them in the letter to send to her every time.
Wu Zun

1301
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
Wu Zun
Yes, isn't that a bit childish?

1302
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,160
Right?
Wu Zun

1303
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,360
This is a bit like a Chiung Yao drama.
Yang Gen

1304
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,000
Zhu Dan
Yes.

1305
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,120
It's not childish.
Zhu Dan

1306
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,560
Xiao Lu
Then every time the courier

1307
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,280
arrives at your girlfriend's house saying, 'Your package,'
Xiao Lu

1308
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Xiao Lu
and it's such a big package.

1309
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,120
Your girlfriend has to
Xiao Lu

1310
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,880
carry all these tissues from you.
Xiao Lu

1311
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,600
Wu Zun
Yes, I don't know why

1312
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,040
I would do such things back then.
Wu Zun

1313
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,360
And she's received them until now.
Wu Zun

1314
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes.
Wu Zun

1315
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,960
Wu Zun, I wonder if those tissues have molded.

1316
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,520
This is truly on the same wavelength.
Zhang Zining

1317
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,640
This is too awesome, too much like a Chiung Yao drama, isn't it?
Mei Na

1318
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,880
Mei Na, this is truly the ultimate part of romance.

1319
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,120
Jiang Dunhao
I just saw them high-five,

1320
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,640
and it reminded me of when we were younger,
Jiang Dunhao

1321
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,200
Jiang Dunhao
we would often imitate each other's way of speaking.

1322
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
You know, in that annoying way.
Jiang Dunhao

1323
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Jiang Dunhao
For example, if one person says, 'What are you doing?'

1324
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,520
The other would reply, 'What are YOU doing?'
Jiang Dunhao

1325
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,520
Jiang Dunhao
I think it's quite childish looking back now.

1326
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,320
Yang Gen
Yes, but with your face paired with this behavior,

1327
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,360
it doesn't feel cringy.
Yang Gen

1328
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,480
It's very cute.
Xiao Lu

1329
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,400
It still depends on the person.
Jiang Dunhao

1330
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,400
Zhang Zining
I'm super childish.

1331
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,920
I'm inherently a very childish person.
Zhang Zining

1332
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,520
I can see that.
Wu Zun

1333
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,240
Zhang Zining
I talk back.

1334
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,640
Like, whatever you ask me,
Zhang Zining

1335
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,040
Zhang Zining

1336
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,680
Zhang Zining
I just don't want to.

1337
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,160
No way.
Zhang Zining

1338
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,640
Zhang Zining
Not allowed.

1339
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,320
Jiang Dunhao
acting coy

1340
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,360
Zhang Zining
Yes, and then we might do some

1341
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,000
meaningless competitions
Zhang Zining

1342
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,960
Zhang Zining
without any stakes.

1343
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,880
It's just about competing,
Zhang Zining

1344
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Zhang Zining
and both of us take it so seriously.

1345
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,240
Zhu Dan
I can understand that point.

1346
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,720
We've had instances of racing to the bathroom at home.
Zhu Dan

1347
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,240
Really?
Zhang Zining

1348
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,160
Zhu Dan
It's just so random.

1349
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,040
I just sense he's about to go to the bathroom,
Zhu Dan

1350
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,000
Zhu Dan
and I suddenly rush ahead of him.

1351
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Actually, I don't even need to go anymore,
Zhu Dan

1352
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,520
Zhang Zining
but I still do it.

1353
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,240
Xiaolu is just walking normally to the bathroom, and then you suddenly
Xiaolu

1354
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,000
I even sit on the toilet.
Zhu Dan

1355
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,400
That's pretty funny.
Xiaolu

1356
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,520
Meina
I think I'm okay.

1357
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,360
It's not that childish.
Meina

1358
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,720
Meina
Let me think.

1359
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,880
One person would draw
Meina

1360
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,240
Meina
cartoon images of both of us.

1361
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,480
Then I would color them in.
Meina

1362
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,320
That's called romance.
Zhu Dan

1363
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,480
This isn't childish.
Wu Zun

1364
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,520
Yang Gen
You're a mature woman.

1365
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,000
Yang Gen
I see.

1366
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,920
Meina
A Leo woman from Northeast China.

1367
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,440
Zhu Dan
It's okay.

1368
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,040
After a Leo meets the right person,
Zhu Dan

1369
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Zhu Dan
they'll gradually change.

1370
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,440
I used to be a typical Leo too.
Zhu Dan

1371
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,080
I feel I'm becoming less and less like one now.
Zhu Dan

1372
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,000
You're already racing to the bathroom.
Xiaolu

1373
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,520
Zhu Dan
Right.

1374
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,240
Pangpang
We've arrived.

1375
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,640
Huahua
Goubuli VIP Building

1376
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,800
Goubuli
Together

1377
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,280
Huahua
Time to eat.

1378
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,120
I'm craving for some steamed buns now.
Xiaolu

1379
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,360
Xiaolu
This feels like meeting the parents.

1380
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,320
A restaurant like this
Xiaolu

1381
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,840
Huahua
Sit here.

1382
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,880
Terry
You sit here.

1383
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,600
Huahua
I don't want to sit in the main seat.

1384
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,240
How do you sit in this seat?
Pangpang

1385
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,360
This is the main seat.
Xiaoling

1386
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,960
Terry
The main seat

1387
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,920
Meina
The main seat

1388
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,840
Zhang Zining
The one in the main seat treats.

1389
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,360
Pangpang
Since you're all so shy

1390
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,400
let me do it.
Pangpang

1391
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,000
Huahua
It was originally reserved for Tutu, but you insisted on sitting there.

1392
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:56,960
Huahua
No.

1393
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,720
Just kidding.
Huahua

1394
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,240
Xinxin
Tutu, sit here.

1395
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,360
Zhang Zining
It's stuck again.

1396
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,640
This seat looks so familiar.
Zhang Zining

1397
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,360
The mysterious triangular seat
Yang Gen

1398
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,480
Pangpang
Come on, boss, please.

1399
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,240
Xinxin
Hello.

1400
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Xiaoling
You should sit in the main seat.

1401
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,360
I'll sit here.
Tutu

1402
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,360
I'll sit here.
Tutu

1403
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,840
Here.
Tutu

1404
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,080
Huahua
Look at the beautiful ladies on your left and right.

1405
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
This is a bit
Tutu

1406
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,080
I'm too honored.
Tutu

1407
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,680
Xiaolu
The kid sits here.

1408
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,120
Pangpang
Shouldn't the main seat propose a toast?

1409
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,720
Tutu
Come on, everyone.

1410
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,120
We're gathered here
Tutu

1411
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,440
Tutu
let's have a toast together.

1412
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,560
Terry
Cheers!

1413
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,200
Tutu
Let's laugh freely together.

1414
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,480
Tata
Let's be unrestrained together.

1415
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,600
Jiang Dunhao
Tutu really isn't the type to be a party pooper.

1416
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,120
Meina
He's good at warming up the atmosphere.

1417
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,520
Pangpang
Can we start now?

1418
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:40,960
Boss
Pangpang
Can we start now?

1419
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,560
Tutu
Yes.

1420
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,440
Let's eat, everyone, dig in!
Tutu

1421
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,560
Thank you.
Huahua.

1422
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,280
Pangpang.
Where's your bowl?

1423
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,280
Pangpang.
I'm sorry.

1424
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,760
Zhu Dan.
You're getting better at it.

1425
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,000
Thank you.
Huahua.

1426
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,160
Wu Zun.
You take one, I'll take one.

1427
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,640
Here.
Wu Zun.

1428
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,280
Terry.
You want the spicy one, right?

1429
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,680
Huahua.
Let me try it for you.

1430
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,800
Huahua.
It's not spicy.

1431
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,560
it's just garlic.
Huahua.

1432
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,080
Pangpang.
Her level of non-spiciness

1433
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,960
compared to your level of non-spiciness
Pangpang.

1434
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,200
Pangpang.
is not the same level of non-spiciness.

1435
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,320
Xinxin.
The other day when Terry stir-fried shredded potatoes,

1436
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,800
he only added a tiny bit of chili,
Xinxin.

1437
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,840
Xinxin.
he told me it was very spicy.

1438
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,800
Huahua.
He was sweating from the spiciness.

1439
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,160
Terry.
My sweat was dripping down.

1440
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,240
Terry.
That's so exaggerated.

1441
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,160
Pangpang.
I should be a bit better than you at eating spicy food.

1442
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,680
Pangpang.
Brother, you've lost.

1443
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,400
You're definitely better at eating spicy food than I am.
Terry.

1444
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,160
Chili sauce.
Tata.

1445
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,240
Or is it garlic chili sauce?
Tata.

1446
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,440
It's quite spicy, scoop less.
Harry.

1447
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,720
Tutu.
Mullet roe soup.

1448
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,080
This soup tastes pretty good.
Xiaoling.

1449
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
It's very savory.
Tutu.

1450
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,000
Isn't this your favorite?
Tangtang.

1451
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,360
Xiaoling.
Yes.

1452
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,320
Currently, right?
Tutu.

1453
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,440
Tangtang.
No, she's been

1454
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,720
Xiaoling.
liking it since she was little.

1455
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,080
Tutu.
She's liked this soup since she was little.

1456
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,400
Tangtang.
Wait a moment.

1457
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,040
Okay.
Tangtang.

1458
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,200
Tata.
You hold the chopsticks like this.

1459
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Susu.
This is how I hold chopsticks.

1460
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,080
Really?
Tata.

1461
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
Susu, why are you holding your chopsticks so low?
Huahua.

1462
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,960
Huahua
I heard that holding chopsticks close means you'll marry someone nearby.

1463
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
The further you hold your chopsticks, the further away you'll marry.
Huahua

1464
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,360
Pangpang
You're not planning to marry someone in Southeast Asia, are you?

1465
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,400
Here comes Goubuli, Goubuli.
Terry

1466
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,240
Goubuli is here.
Tutu

1467
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,320
Goubuli baozi.
Xiaoling

1468
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,440
This is delicious too.
Xiaoling

1469
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,120
Yes.
Tutu

1470
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,520
Dipping it in vinegar is really authentic.
Tutu

1471
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,080
Xinxin
Delicious.

1472
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,120
Huahua, I think it's delicious even though I don't usually eat baozi.

1473
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,680
Xinxin
Me too.

1474
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,080
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,

1475
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,840
good evening everyone.

1476
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,720
Good evening.
Tutu

1477
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,640
Huahua
Hello.

1478
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,080
Welcome everyone to Goubuli.

1479
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,280
Taste our traditional Tianjin cuisine,

1480
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,160
Goubuli baozi.

1481
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,680
Next, I'll perform a Tianjin kuaiban for you,

1482
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,240
'The Legend of Goubuli.'

1483
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,080
I hope you all enjoy it.

1484
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,040
Enjoy your meal,

1485
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,440
and may you always be smiling.

1486
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,640
Huahua
Great.

1487
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,040
As I clap these bamboo clappers,

1488
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,720
Together
I won't praise anything else.

1489
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,440
Zhu Dan
Let's praise

1490
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,200
Tianjin's

1491
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,160
Goubuli baozi.
Zhu Dan

1492
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,480
These Goubuli baozi,

1493
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,080
what makes them so special?

1494
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
They're good because of their fine craftsmanship,

1495
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,120
never using any fake ingredients.

1496
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,920
They have thin skin and big fillings,

1497
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,840
with eighteen pleats,

1498
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,080
just like a flower.

1499
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
Enjoy your meal.

1500
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,520
Thank you.
Huahua

1501
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,360
Tata
We've experienced Tianjin's local

1502
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,960
customs and culture.
Tata

1503
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,120
Tata
The whole atmosphere

1504
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,920
has become lively for us.
Tata

1505
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,640
Everyone is in a cheerful mood.
Tata

1506
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,320
Thank you.
Tutu

1507
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,240
Yang Gen
To the members of the small house,

1508
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,360
please share your photos.
Yang Gen

1509
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,040
Let Tutu go first, Tutu's in the main seat.
Pangpang

1510
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,800
Tutu
Then I'll start.

1511
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,040
The first one is
Tutu

1512
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
this one.
Tutu

1513
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,360
Huahua
So beautiful.

1514
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,040
Xinxin.
Blockbuster.

1515
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,720
Tutu.
That's right.

1516
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,640
Why did I put this photo
Tutu.

1517
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,320
Tutu.
as the first one?

1518
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
And then take a photo in this style?
Tutu.

1519
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,600
Tutu.
My first impression when entering the cabin

1520
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
was about Xiaoling,
Tutu.

1521
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,760
Tutu.
it might be a bit biased.

1522
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,120
She doesn't talk much,
Tutu.

1523
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,880
and she's a bit aloof.
Tutu.

1524
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
Tutu.
I've thought about it, I've conceived

1525
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,840
I said if she takes this type of photo,
Tutu.

1526
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,960
Tutu.
it would definitely have that feeling.

1527
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,120
So I
Tutu.

1528
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,080
Tutu.
took one for her.

1529
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,400
A high-scale black and white blockbuster.
Tutu.

1530
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,360
Tutu.
It perfectly matches the sea and waves.

1531
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,720
And her
Tutu.

1532
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,360
Tutu.
chiseled profile

1533
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,480
is so beautiful.
Tutu.

1534
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,040
Zhang Zining.
You're so good at complimenting.

1535
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,120
This is really beautiful.
Susu.

1536
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,680
Tutu.
Then for the second one, I thought it should also match

1537
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,280
our theme today, which is the ocean.
Tutu.

1538
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,720
This is also very beautiful.
Meina.

1539
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,960
Tutu.
It highlights the blue feeling.

1540
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,000
The state of flowing hair
Tutu.

1541
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,520
Tutu.
is very cool.

1542
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,960
Following the wind,
Tutu.

1543
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,720
being a person like the wind.
Tutu.

1544
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,480
Pangpang.
Like the wind.

1545
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,600
A woman like the wind.
Huahua.

1546
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,720
Zhang Zining.
My feelings are changing,

1547
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,480
but my protagonist isn't changing.
Zhang Zining.

1548
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,520
Tutu.
Not only beautiful and graceful,

1549
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,800
but also with a touch of prettiness.
Tutu.

1550
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,720
Zhu Dan.
The words of praise used casually

1551
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,800
are all very precise and sophisticated.
Zhu Dan.

1552
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,440
Tutu.
Next one.

1553
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,040
Thank you.
Xiaoling.

1554
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,440
Tutu.
The next one is my sibling.

1555
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,080
Little Deer.
Cute.

1556
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
Zhu Dan.
So cute.

1557
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,720
Tutu.
In my eyes, my sibling

1558
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,600
is a playful older sister.
Tutu.

1559
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,000
Tutu.
In my eyes, she's just like

1560
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,400
a mischievous little girl.
Tutu.

1561
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,760
and then I think,
Tutu

1562
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,320
Xiaoling
so beautiful.

1563
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,400
very good-looking.
Tutu

1564
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,720
Thank you, Xiaoling.
Huahua

1565
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
Tutu
These are my three photos.

1566
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,440
Thank you.
Tutu
These are my three photos.

1567
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,240
Pangpang
I'll review it.

1568
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,720
Pangpang
Qiaozui

1569
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,280
Qiaozui
Tairui

1570
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Huahua
It really is Qiaozui.

1571
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,400
Xiaoling
This is my first photo.

1572
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,920
Zhang Zining
so nice.

1573
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,320
Xiaoling
Tutu

1574
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,840
Xinxin
youthful vibe.

1575
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,400
very youthful vibe.
Xiaoling

1576
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,520
Susu
truly youthful vibe.

1577
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,520
You are 'Lin Yi'.
Susu

1578
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
Xiaoling
I remember my first day at the cabin,

1579
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,280
because I was the one who opened the door for him.
Xiaoling

1580
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,560
Xiaoling
And at the moment the door opened,

1581
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,120
I said he smiled so brightly.
Xiaoling

1582
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,480
Xiaoling
Hello.

1583
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,640
Tutu
Hello, everyone.

1584
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,400
Xiaoling
and so today,

1585
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,840
I actually took two photos of him,
Xiaoling

1586
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,560
Xiaoling
and he was smiling in all of them.

1587
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,600
I think this is,
Xiaoling

1588
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,440
Xiaoling
in my mind,

1589
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,680
the deepest impression of him.
Xiaoling

1590
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,520
Xiaoling
So this is,

1591
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,280
a very sunny Tutu,
Xiaoling

1592
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,040
Xiaoling
just basking in the sunlight.

1593
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,480
and I think I took it well,
Xiaoling

1594
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,920
and the model was also very, very good.
Xiaoling

1595
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,080
great cooperation.
Tutu

1596
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,520
Xiaoling
Yes, and this one is also Tutu,

1597
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,160
Meina
very sunny.

1598
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,320
smiling very happily.
Xiaoling

1599
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,120
Xiaoling, smile again.

1600
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,040
Tutu
it just doesn't have that feeling anymore.

1601
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,880
At the moment, I was very happy.
Tutu

1602
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Xiaoling
At the moment, just very happy.

1603
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,520
The camera captures the moment, right?
Xiaoling

1604
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,080
You said it very well.
Tutu

1605
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,280
This is Tom.
Xiaoling

1606
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,400
Huahua.
Tom.

1607
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,840
Susu.
Razor-sharp jawline.

1608
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,200
Xiaoling.
There's actually a reason for this.

1609
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Xiaoling.
It reminds me of Greek statues.

1610
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,000
So I chose this one.
Xiaoling.

1611
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,480
Xiaoling.
I think this one...

1612
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
My brother is quite handsome.
Xiaoling.

1613
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,640
Thank you.
Tangtang.

1614
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,200
Tangtang.
Okay.

1615
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,680
The first one is...
Tangtang.

1616
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,040
Tangtang.
I didn't expect Susu...

1617
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
to like this photo.
Tangtang.

1618
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,120
Huahua.
So cute.

1619
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,280
Tangtang.
It's a bit cuter.

1620
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,040
Just a bit playful.
Tangtang.

1621
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,280
Tangtang.
Like a red bean bun.

1622
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,320
Zhang Zining.
So sweet.

1623
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,800
Red bean bun.
Susu.

1624
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,080
Tangtang.
Like a happy little hamster.

1625
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,920
Tangtang.
Tangtang, I might not be very good at taking photos of girls.

1626
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,960
But Susu didn't blame me.
Tangtang.

1627
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,000
Instead, she kept helping me take photos.
Tangtang.

1628
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,200
Tangtang.
To capture such a happy moment.

1629
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,920
The second one is us walking along the coastline.
Tangtang.

1630
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,640
Tangtang.
walking towards the other side.

1631
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,000
Zhu Dan.
It's beautiful.

1632
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,960
Very gentle.
Zhu Dan.

1633
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,880
Jiang Dunhao.
Boyfriend's perspective.

1634
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,800
Tangtang.
We found some steps.

1635
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,560
We sat down.
Tangtang.

1636
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,080
Let's quietly appreciate the scenery.
Tangtang.

1637
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,520
Xiaoling.
Susu is appreciating the scenery.

1638
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,800
You're appreciating Susu, aren't you?
Xiaoling.

1639
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,160
Wu Zun.
That's a loving gaze.

1640
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,720
Right?
Wu Zun.

1641
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,480
Pangpang.
You're looking at the scenery, I'm looking at you.

1642
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,000
Tangtang.
Actually, I think this phrase might be more like...

1643
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,360
Like a rainbow, only seen when encountered.
Tangtang.

1644
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Then the last photo is of my sister.
Tangtang.

1645
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,080
Smiling so happily.
Terry.

1646
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,040
Huahua.
So beautiful.

1647
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,600
This is a bit like something created by Nüwa.
Tangtang.

1648
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,840
Tangtang.
I think she's a radiant sister.

1649
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,560
And she's always been my emotional support.
Tangtang.

1650
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,720
Tang Tang
Don't you know?

1651
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,560
Xiao Ling
I don't know.

1652
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,120
Tang Tang
Okay.

1653
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,240
Su Su
I'll talk about this one first.

1654
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,480
When it was taken,
Su Su

1655
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,720
Su Su
it looked particularly good on the phone.

1656
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,040
It's that kind of vitality.
Su Su

1657
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,840
Yang Gen, the sister-in-law took a shot.

1658
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,240
Yang Gen
Brother and sister-in-law.

1659
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,000
Su Su
The feeling of life.

1660
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,080
It's just the two of them talking.
Su Su

1661
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,640
Su Su
And I was just taking a candid shot.

1662
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,480
Su Su
Then they laughed really happily.

1663
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,600
I am like Tata's sibling.
Su Su

1664
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,120
Su Su
I took a very good picture of Tata.

1665
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,960
Thank you.
Tata

1666
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,240
This photo is
Su Su

1667
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,480
Tang Tang
so much like the captain.

1668
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,080
Su Su
I don't think it looks like the captain anywhere.

1669
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,360
Harry
Like a sailor.

1670
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,680
Tang Tang
You're the captain, I'm the sailor.

1671
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,240
Su Su
This picture looks great.

1672
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,000
This makes the nose look particularly high.
Su Su

1673
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,120
Hua Hua
Makes the nose look particularly high.

1674
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,360
His nose is naturally high.
Hua Hua

1675
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,080
Terry
Naturally high.

1676
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,920
And this one is
Su Su

1677
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,720
Su Su
that kind of Polaroid filter.

1678
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,480
Then just try it casually.
Su Su

1679
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,960
Su Su
I think this one looks pretty good.

1680
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,560
Su Su
Because it's not very posed.

1681
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,040
Tang Tang
Quick, compliment.

1682
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,480
Pang Pang
Really handsome.

1683
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,640
Terry
So handsome.

1684
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,520
Tang Tang
Really impressed.

1685
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,840
I still have to remind you.
Tang Tang

1686
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,280
Terry
No matter how you take it, it's handsome.

1687
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
Tang Tang
No, it's just well taken.

1688
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,200
Where is it?
Tang Tang

1689
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,680
Su Su

1690
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,280
Xin Xin
This jawline.

1691
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,040
This little Adam's apple.
Xin Xin

1692
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,040
Pang Pang
You two are both blade-like (jawline).

1693
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,920
Terry
'Blade siblings.'

1694
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,760
Zhang Zining
'Blade siblings.'

1695
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,280
Tata
You go first.

1696
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,360
Then I'll start.
Harry

1697
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,840
My sister isn't in these three photos.
Harry

1698
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,360
Pangpang
Pure love warrior

1699
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,280
Yang Gen
Our 'Love Siblings'

1700
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,320
has its own pure love god.
Yang Gen

1701
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,680
Harry
My sister is quite pretty.

1702
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,200
Her photos are also photos of us two.
Harry

1703
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,520
Harry
Actually, we didn't really...

1704
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,400
I mean, we didn't interact much.
Harry

1705
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,600
Harry
So I wanted to leave this peaceful moment

1706
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,200
for the two of them.
Harry

1707
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,560
Harry
I didn't disturb them.

1708
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,680
That's why they were able to take
Harry

1709
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,440
Harry
so many beautiful photos.

1710
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,520
It's also thanks to me not disturbing them.
Harry

1711
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,960
Harry
This photo is

1712
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,760
I just thought the colors were quite beautiful.
Harry

1713
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,320
The sky and sea are like a mirror.
Harry

1714
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,720
This has a model-like feel.
Wu Zun

1715
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,200
Zhu Dan
Yes.

1716
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,920
Tata looks good in every shot.
Zhu Dan

1717
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,240
And she has presence.
Zhu Dan

1718
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,320
It's really beautiful.
Xiaoling

1719
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,720
Isn't this because the model is beautiful?
Huahua

1720
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,920
Terry
I think so too.

1721
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,880
Harry
Let me tell you.

1722
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,720
I took over 200 photos.
Harry

1723
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,320
She was unsatisfied with 200 of them.
Harry

1724
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,400
Tata
What do you mean 200 unsatisfactory photos?

1725
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,280
I didn't even have time to finish selecting, okay?
Tata

1726
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,400
Tata
You're slandering me.

1727
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,480
Then this photo is
Harry

1728
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,680
Huahua
So beautiful.

1729
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,240
Harry
Zoom in the camera.

1730
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,560
I think it looks better than shooting from far away.
Harry

1731
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,840
Harry
The person is still the main subject.

1732
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,480
The scenery is secondary.
Harry

1733
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,280
This photo hasn't been edited.
Susu

1734
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,000
No editing.
Harry

1735
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,000
I took it really well.
Harry

1736
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,680
Okay, I'll praise you.
Tata

1737
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,840
Really.
Tata.

1738
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,240
Harry.
There's one more photo of us together.

1739
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,440
It's the first time I feel we've taken a photo together by the sea.
Harry.

1740
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,800
So I decided to share it.
Harry.

1741
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,600
Terry.
It's meaningful.

1742
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,800
Harry.
Yes, it's meaningful.

1743
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,000
Milestone.
Harry.

1744
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,920
Pangpang.
You've said all the words I wanted to say, buddy.

1745
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,520
Terry.
It's okay, you can say it again.

1746
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,560
Too late.
Pangpang.

1747
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,040
Tata.
All the photos I took are of Harry too.

1748
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,960
The first one is
Tata.

1749
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,040
Tata.
a photo of Harry crouching by the sea.

1750
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,160
This one looks good.
Huahua.

1751
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,280
Tata.
And there are many seagulls in the background.

1752
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,840
This photo has quite an atmosphere.
Tata.

1753
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,360
Meina.
It looks nice.

1754
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,160
Yang Gen.
This one is so handsome.

1755
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,960
There are so many seagulls here.
Meina.

1756
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,000
Tata.
The second one is still Harry.

1757
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,240
But it's a photo of his back.
Tata.

1758
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,480
Tata.
It was taken when he was feeding the seagulls.

1759
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,840
He's been feeding them all day today.
Tata.

1760
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,560
It looks good.
Tata.

1761
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,080
Tata.
And this one is still

1762
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,720
I've included a photo of us together.
Tata.

1763
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,440
Terry.
Isn't it the same one?

1764
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,360
Huahua.
Is it different?

1765
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,520
Tata.
It's different from the previous one.

1766
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,600
It's just that my expression is different.
Tata.

1767
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,480
Terry.

1768
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,480
Tata.

1769
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,920
Huahua.
His expression is the same.

1770
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
Harry.
No, my expression is different too.

1771
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,960
My eyes look bigger in this photo.
Harry.

1772
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,400
Huahua.
Let me go first.

1773
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,480
Terry.
Okay, you go first.

1774
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,960
Huahua.
All three photos I took are of Terry.

1775
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,360
Because I took 200 photos,
Huahua.

1776
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,880
Huahua.
he might appear in 199 of them.

1777
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,280
Huahua, so I basically gave him close-ups in most of them.
Huahua.

1778
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,000
Huahua.
Like this one.

1779
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,400
Meina.
It looks good.

1780
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,480
Huahua.
Look at his melancholic feeling.

1781
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
The heartthrob and the sea.
Tangtang.

1782
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,720
Huahua.
Everyone can take a look.

1783
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,280
Huahua.
and the second one has a lot of seagulls.

1784
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,280
because we've been attracting them.
Huahua.

1785
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,280
Huahua.
I want a lot of seagulls to come over.

1786
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,720
and take pictures with us.
Huahua.

1787
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,840
Huahua.
okay, we ended up waiting for a flock of seagulls.

1788
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,440
Huahua.
this one is also me, just

1789
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,880
mostly capturing his close-up.
Huahua.

1790
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,200
Huahua.
I think Terry is perfect for close-ups.

1791
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,800
this one looks great.
Zhang Zining.

1792
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,120
Huahua.
look at the blade-like jawline.

1793
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,360
I captured it too.
Huahua.

1794
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,520
Xiaoling.
join our 'Blade Siblings'.

1795
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,480
Terry.
'Blade Family', I'm joining you.

1796
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,320
Pangpang.
come on, Blade.

1797
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,000
Pangpang.
look at you three.

1798
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,320
Huahua.
aren't they all good-looking?

1799
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,600
yes.
Tutu.

1800
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,360
Huahua.
I think Terry is so photogenic.

1801
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,200
Wu Zun.
gone, Pangpang is gone.

1802
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,280
no chance anymore.
Wu Zun.

1803
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,880
is this the same as the first one?
Tata.

1804
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,640
Huahua.
there's a left face and a right face, okay?

1805
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,440
every angle is showcased.
Huahua.

1806
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,440
Tata.

1807
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
Huahua.
it proves that Brother Bo

1808
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,640
he doesn't just have one good side.
Huahua.

1809
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,440
Terry.
then it's my turn.

1810
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,600
like the first one.
Terry.

1811
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,760
Terry.
it's just Huahua might be feeding the seagulls.

1812
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,920
Xinxin.
so beautiful.

1813
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,480
Terry.
this photo is full of atmosphere.

1814
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,360
everyone take a look.
Terry.

1815
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,280
Terry.
then,

1816
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,960
I know you all want this seagull.
Terry.

1817
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,840
Huahua.
really obedient.

1818
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,000
this is amazing, the atmosphere.
Terry.

1819
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,240
Terry.
the last one is also my favorite.

1820
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,760
Meina.
Sweet Girl.

1821
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,880
this looks good.
Susu.

1822
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,720
Terry.
it's super sweet and super beautiful.

1823
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,640
just last time in the ancient city.
Terry.

1824
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,280
Terry.
when I took pictures of her.

1825
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,000
I already found Huahua's photos very cute.
Terry.

1826
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,720
Huahua.
yes.

1827
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,000
fun.
Harry.

1828
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,440
These two big seagulls.
Harry.

1829
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,800
Terry.
They're so obedient, our seagulls.

1830
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,680
Huahua.
They're really obedient.

1831
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,000
Tata.
Your seagulls.

1832
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,000
Pangpang.
They know them.

1833
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,120
Tutu.
They raised them.

1834
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,520
Pangpang.
They called them over.

1835
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,200
Pangpang.
Let me do it.

1836
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,880
Pangpang.
Let's take a look at this photo.

1837
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,440
Huahua.
It's beautiful.

1838
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,600
Pangpang.
There's no special technique.

1839
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,400
My sister is purely beautiful.
Pangpang.

1840
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,160
Huahua.
It's all about emotion.

1841
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,960
Pangpang.
My sister is strikingly beautiful.

1842
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,160
Pangpang.
When I was taking photos of her,

1843
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,720
it was about capturing that moment.
Pangpang.

1844
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,840
Pangpang.
Pangpang, I realized that every movement of my sister

1845
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,320
every expression is beautiful.
Pangpang.

1846
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,160
Pangpang.
My sister is purely beautiful.

1847
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,120
Huahua.
Absolutely gorgeous.

1848
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,640
Pangpang.
The second one is the same.

1849
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,000
My sister's different expressions
Pangpang.

1850
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,920
Susu.
are beautiful.

1851
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Huahua.
So beautiful.

1852
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,360
Pangpang.
Although she wanted to attract the seagulls,

1853
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
she couldn't.
Pangpang.

1854
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Couldn't attract them.
Xinxin.

1855
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,280
Pangpang.
Indeed, I don't know them.

1856
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,720
Pangpang.
Indeed.

1857
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,080
Terry.
You should have asked for our help.

1858
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,320
Pangpang.
Indeed, I don't know them.

1859
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,200
I was focused on taking photos for Xinxin.
Pangpang.

1860
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,240
Pangpang.
The next one is of me and Huahua.

1861
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,440
Jiang Dunhao.
Taken with love.

1862
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,360
Pangpang.
Huahua and I didn't take any photos along the way.

1863
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,680
Because the two of them were taking photos.
Pangpang.

1864
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,640
Pangpang.
Then when we were leaving, I said,

1865
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,880
'Let's take one anyway.'
Pangpang.

1866
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,160
Pangpang.
When we took it, time was tight.

1867
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
The sun was right in front of us.
Pangpang.

1868
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,880
Pangpang.
The phone just happened to shade my face a bit.

1869
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,840
But this one,
Pangpang.

1870
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,200
Pangpang.
I think it's okay.

1871
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,800
It represents my unknown love.
Pangpang.

1872
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,920
Xinxin.
Unknown love.
