1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like we'll have some wild wine.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a surprise benefit.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Weibo. Take part in #Love siblings and friends observation room #Interaction You might be the next one to be flipped.

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
So you and Harry are like this.

10
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,440
Like this. Like this.

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
Maybe.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,840
Do you think he'll give it to me today?

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I think he will.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,440
If he didn't give it to me,

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,400
I would cry.

16
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,720
I'll be the first one

17
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,120
It's so serious.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,880
What should I do?

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
I'll give it to him even if he won't give it to me.

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
I feel sorry for her again.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,759
I'm so contradictory.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,880
So who will you text today?

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Tonight?

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,680
I have to tell you that too.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,600
Who will you send it to?

26
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,640
She asked him

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,600
She asked directly.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,640
They both asked.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
They didn't tell me.

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,640
Or do you want to hesitate?

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,720
I'll tell you.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,199
Who will you send it to?

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,199
I won't tell you.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,080
If you don't tell me,

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll tell you if you tell me.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
Just tell me.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,680
I won't tell you.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,680
Can I ask you

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
who you sent to the other day?

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,640
He started to trace ahead.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,560
I think Tata likes to make things difficult for him.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
Seeing him in a difficult situation,

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,240
She thinks it's cute.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Yes.

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I sent it to Xinxin on the first day.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,800
and sent it to Xiaoling the next day.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,840
I went on a date with her.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
and said it clearly.

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,240
I said thank you.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,160
You didn't make me embarrassed.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,800
My friend

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,240
is very honest.

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
He purposely emphasized my friend.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Yes.

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,200
But you made me feel awkward today.

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
When I gave you the invitation card,

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
you asked me why I gave it to you.

59
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,040
Why do you want it?

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
I didn't.

61
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,680
You did.

62
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Why did you tell me when I gave it to you?

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
Really?

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,160
Yes.

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
Because you've invited someone else,

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
you probably didn't expect me to invite you.

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,520
Why are you giving it to me?

68
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,120
I invited you.

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
I was so surprised that you wanted to

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Why?

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,520
Because of me.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Because of you.

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
I can understand your text.

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
Actually,

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Choose one of the three that's not awkward.

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,160
But

77
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
gave me

78
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,760
who was excluded.

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
I had no choice.

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,640
Harry is also trying to prove to Tata.

81
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
What's wrong?

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,079
Right?

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Speaking of which, right?

84
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,360
No.

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Suddenly.

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
I thought it was thundering.

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,600
A "wo" sound.

88
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,840
No.

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,840
No?

90
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,600
I told you. You're funny, right?

91
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,800
Good words, bad words.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Good words.

93
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Isn't that good?

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,960
Great.

95
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
You said I was dull and I said you were funny.

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
You listen to me.

97
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
If you say so, I'll...

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
with high EQ.

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
We can complement each other.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
Right?

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,720
You don't even say that.

102
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
He didn't say anything.

103
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
What's wrong?

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,320
You're so dull.

105
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,200
Just wait.

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Then what are you?

107
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm Big Bull.

108
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,160
Think about it.

109
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
You don't have to talk.

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm not embarrassed now.

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
Aren't you embarrassed now?

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,440
You are.

113
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,680
No.

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
Then why do you keep

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
want to talk?

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Then I'll stop.

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,120
Then I'll stop.

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,640
Say it.

119
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,240
It's all about flirting.

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Yes.

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
Does this date have such a big impact?

122
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,200
Dating culture is indeed

123
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes, we still have a date.

124
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Just give each other a chance.

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,080
And it looks like a joke.

126
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,800
I gave you all the answers.

127
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,640
Excellent.

128
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,200
Master.

129
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
Amazing, master.

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
And I think both of them are sincere enough.

131
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,640
They're not trying to fool each other.

132
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
They're all serious.

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,880
Even if this question is a joke,

134
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,440
or something like that.

135
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,680
Yes.

136
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
But my answer is sincere.

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Yes.

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
This is very important.

139
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,200
He's good at grabbing it.

140
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,200
So cold.

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,840
Coming

142
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,280
Look at the soup.

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,040
So quiet.

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
Who is this

145
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Looking at men or women

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
Good evening.

147
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
Good evening.

148
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
She's looking forward to Harry coming back.

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
Why are there only four of you?

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
Do you want to join us?

151
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Get changed first.

152
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,640
Go.

153
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
He heard the sound.

154
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,880
Will she go find the soup?

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Don't go down.

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
Yes, take the initiative.

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,280
He heard the sound.

158
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,240
He's going down.

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Good evening.

160
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
Do you want taco?

161
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,160
What?

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,640
Taco.

163
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,240
I'm not eating.

164
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Eat later.

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You guys eat first.

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,360
I just woke up.

167
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh no.

168
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,040
It's too hot.

169
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,280
It's too hot.

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Here.

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,640
Don't cover your awkwardness with singing.

172
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,440
He doesn't dare to take this step.

173
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,800
Soup.

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,680
I got scalded.

175
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
The microwave is a bit strong.

176
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Why is my first reaction dodging?

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
I was afraid I might splash on you.

178
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
A man should protect himself.

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,840
I want to help her with the soup.

180
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
This is just right.

181
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh no, but he's going to be exhausted.

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
What happened?

183
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,680
Nothing.

184
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,920
I was sitting at the restaurant.

185
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,040
She didn't look at me.

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,520
We wiped it face to face.

187
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
She just walked over.

188
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
A sensitive person is in a close relationship.

189
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
It's really hard.

190
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
I feel sorry for our soup.

191
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,280
I don't know how to communicate.

192
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,120
and what choice she would make.

193
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
Should I wait for you?

194
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,840
Why are you...

195
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Why are you still bringing this up?

196
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,360
Don't you want to eat?

197
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
No, I do.

198
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Let's eat.

199
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,760
Warm it up.

200
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,240
We need to save food, you know?

201
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,840
Let's go.

202
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,520
Let's go.

203
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
Why are you dressed up?

204
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
You have food too. Oh no. I ate too early.

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,720
It's all delicious.

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
They haven't even touched

207
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,880
Right?

208
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,160
So many delicious food.

209
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,000
What's wrong?

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,040
Nothing.

211
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm not.

212
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
You have something?

213
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
I have something important to do.

214
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,040
Let's sit there.

215
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
Changed seats.

216
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,760
That's too much attention.

217
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,760
Smile.

218
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,440
Not my buddy.

219
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,000
What are you laughing at?

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,800
Have fun.

221
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,520
Smile on the face but in the heart

222
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
What?

223
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,960
What's in your heart?

224
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Nothing.

225
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,760
They're going to talk about this.

226
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,040
What? Is it fun?

227
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
I think we had a good chat.

228
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
Xinxin is not happy.

229
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,640
No.

230
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
I...

231
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,560
How should I put it?

232
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
But I'm curious about your choice later.

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,080
Okay, you got me.

234
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
You're a little hesitant.

235
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,040
Very conflicted and contradictory.

236
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,880
Does he like you?

237
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't know.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
But I think we had a good chat.

239
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
First, her Cupid invitation card.

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Give me my brother.

241
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,760
I asked her, she said she wanted to choose me.

242
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
and texted me the second day.

243
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
The third day he sent me this morning.

244
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
That one.

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
She gave me the invitation card for the sports day.

246
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,040
I chose Xinxin.

247
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,600
But I think she can do it.

248
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
I think maybe

249
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
you hesitated.

250
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
How dare you laugh at me?

251
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,040
I brought the Book of Answer.

252
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,600
You know?

253
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
For now.

254
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Okay.

255
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
Hurry up. It'll be too late.

256
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
You drive.

257
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,400
Just open it?

258
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
Open it yourself.

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,040
Wait.

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
So I want you

261
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
not to change your choice.

262
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
If you don't want me to change, then...

263
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
He doesn't want Susu to change.

264
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,680
So,

265
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,040
you've thought about it before you turned it over.

266
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,840
Definitely.

267
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
It's over.

268
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
Who knows?

269
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,400
when he hesitated,

270
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,440
when he hesitates.

271
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Yes.

272
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,280
He wants to change.

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Go ahead.

274
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,680
See? I said I have the answer.

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,280
To whom?

276
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,280
Come on.

277
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,800
Go, boy.

278
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Go for the soup!

279
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,440
Who?

280
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,840
Who else?

281
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
Coming.

282
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,240
Here comes the chance.

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,760
Susu.

284
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Which one?

285
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,080
Yes.

286
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,800
What did you say?

287
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,560
Seriously.

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,360
This is quite fun.

289
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,000
Not bad, right?

290
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,680
When I was reading the Book of Answer,

291
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,280
I firmly decided

292
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
and do my best.

293
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
He's afraid to talk to her.

294
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,200
Who do you think I want to send messages to?

295
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
You can choose whoever you want.

296
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,840
What do you think?

297
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
I can't give you an answer.

298
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
Harry wants the soup

299
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
to prove his answer.

300
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Yes.

301
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,800
What?

302
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Nothing.

303
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,400
What are you doing?

304
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,280
Everyone is so nervous.

305
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,320
This atmosphere

306
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
This is so nerve-racking.

307
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,040
Who sent it to?

308
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
I'm a little hesitant.

309
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,800
I can't choose.

310
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
In fact, I'm very torn.

311
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,680
I never thought about the result.

312
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,640
I don't know.

313
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,480
This choice

314
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,760
I will be harder than before.

315
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,560
It's hard.

316
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,440
Harry went on a date.

317
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,320
I don't know how his date was.

318
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm going to text him soon.

319
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,800
It'll be hard.

320
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,520
This message is very important.

321
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,400
Because Esther will prove her answer.

322
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes, if Xinxin didn't receive it today,

323
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,880
she would cry.

324
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,560
Yes.

325
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,600
So nervous.

326
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,040
My hands are sweating.

327
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
It's important to soup too.

328
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
If Susu gives it to him,

329
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,680
he'll feel much better.

330
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,040
Yes.

331
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,120
But if Tae-seo gives him a date,

332
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,240
the soup will be too sad.

333
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
Yes.

334
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,400
In each episode,

335
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
based on

336
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,040
We can form groups freely.

337
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,480
Each team will deduct

338
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,240
and give the answer.

339
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,520
The team who guesses the most right

340
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,680
will get one

341
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Guoli Wild Crest.

342
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
In the last episode,

343
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
the most wild badges of Guoli

344
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,520
will receive a mysterious award

345
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,320
by Yuwo Liqiang.

346
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
This episode's deduction is

347
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,680
Please guess

348
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
the direction of today's message.

349
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
Next, we are going to

350
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,240
of "Love Sisters".

351
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,560
Now we can divide into groups.

352
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Let's divide into two teams first.

353
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,000
Should we divide it by sofa?

354
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
Team 1.

355
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
Team 1.

356
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
Okay.

357
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
The four of us. The four of you.

358
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,680
I don't think there are two-sided ones this time, right?

359
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
It's really broken.

360
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm sure Hua will give it to Chubby.

361
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,880
But Hwa played sports with Tae-seo.

362
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,840
She's good too.

363
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,120
Tata is more clear.

364
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,320
Tata is Harry.

365
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
The map will be given to Tata.

366
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,720
He clearly said

367
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,640
Tata makes his heart flutter.

368
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,760
Is Xiaoling fat too?

369
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
Xiaoling should be fat. Yeah.

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,840
I think Susu will send

371
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,200
the date today.

372
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,520
Right?

373
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,520
But is it possible that

374
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,920
after one day of contact with Xiaoling, he...

375
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,440
Will you make Hua misunderstand?

376
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,160
If I were Hua, I would be unhappy.

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
They seem to have the same problem.

378
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,080
I went on a date with you today.

379
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
I texted you politely

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,800
I'll text you politely.

381
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm struggling.

382
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
We're connected.

383
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
It's not easy.

384
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
Three, two, one, go.

385
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,320
OK, their (answer)

386
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,800
I can't even see clearly.

387
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,880
We choose Susu Soup.

388
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
And Tarri gives it to Susu.

389
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,800
So do we.

390
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,040
Flowers for Tae-seo.

391
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,760
No.

392
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,480
For whom?

393
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,560
Flowers for Terri.

394
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,760
We give them to Fatty.

395
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,320
Did Hua give Fatty

396
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
or Tae-ri?

397
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,640
Okay, next,

398
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Let's enter

399
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,960
a party with wild wine.

400
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,040
It's time to reveal the truth.

401
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,920
My heart is beating so fast now.

402
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,600
If I didn't sleep less,

403
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
my heart would be beating fast now.

404
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,120
My heart is calm now.

405
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,640
Next time, we must win.

406
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,040
Fatty.

407
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
Next time we'll get the first place.

408
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,080
I guess Fatty sent it to me.

409
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Because we got the last place today.

410
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,040
I think we'll have another chance.

411
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
Yes, I can't hide it.

412
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,760
I sent it to Xiao Ling.

413
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,520
I've sent it. We'll get the first place next time.

414
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,960
First, I said next time.

415
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,520
I just want to get along with you.

416
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
It's okay if you get three points today.

417
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
I had fun.

418
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,440
I received a reply from Xiaoling.

419
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm quite happy.

420
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
She sent me

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
Although she got three points today,

422
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,400
she was happy.

423
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
So I mean

424
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,440
today, it means I feel happy

425
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
makes her happy.

426
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
I texted Fatty today.

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,960
I just want to express

428
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,599
my emotions.

429
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,880
I had fun.

430
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
He's looking forward to it.

431
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
He's looking forward to it.

432
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,400
Really?

433
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,319
Why isn't mine here yet?

434
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
None of them.

435
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,240
Did you have a good date today?

436
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Xin.

437
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
There was a smoke bomb in the text.

438
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,840
Did she say she had a good date today?

439
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,600
I think it's Xinxin.

440
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,040
It must be Xinxin.

441
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,120
I still sent it to Harry.

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,920
I asked him if he had a good date today.

443
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,040
That's what I wanted to ask

444
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,000
at that time.

445
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,880
I think this sentence

446
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
has my own style.

447
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,800
He will know it's me.

448
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,920
She's so brave.

449
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,000
I think today's message

450
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,560
was sent by Xin.

451
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
I think Esther and Tata

452
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,320
are the girls

453
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,080
who can send messages to me.

454
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,960
Esther's personality is to play with me.

455
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
and play with me.

456
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
A girl

457
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
Tata belongs to

458
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,560
who can chat with.

459
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,160
Harry was in the car tonight.

460
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,520
He's trying to find out

461
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,640
who I'm sending to tonight,

462
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I actually felt that

463
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,320
He might be hinting at me.

464
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,040
I think the most romantic thing

465
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,880
the most romantic thing is preference.

466
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
So I'm looking forward to it.

467
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,120
I think Harry sent it.

468
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,040
Maybe he chatted with me in the car.

469
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,080
in the car.

470
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
He probably wanted to know more about me.

471
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,040
I must be happy then.

472
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,160
Because he still thought about me after the date.

473
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,200
But I think

474
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
a little perfunctory.

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
No, what are you looking at now?

476
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,400
Just look at the tower

477
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,280
So happy.

478
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,280
No.

479
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
No way.

480
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,320
Someone else?

481
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
I think it's someone else.

482
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,760
who is full of bad ideas.

483
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,480
It can only be from Harry.

484
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm pretty sure

485
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,280
who sent it to me.

486
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Harry.

487
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,280
Who sent her this?

488
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,520
Xinxin is the one who sent the picture.

489
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,320
Right?

490
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,880
Map.

491
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
The scariest thing is Xin thought

492
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
Harry sent her a message.

493
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
She's still laughing.

494
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,080
She's full of bad ideas.

495
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
This is too obvious, right?

496
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
The content of our chat tonight

497
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
This is him.

498
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,360
Aren't you bored?

499
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,080
You don't belong

500
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,240
a boring one.

501
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,720
What's wrong?

502
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,000
You're so dull.

503
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,840
Right?

504
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
He seems bolder than yesterday.

505
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
He dares to make fun of me.

506
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,720
He said I was a dummy.

507
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,640
But I think if it were yesterday,

508
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,320
he wouldn't dare to say that.

509
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,600
He just showed his feelings.

510
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,720
about my feelings.

511
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,960
I didn't mean to hint her.

512
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,520
It's obvious that I sent it.

513
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Tata's face

514
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
to my taste.

515
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
How can you do it so openly?

516
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
Oh no. Where is Xinxin?

517
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
She sent the message to Xinxin.

518
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,880
The girls in the small house are excellent.

519
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
Actually, I want to get in touch with them.

520
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,560
Really.

521
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,600
God, this is really...

522
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,680
I received Hua's message.

523
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,320
It was obviously her.

524
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,240
We had fun this afternoon.

525
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,560
I texted Tae-seo

526
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,800
I sent it to Tae-seo.

527
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,560
I think Tae-seo is very careful.

528
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,000
I didn't always skate on the snow.

529
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
When Tae-ri saw it,

530
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
he will help me.

531
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,760
Here.

532
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,400
Thank you.

533
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't slip.

534
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,760
Okay.

535
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,160
I think he's quite considerate.

536
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
After spending the whole day with him,

537
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
I think I get along quite well with him.

538
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I can get to know more about him.

539
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm very happy today.

540
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
I think this one

541
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,760
was sent by the map.

542
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
The map was sent to the tower.

543
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,720
The map?

544
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,160
Yes.

545
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,720
The message I sent today was Tata.

546
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Because I want to know more about

547
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,200
other than

548
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
we have

549
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
in life.

550
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,920
and praise me for being a cheerful boy.

551
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,360
I guess it's Tata.

552
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,320
He guessed it was Tata.

553
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,280
Tata has sent it to Harry.

554
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,560
There are two people misunderstanding on this table.

555
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,720
I sent my message to Map tonight.

556
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,480
What?

557
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,640
She didn't send it to Harry.

558
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,240
When we rushed down from the slope,

559
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
from the slope,

560
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,680
the map was standing on the slope

561
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,240
standing on that slope.

562
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Trust me, Tata.

563
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Come on.

564
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,880
Next.

565
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,040
During the sports day,

566
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,840
he was always full of energy.

567
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,040
He's always full of energy.

568
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,680
Actually, I really need

569
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,360
such a friend.

570
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,600
or a friend

571
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,280
Harry.

572
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,920
My Harry can't get hurt like this.

573
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,160
Harry won't get hurt.

574
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,560
It's Xinxin who got hurt.

575
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
You worry about Xinxin first.

576
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,240
Are you talking about Harry?

577
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
What happened to Harry?

578
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,480
Does she think

579
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,760
she and Harry have confirmed it.

580
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,880
Then she sent this to Tu.

581
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,800
to comfort her.

582
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
I think because he's a master,

583
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,840
A master?

584
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,960
I'm sure you'll send it to me.

585
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
I won't send it to you today.

586
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,760
You think Tata is a master?

587
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,560
She must be a master.

588
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,000
Tata must be a master.

589
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,880
Now it seems

590
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,760
If you post like this, Tata is a master.

591
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,480
She's totally good at Harry.

592
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,800
Harry is a master.

593
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,080
But he met a master.

594
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,720
Did they just fight?

595
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,600
Do you think...

596
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
I never thought of that possibility.

597
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,400
Who is it?

598
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,880
Thank you for your hard work.

599
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,040
Actually, when I received your message,

600
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,160
I didn't know whose text it was.

601
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
But I have a guess.

602
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,440
it should be soup.

603
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,160
I don't really understand

604
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,400
the meaning of this letter.

605
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
But I can feel

606
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
the enthusiasm of this letter

607
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
is not very high.

608
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
It's very plain.

609
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,080
It doesn't look like it.

610
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,960
The soup is usually sent to me.

611
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,040
That kind of text.

612
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,680
This look.

613
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,640
I'll send it to her today.

614
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,480
I firmly chose

615
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Susu.

616
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,960
Being with her

617
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,800
I think I have a lot of happy time.

618
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
It's not the Book of answers at all.

619
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,760
I have the answer in my heart.

620
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,120
Yes.

621
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,000
to prove my answer.

622
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,320
The Book of Answer is the clown.

623
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,560
I'm curious if she'll send it to me.

624
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,840
I'm sorry I rejected you this afternoon.

625
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,040
I wish you

626
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,480
Susu.

627
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,960
Susu gave it to Tairui.

628
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,560
Send this message to Terri.

629
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,480
Because it was his birthday that day.

630
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,840
he was refunded like this.

631
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
I think

632
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,240
I should apologize

633
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,560
and something I want to say.

634
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
When we were eating,

635
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,160
we had a good chat.

636
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,600
I found that we are very similar.

637
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,160
When I saw Susu's message,

638
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,320
I thought I still had a chance.

639
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,080
Oh no.

640
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,360
I didn't get a text.

641
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,200
I was quite disappointed.

642
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,680
I was

643
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,520
unhappy.

644
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,240
If we like each other,

645
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,760
this kind of situation doesn't exist.

646
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,640
You should care about each other's feelings

647
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
than your own feelings.

648
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,920
The soup is not like this.

649
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,560
He will put everything together

650
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
into an answer.

651
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,920
When she came in and ignored him,

652
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,440
Ignore him and stay away from him.

653
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,600
I haven't texted him yet.

654
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,440
Oh no.

655
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,200
He just combined

656
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,520
a story line of his own internal consumption.

657
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
And soup is demanding

658
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
for himself.

659
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,280
Yes, that's right.

660
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,080
Like this, he'll try to say

661
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,800
what I didn't do well.

662
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,720
Right.

663
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,160
But I think

664
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
he will move forward bravely.

665
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,880
Yeah.

666
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
But I feel sorry for him.

667
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,080
a big-hearted person.

668
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,800
He'll move forward soon.

669
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,440
It's okay.

670
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
It's a kind of exercise.

671
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,720
It's okay.

672
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,840
College students are at a good age to be sad.

673
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
It's time to grow up.

674
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,880
I can totally feel

675
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,640
he's developing towards Xiao Ling.

676
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Poor Hua.

677
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
I still feel a little disappointed.

678
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,880
That's the awkward part.

679
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,800
He said

680
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,760
I hope he can accept other girls.

681
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,480
But there's still hope in his heart.

682
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,960
If he doesn't want it,

683
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,240
he will firmly choose me.

684
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,960
No matter what,

685
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
he's willing to follow me.

686
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,200
He doesn't dare to express himself bravely.

687
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,280
We got the message.

688
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,040
Don't laugh.

689
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,480
I think she must have received

690
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,880
received Harry's message today.

691
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
If she didn't receive Harry's message,

692
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,920
she would've jumped up and snatched the house.

693
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,720
It's messy.

694
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,600
It's all messed up.

695
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,760
Don't be angry.

696
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
Actually, I really feel cold sweat for her.

697
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
Because I think

698
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,920
I wouldn't have

699
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,520
for two days.

700
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
I think

701
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
some minor problems.

702
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,200
She may not

703
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,760
not as active as others.

704
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,680
She hid herself

705
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,360
hide or protect herself well.

706
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
Don't always help others.

707
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
and try to get in touch with them.

708
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,680
My men didn't receive any text today.

709
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
When I found out about this,

710
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,160
my first reaction

711
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,600
I glanced at him subconsciously.

712
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,240
I was afraid that he was looking at me.

713
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,080
because I didn't want him to find out.

714
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,320
I was observing him.

715
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
Then I took it back immediately.

716
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,040
But after a while, I couldn't help

717
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,120
I kept looking at him.

718
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,040
His expression is

719
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,160
I think he laughed helplessly.

720
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,960
I can feel that

721
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,640
tired and uncomfortable.

722
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,160
So I think

723
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,680
it must be related to the text.

724
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,720
Both of them

725
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
care about each other's emotions.

726
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
and sensitive.

727
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,560
Terri received two

728
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,640
I think one is Susu.

729
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,120
and Huahua.

730
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,760
Because he actually

731
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,160
with Hana.

732
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,160
The new two are so popular.

733
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,400
The map and Harry are obvious.

734
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,800
It's them.

735
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,240
I want to know

736
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,440
who the map and Harry prefer.

737
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,240
Tata.

738
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,240
Tata, I miss you.

739
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,640
I miss you.

740
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,360
He's so brave.

741
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,280
The launch of love.

742
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,640
The map thinks he and Tata have chosen each other.

743
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
Respond.

744
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,080
I want to say something to everyone.

745
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,640
Harry is falling.

746
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
This show is so good.

747
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
This show is awesome.

748
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,560
But nothing bad happened.

749
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,880
Actually, I think everyone has a good heart.

750
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,560
Yeah.

751
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,880
Everyone is here.

752
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,480
Yes, but...

753
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,680
caused these misunderstandings.

754
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,800
A kind misunderstanding.

755
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,400
I miss you.

756
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,840
I miss you.

757
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,800
Show us the answer of the two teams.

758
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,920
We have one more.

759
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
One more than us.

760
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,680
Yes.

761
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,800
Hua seems to be...

762
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,840
Yes, Hua got it wrong.

763
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,480
Congratulations on our victory.

764
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
Every winning team

765
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,240
will get

766
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,720
Guoli Wildlife Crest.

767
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,800
Harry is lost.

768
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,720
Harry applied for a sibling house.

769
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,480
Yes.

770
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,720
I think my brothers

771
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,080
because he knows me better.

772
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,200
through me.

773
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,520
I can tell

774
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,760
I could tell that I was struggling.

775
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,880
Then he snatched the house of siblings.

776
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,880
Both of them have a lot

777
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
to talk to each other.

778
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,520
They both have something on their mind.

779
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,120
I want to laugh

780
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
I want to laugh.

781
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,800
Because I saw your face.

782
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,520
You know what?

783
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
I didn't ask many questions.

784
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,840
I know.

785
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,760
But you didn't choose the soup.

786
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,960
I just didn't send it to him.

787
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,880
You didn't send it to him?

788
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes.

789
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,160
You sent it to...

790
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,040
I knew it.

791
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
He didn't send it to you.

792
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
He didn't.

793
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,400
Actually, I'm fine.

794
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I sent it to him because I think

795
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
he seems to care.

796
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,320
I rejected him today.

797
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,160
When we were eating and chatting,

798
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
he said it several times.

799
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,600
Anyway...

800
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,240
And...

801
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,720
I want to send it to him

802
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,280
I think I should send it to him.

803
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Actually, I thought about

804
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,120
after I sent this message,

805
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,800
should I explain to Soup?

806
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
Are you going to explain?

807
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,480
Is this the reason for your birthday?

808
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,560
But it's really like this.

809
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,320
To be honest,

810
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,520
Explain is just a cover-up.

811
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,240
After explaining,

812
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,440
the soup can sleep well.

813
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,960
If she likes him, she has to explain.

814
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,720
Who did you send it to?

815
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Who?

816
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,800
The one next to you.

817
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,880
Tata.

818
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,760
I had a great chat today.

819
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Okay.

820
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,000
Who sent it to you today?

821
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
I don't think it's her.

822
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
You think it's Xinxin?

823
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,600
Do you know why I don't think it's a tower?

824
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,480
Because Tata sent me

825
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,280
English name.

826
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,680
Today I sent

827
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Chinese.

828
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,800
Harry.

829
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
If I knew

830
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,840
I could talk to her so happily today,

831
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,000
I would pick her during the day.

832
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,120
I had a good chat too.

833
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,280
But we are

834
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,840
we are very similar.

835
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,880
We are really

836
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,280
not very similar.

837
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,560
but they complement each other.

838
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,480
I'm just like

839
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,200
is exactly the same as Tae-seo.

840
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,080
I think he's my brother, you know?

841
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,639
I think he's my brother.

842
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,480
We have the same frequency.

843
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,440
We look alike.

844
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,520
That kind of brother.

845
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,360
So you're more biased

846
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,920
more tarot.

847
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,480
Esther is more.

848
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,120
It's quite complicated.

849
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,199
I think I'll choose a tower anyway.

850
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,639
How do you feel?

851
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,920
I don't know who sent it to me.

852
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,199
I know.

853
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,560
It must be soup.

854
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,800
If you say that,

855
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,480
Why?

856
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,000
Because he told me that

857
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
ordinary content.

858
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,639
I can guess what you wrote.

859
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,800
You probably can't guess it.

860
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
It's plain.

861
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,440
It must be soup.

862
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,400
Do you regret it?

863
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,960
Both of us are like…

864
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,920
Or...

865
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,280
After the whole day,

866
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,600
and soup during the day,

867
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,120
he took care of me.

868
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,200
He fell 80 times.

869
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
and helped me 80 times.

870
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,040
What am I doing?

871
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,560
Don't fall down. Slow down.

872
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,400
I saw it.

873
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,680
What should I do?

874
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm frustrated.

875
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm really frustrated.

876
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,560
When I knew

877
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,440
this letter was sent by soup,

878
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,840
after the soup was sent.

879
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,120
Ask?

880
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Or you go by yourself?

881
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,840
I'll think about it.

882
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,240
Think about it.

883
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,920
Yes.

884
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,400
Is it fun?

885
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,880
Is it getting interesting?

886
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,440
You can't sleep well in the soup.

887
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,840
Yes.

888
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
Go.

889
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
Give him a hand cream.

890
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,080
Soup.

891
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,480
He thinks about all the bad things.

892
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
in his mind. Yes.

893
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,120
And you blame yourself.

894
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,640
Right.

895
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,080
I don't understand.

896
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm just sad.

897
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
It's helpless.

898
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,840
Come and save us!

899
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
Coming.

900
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,240
Are you busy?

901
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,640
Are you free?

902
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,920
Just wait.

903
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,160
Okay.

904
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,280
He refused.

905
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,680
It means he's really angry.

906
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,640
Really.

907
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,120
I can feel it.

908
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,600
he doesn't want to talk about

909
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,640
about this.

910
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,400
The two of them

911
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,840
should take the initiative.

912
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,920
or it's over.

913
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,760
Yes.

914
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,880
Do you want to talk? No. Bye.

915
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,680
Yes.

916
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
He went to write his brother's diary.

917
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,320
He's reading the sheet music.

918
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,800
He was covering his face with a piano score.

919
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,640
I think

920
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,680
she doesn't like me very much.

921
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,920
I never

922
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,080
contact many people.

923
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,480
and pessimistic children.

924
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,000
I've given you everything I have.

925
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
I gave everything I had.

926
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,840
But she might not choose me.

927
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,880
It's a pity.

928
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,120
I wonder

929
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
I think what happened these days

930
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,680
is quite fake.

931
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
His personality

932
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,560
overturn everything that happened in the past.

933
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,360
everything related to him.

934
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
But there is one possibility

935
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,320
After tonight,

936
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
he won't go there tomorrow.

937
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,040
He closed the door.

938
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,520
Yes.

939
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,200
I think it's also a challenge for Susu.

940
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,360
Because you want to see Susu.

941
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,280
She might be the one who gives it to you.

942
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,640
She wouldn't have thought of so many stories behind.

943
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,280
But the person she met

944
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Soup again.

945
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,480
This is their fate.

946
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,040
This music is great.

947
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,160
Croatia Reverie begins.

948
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm going crazy.

949
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
I think I did something wrong.

950
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,120
Look.

951
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,520
Where is Susu going?

952
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,840
Again.

953
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
Susu is so brave.

954
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,760
How is it?

955
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm fine.

956
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,320
Okay.

957
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,600
Where are we going?

958
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,720
This way.

959
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,120
Susu knows him well.

960
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,480
I know he's fragile.

961
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,400
Did you send it to me today?

962
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
I chose to send it to Tae-seo today

963
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,280
because

964
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
when we were eating,

965
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,160
we said we were like

966
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,080
He's my brother.

967
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,440
Guoguo is my brother.

968
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Guoguo is my brother.

969
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,040
I'm his sister.

970
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,480
And

971
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,160
I think it's not good

972
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,720
on his birthday.

973
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,760
If today is my birthday,

974
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,920
on my birthday,

975
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,000
I might

976
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
send this thing

977
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,160
sent this.

978
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,040
But he turned me down.

979
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
And

980
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,680
As you can see,

981
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,760
I feel uncomfortable

982
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,360
I feel uncomfortable all day.

983
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
And I feel awkward.

984
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I'll be very sad.

985
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Actually, before I went on a date,

986
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,240
I would send this message to him.

987
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,800
But the message I sent is...

988
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,360
I'm sorry I rejected you this afternoon.

989
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,560
And happy birthday to you again.

990
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
But...

991
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm afraid you'll think too much.

992
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,440
It's really not polite.

993
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,800
Yes.

994
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,960
Good communication.

995
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm struggling.

996
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
I've been struggling for a long time.

997
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't want

998
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,200
who will be in a bad mood because of me.

999
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,000
But I may

1000
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,800
ignored my real thoughts.

1001
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,040
I think

1002
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,480
this text doesn't mean

1003
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,880
send it to whoever you love more.

1004
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,080
I think

1005
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,200
I should send it to him.

1006
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,240
Don't you have anything to say?

1007
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,200
No.

1008
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,880
Let's talk tomorrow.

1009
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,120
Can you understand me?

1010
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,160
Not now.

1011
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,160
Not now.

1012
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
Why?

1013
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,200
Isn't this text

1014
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,920
send this message to someone you like?

1015
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,800
From my point of view, you can't.

1016
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,360
She may not be serious.

1017
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,640
to this matter.

1018
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,680
she probably

1019
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,400
I care so much about her.

1020
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,440
or put my feelings

1021
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,960
her consideration.

1022
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,520
I didn't consider

1023
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,680
my real thoughts.

1024
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,720
It's about the feelings.

1025
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,560
It's not a text.

1026
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,920
He's thinking about this text.

1027
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,120
He doesn't care about

1028
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,600
you don't care about my feelings more.

1029
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,880
You're so stubborn.

1030
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
So I didn't want you to misunderstand.

1031
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,120
I feel like I did something wrong.

1032
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,680
I just...

1033
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
feel guilty.

1034
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
You...

1035
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,600
more interested

1036
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,400
in him.

1037
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Where do you think so?

1038
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,560
When there are many people,

1039
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,080
your attention might be on him.

1040
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,400
When?

1041
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,200
Let's talk tomorrow.

1042
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,720
You don't want to talk to me?

1043
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,160
I want to sleep.

1044
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,320
Don't run away.

1045
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,240
Hold him down. Don't let him run away.

1046
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,920
Okay.

1047
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,480
Let's talk tomorrow.

1048
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,760
Will we talk tomorrow?

1049
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,040
Really?

1050
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,240
Will you be unhappy?

1051
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,440
You sleep at night,

1052
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,080
Are you upset

1053
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,960
Are you unhappy?

1054
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't think so.

1055
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm going back to wash up.

1056
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,000
Okay.

1057
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,720
Sleep early.

1058
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,000
I hope you can think about

1059
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,080
what I told you today.

1060
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,680
Okay?

1061
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,320
Okay.

1062
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,080
Good night. Go to sleep.

1063
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,720
But Susu is brave. She's great.

1064
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,400
She said she was wrong.

1065
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,480
Susu is great.

1066
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
Girls look great like this.

1067
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,240
I think girls are like this.

1068
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,200
Don't worry. I know it too well.

1069
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,880
He's just like me.

1070
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,080
just like me.

1071
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,600
stubborn.

1072
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,280
I always fight with myself.

1073
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,720
I often fan myself because of this.

1074
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,200
No, if you

1075
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,920
the more you give him,

1076
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,520
The more he doesn't pick up,

1077
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,160
just ignore him.

1078
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,800
Just ignore him.

1079
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,760
He'll be fine soon.

1080
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,360
I think the soup

1081
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,440
his growth environment

1082
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,480
is very strict.

1083
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Strict.

1084
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,520
Very good, very strict.

1085
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,720
such a growth environment.

1086
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,680
So Soup has some

1087
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
about himself.

1088
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,200
But he's actually excellent.

1089
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:38,680
Yes.

1090
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,040
So in a relationship,

1091
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,640
he has low confidence in himself.

1092
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,280
That's why he has

1093
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,840
over-thinking.

1094
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,760
Yes.

1095
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,120
So he proved his incompetence.

1096
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,960
So now he

1097
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,680
with a stick.

1098
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,840
I'm not outstanding.

1099
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,240
That's why she doesn't like me.

1100
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,840
and collected everything for her own judgment.

1101
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,240
to prove that I'm not good.

1102
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Yes.

1103
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,680
So he can't hear anything else now.

1104
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,640
What a pity.

1105
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,920
Look, many beautiful love

1106
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,200
are missed like this.

1107
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,320
But he has to go through this process.

1108
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,240
You've already chosen.

1109
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,880
Right?

1110
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,560
You've already chosen.

1111
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,680
I don't know if I'm right.

1112
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,080
After you came back today,

1113
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,400
when you came back today?

1114
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,920
Yes.

1115
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,000
After today's chat,

1116
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,520
I feel I'm like her.

1117
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,800
I don't know if this is

1118
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,120
I'm just imagining things.

1119
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,000
I said everything.

1120
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh no, he heard this again.

1121
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,280
I heard it in my ears again.

1122
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,240
On a date

1123
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,360
and talked a lot.

1124
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,560
Then I said you don't have to say.

1125
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,840
I know the answer.

1126
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:39,720
Good.

1127
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,760
I think it's good.

1128
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,400
What's wrong?

1129
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,000
Tata is here.

1130
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,680
I have a task for you.

1131
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,360
What?

1132
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,560
Get it some water.

1133
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,080
Sure.

1134
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,880
Take this upstairs and put it in your room.

1135
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,080
What's this?

1136
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
humidifier.

1137
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,640
Okay.

1138
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
So good.

1139
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,760
Take a cup.

1140
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,120
It doesn't drink.

1141
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,280
It needs flowing water.

1142
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,000
I almost thought

1143
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,080
you bought it a drink machine.

1144
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,600
I bought it a water machine.

1145
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,480
It's an automatic drinking machine.

1146
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,960
Xinxin is here.

1147
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,040
I don't think so.

1148
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,200
I said I shouldn't.

1149
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,080
It was so fun today.

1150
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,200
What?

1151
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,360
Interesting.

1152
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,320
What's wrong?

1153
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,760
He's not talking at all.

1154
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,960
Ignore him.

1155
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,240
Let's go.

1156
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,960
It's gone.

1157
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,880
It's gone.

1158
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,480
Is it a cat or a human?

1159
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,400
One word and two words.

1160
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,200
Sit there and talk.

1161
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,160
Okay.

1162
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,400
You sent it to me three times.

1163
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,000
Okay, stop it.

1164
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,840
I'm leaving. It's so awkward.

1165
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,800
Whether it's a letter

1166
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
or text.

1167
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,320
I'm glad you know. I'm leaving.

1168
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,120
I'm sorry.

1169
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,240
Why did you say it out loud?

1170
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,920
It's awkward.

1171
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,120
There's no one else.

1172
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,160
That sounds so ambiguous.

1173
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,840
I'm here.

1174
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,240
Tell me.

1175
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,720
And today you said why I gave it to you.

1176
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,600
Well...

1177
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:55,840
No.

1178
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,400
That was unconsciously speaking out.

1179
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,200
It was subconsciously.

1180
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,440
I was too subconsciously.

1181
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,320
If you really think

1182
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,240
If you don't like it,

1183
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm just embarrassed.

1184
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,800
Because you can feel

1185
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,280
what my mouth looks like.

1186
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,560
From the first day to today,

1187
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,320
they think I’m E.

1188
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,800
But I think when we talk,

1189
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
when we talk.

1190
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,480
Let's go.

1191
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,000
It's so dramatic.

1192
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,720
Bye.

1193
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
She's good at it.

1194
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,920
Yes, she left as soon as she did.

1195
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,840
Yes.

1196
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,760
I think

1197
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,280
this text doesn't mean

1198
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,200
send it to whoever you love more.

1199
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,440
I think

1200
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,680
I should send it to him.

1201
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,520
I don't want anyone to be upset because of me.

1202
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,320
But I may

1203
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,800
ignored my real thoughts.

1204
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,440
I feel like I did something wrong.

1205
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,640
I feel guilty.

1206
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,040
The soup is killing me.

1207
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,320
Look at everyone's sad posture

1208
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,720
It's the same.

1209
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,920
No one is suffering in big shape.

1210
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,160
Everyone is in this style.

1211
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,040
Harry, he came back from a date.

1212
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,920
He chatted with soup.

1213
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,280
I came out

1214
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,160
He's chatting with Tata.

1215
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,600
It was so fun today.

1216
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,680
What's wrong?

1217
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,240
I chatted with everyone.

1218
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,720
He didn't say a word to me.

1219
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,600
This episode

1220
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,160
we are

1221
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,840
too dramatic.

1222
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,800
I didn't expect

1223
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,840
Not at all.

1224
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,760
Harry

1225
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,440
(he's slowly siding with Tata.)

1226
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,560
Sue and soup.

1227
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,120
There are many misunderstandings because of Terri.

1228
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,400
Our members

1229
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,760
has changed

1230
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,320
in emotions.

1231
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,080
So everyone has made

1232
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,200
a new choice.

1233
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,680
Do you prefer

1234
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,200
in love?

1235
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,720
Super active.

1236
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,920
When I like someone,

1237
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,520
I'm an attacker.

1238
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,600
Cool.

1239
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,800
Like I said before,

1240
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,600
I was rejected by you.

1241
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,440
I drew a cross

1242
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,560
on the blackboard.

1243
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,520
Yes.

1244
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,760
I will take the initiative

1245
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,400
my feelings.

1246
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,560
I hope you don't like me.

1247
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:45,960
Bye.

1248
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,480
But you have to ask the result.

1249
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:47,840
Yes.

1250
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,880
I don't waste any time.

1251
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,760
I'm actually confident

1252
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,440
is actually more confident.

1253
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,600
He's not good at saying that

1254
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,880
because he was rejected.

1255
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,360
and dare not attack.

1256
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,200
because he knows

1257
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,800
once he fails,

1258
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,160
he will be very self-conscious.

1259
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,120
doubt.

1260
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,520
Actually,

1261
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,160
to take the initiative.

1262
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,400
If I don't think

1263
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,560
a 100% result and incident,

1264
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,880
I'm actually like soup.

1265
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,240
In this case,

1266
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,120
I might also think about quitting.

1267
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,920
I think it's not love enough.

1268
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,840
No.

1269
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,520
It would be the same if I really like him.

1270
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,240
If you like her,

1271
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,320
you want to pursue her,

1272
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,920
You want her to be your girlfriend.

1273
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,000
Of course you will.

1274
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,120
take the initiative.

1275
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,600
Yes.

1276
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,920
You'll have strong internal force.

1277
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,280
Yes. Are you waiting for her to pursue you?

1278
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,480
But Huang Zifan meant to...

1279
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,240
He was 100% sure

1280
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,440
That's what he thinks.

1281
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,000
But I think

1282
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,360
if you don't take that step,

1283
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,440
how can you be sure

1284
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,800
if he's the one you're pursuing.

1285
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,200
Because love between people

1286
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,560
must be clearer in getting along.

1287
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,400
But if you are always passive

1288
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,920
or walk out,

1289
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,040
how do you know if he's suitable for you?

1290
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,280
This is important.

1291
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,720
I think we must get out.

1292
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,960
It's scientific pursuit of handsome men and beauties.

1293
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,600
Don't be too aggressive when you pursue her.

1294
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,440
You scared me away.

1295
00:53:59,440 --> 00:53:59,840
Yes.

1296
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,040
Throw it and see if he'll answer.

1297
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,720
One more time.

1298
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,080
Yes.

1299
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,360
Keep going back and forth.

1300
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,240
Yes.

1301
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,440
But there is someone

1302
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,920
who may feel insecure.

1303
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,040
We'll test her.

1304
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,200
and see how she reacts.

1305
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,600
When you do something, look at her.

1306
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,680
Sometimes when you're next to her,

1307
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,960
you get a little closer to her.

1308
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,080
Then she suddenly withdrew.

1309
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,520
I was so disappointed.

1310
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,280
That's it.

1311
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,600
But we took the initiative.

1312
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,840
No, but we actually

1313
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,040
in our hearts.

1314
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,200
and try it secretly.

1315
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,680
Yes, he won't say it.

1316
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,200
Yes.

1317
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,440
I'm an observant type.

1318
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,640
If I have a girl

1319
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,080
in a relationship like this,

1320
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,040
I may observe her first.

1321
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,760
If she keeps talking to a guy,

1322
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,840
I'll be doomed.

1323
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,480
Maybe she likes that guy.

1324
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,240
If she doesn't like to talk like me,

1325
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,920
What are you talking about?

1326
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,160
If I can still be attracted to her,

1327
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,000
she can

1328
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,320
give you some feedback.

1329
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,000
or you can laugh at her from time to time.

1330
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,440
And she may

1331
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,520
give you some response.

1332
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,840
I think

1333
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,400
there may be

1334
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,360
20 percent.

1335
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,440
Then I will

1336
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,120
put some strength on my hair.

1337
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,040
It seems to have something for me.

1338
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,320
Dunhan is a passive type.

1339
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,040
He needs to feel it first to attack.

1340
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,000
But you have to think

1341
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,600
She might think

1342
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,760
you have no feelings for her.

1343
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,240
Because you think she

1344
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
she doesn't react to you.

1345
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,480
You don't react to her either.

1346
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,640
she might think

1347
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,480
you have no feelings for her.

1348
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,320
Is this a tongue twister?

1349
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,040
It's a detour.

1350
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,280
Sometimes, I just need one look.

1351
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,600
I'm sure

1352
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,480
she was peeping at you.

1353
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,560
Then you'll know.

1354
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,080
Maybe she likes you.

1355
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,520
Yes.

1356
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,800
This is mutual.

1357
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,280
Yes.

1358
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
If someone doesn't say anything,

1359
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,560
if they don't say anything,

1360
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,240
is usually a failure.

1361
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,360
Yes, love boorish.

1362
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,320
Do you hear me?

1363
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,160
Okay.

1364
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,120
I'll never receive a fork again.

1365
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,880
For the next episode,

1366
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,240
(We'll have a protective date for boys.)

1367
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,640
They will accept

1368
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,480
in the room of Mirror.

1369
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,840
the girl's brother.

1370
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,880
Let's look forward to it.

1371
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,320
Okay.

1372
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,440
That's all for this episode.

1373
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Love Siblings.

1374
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,960
Let love double.

1375
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,360
Boys' guardian date

1376
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,640
have been invited.

1377
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,320
The siblings invited by many boys

1378
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,360
to the Mirror House.

1379
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,640
Is she your first choice?

1380
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,560
Why didn't she receive

1381
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,320
her feelings?

1382
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,520
Can you feel

1383
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,440
her happy moments?

1384
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
If this date

1385
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,080
this date successfully,

1386
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,400
how would you feel?
