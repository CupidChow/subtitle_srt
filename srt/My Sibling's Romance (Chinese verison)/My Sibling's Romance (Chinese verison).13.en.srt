1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
A party with wild wine

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull, refreshing and breathing.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,120
It's like drinking wild wine

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,160
It's as fluffy as a skull. My scalp will breathe.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,120
will watch Love Brothers first.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,680
will watch Love Sisters first.

11
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,920
I hope so.

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,360
A map.

13
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,479
My first impression

14
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,120
He is "Happy Puppy".

15
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,160
He is very good at organizing games.

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,000
and interactions with everyone.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
It won't make the atmosphere awkward.

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
If we can go on a date together,

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,600
we can be very happy.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,840
and relaxed.

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
Actually, when I received

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
when I received

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,360
I was very happy.

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
So I'm looking forward to

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
Who are you going on a date with?

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,360
Hello.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
Hello

28
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,200
The first second I saw the map,

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
I felt

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
put down the stone in my heart.

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,280
He walked in like a rabbit.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
He looks energetic.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,680
Did you guess it was me?

34
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
Guess if I knew it was you.

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,360
I think you are so smart.

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
you should be able to guess.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
A little bit.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,600
Okay.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,000
The first time I saw her,

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
I was very happy and surprised.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Because she basically has curly hair in front of her.

42
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,040
She has a smooth straight hair today.

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
There's a contrast.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,920
If it were you,

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
if you choose,

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,680
who do you want to be with?

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,079
When I first came in,

48
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,880
I...

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
you were the last one to come in.

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,960
You suddenly said

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
your ears were so big.

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,079
You suddenly called me.

53
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,079
Your ears were too obvious.

54
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,800
When I look at you now,

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,720
I can't take my eyes away.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
because of my ears.

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
I was shocked.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,040
I said,

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,240
Esther can

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,880
such a reaction.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,960
At that time,

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,120
impression and favourite.

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,120
So when I compliment your ears,

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
when I compliment your ears.

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,840
No.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,079
It's just that

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,200
Many people

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,760
Yes.

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,680
Thank you.

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
This is huge.

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
You start first.

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
I also want to eat this dish first.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,000
Because I know you like it.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,680
It's really spicy.

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
This is a dough twist.

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,800
I love spicy food.

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Sure.

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,520
I like Sichuan cuisine. Hunan cuisine.

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,080
Me too.

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Sichuan cuisine. Hunan cuisine.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
Guizhou cuisine is also delicious.

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Guizhou cuisine

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,480
It's delicious.

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Especially that potato.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Well

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Chicken stewed with potatoes

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,760
Potatoes are bad

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,360
Yes.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,360
Don't you want this ice cream?

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
Let me try it for you.

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,080
Is it good?

92
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
But greasy.

93
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
But it's not ice cream.

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
We work hard.

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,000
If you...

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
if

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,760
have such a crush,

98
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
would you talk to her?

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm actually

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
a person who depends on the feeling.

101
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,880
But I think

102
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
more importantly, when we get along

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,440
or chatting,

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,160
I think

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
you and I

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,880
we are quite compatible.

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,840
Or our daily routine and hobbies

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
are very compatible.

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
and daily routine.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
So you sleep early and get up early?

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,000
No.

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,880
Sleep and wake up late.

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
Something like that.

114
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,720
What if...

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
If...

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
if you have

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,920
you have a crush on,

118
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,400
But your siblings

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
doesn't suit you.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,159
or let you see it again.

121
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,840
Will you listen to her

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
or move forward bravely?

123
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
I think we'll listen to it.

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,560
Listen

125
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
I do.

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
But I don't think you can change my mind.

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,480
Like this.

128
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,640
It's up to you.

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,120
But you will listen to her

130
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
and then think about it yourself.

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Yes.

132
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm not that kind of person.

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
A brother.

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Yes.

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,080
You can replace him.

136
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Got it.

137
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,560
You want to be with the person you like.

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,640
You're very determined.

139
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,159
Or is there a girl who likes you?

140
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,600
You'll be moved too.

141
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
You really asked me.

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
Because there were few cases

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,640
in the past.

144
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,760
Case?

145
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Yes.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,600
That means you have no relationship experience.

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
Yes.

148
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
You can think about

149
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,160
what I like.

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,200
Right?

151
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
I really can't think of it.

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,880
I might have to experience it again.

153
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,840
After that,

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,360
you may think

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
what kind of person

156
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
when you're with someone.

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,640
I feel like my sister is here with you.

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
I don't want to be a teacher.

159
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Actually, these things are...

160
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,800
I can understand these things.

161
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,480
And why did I

162
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,480
at the beginning?

163
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Because I think you are very similar to my sister.

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
I'm like a brother to Tu.

165
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,040
Because I feel like

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,560
from his brother's perspective.

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
what kind of girl you like.

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,920
It's okay.

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,480
I feel that

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,280
I don't know why

171
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
It's very similar.

172
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,000
and open-minded.

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,160
Have you ever liked a girl older than you?

174
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,920
Yes.

175
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Actually, I think

176
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,480
I don't have a specific type.

177
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
I think you are the right person.

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,600
or I feel comfortable with you.

179
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
I think that's me.

180
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
I can contact.

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,680
It's like this.

182
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
It depends on the feeling.

183
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,160
Yes.

184
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,280
If you're cute,

185
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
you can...

186
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes.

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Indeed.

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Kill you.

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,920
Got it.

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,400
And I think

191
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
you are a very detailed person.

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
You will remember many details.

193
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,400
Like you said,

194
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,720
your sister will cook for you.

195
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:34,960
Yes.

196
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
I don't remember at all.

197
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I remember everything.

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,240
If I had to remember one thing,

199
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,520
I will definitely

200
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,840
For example, what clothes are you wearing today

201
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,600
What are you wearing?

202
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,280
necklace or something.

203
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,640
I can remember it.

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
The exam is tomorrow.

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,960
Okay.

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,040
In a few days,

207
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,280
Next week.

208
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,520
Yellow powder dust.

209
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,360
Okay.

210
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,720
So,

211
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,520
you don't care about the girl you like.

212
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,880
You're a person who cares a lot.

213
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,400
Yes, I am.

214
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm not saying

215
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I want to show everyone my charm.

216
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,480
And

217
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
I want to be the central air conditioner.

218
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,520
What do I want?

219
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,040
"Three-timing"?

220
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,680
I really didn't.

221
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,520
I just...

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,800
You must be scared.

223
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
We were just joking.

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,480
Because you have a good personality.

225
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
and you're good at expressing emotions.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,320
Yes.

227
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,200
I know you're joking.

228
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,440
I had a good chat with Tu today.

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,960
I feel that

230
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,640
at first,

231
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
the first time we met

232
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,200
comes from his liveliness.

233
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
After getting to know him,

234
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,600
I feel this kind of relationship is like a good friend.

235
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Like sister and brother.

236
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Through today's date,

237
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,120
makes my heart flutter.

238
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Because I think

239
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,720
she is a very generous person.

240
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,000
She can joke with you.

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
she can also keep it.

242
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
She also expresses

243
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,520
in this way

244
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,120
her feelings.

245
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:53,880
So,

246
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,800
I will give her some feedback.

247
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,440
In the future,

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
I will pay more attention

249
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
the habits of our life

250
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,400
or hobbies.

251
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,040
We're about the same.

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
Okay, let's go.

253
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
Cupid's invitation card.

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
I filled in Harry.

255
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,880
The reason I gave Xinxin

256
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,960
I thought Harry was her brother.

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,680
Before we set off today,

258
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,040
I did my hair.

259
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,280
I chose a suit for myself.

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Hello.

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
Hello.

262
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,280
The result is the same as I expected.

263
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,040
The first person I wanted to date

264
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,480
is Hua.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Order something.

266
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,920
Okay.

267
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,720
What do you want to eat?

268
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,240
Take a look.

269
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
Let's order a mousse.

270
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,200
and Swiss rolls.

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
Which one do you want, mousse? Sea salt.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Butter.

273
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,560
Sea salt.

274
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,400
I want to ask you a question.

275
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
You asked me a question as soon as you came.

276
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Soul torture.

277
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,320
The moment you gave me my brother,

278
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
you knew it was me?

279
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
Did you guess one thing?

280
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,960
I saw her in front of the restaurant.

281
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Then I laughed.

282
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,480
When I saw her, she was smiling too.

283
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
And I think

284
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
I don't think it'll be rude.

285
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
So I asked this question at the beginning.

286
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
When we first entered,

287
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,520
Harry took over

288
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
the whole housework.

289
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,400
When we are cooking,

290
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,360
Then we need to write

291
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
"Pitt's Heart Card".

292
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,000
I thought

293
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
Xinxin

294
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,360
It's Harry's sister.

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,280
So you thought it was Harry at first.

296
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,800
Yes.

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,840
On the first day, I thought

298
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
But yesterday

299
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,680
my mind might have changed.

300
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
So I guessed again.

301
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,000
She said she thought

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,560
she wrote Harry first.

303
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,160
I was a little disappointed.

304
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
At that moment,

305
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
I thought my "Cupid" cut

306
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
is not because of the first sight,

307
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,400
but because you might get it wrongly.

308
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
I think, OK.

309
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,160
On the first day,

310
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
I didn't know anything about my siblings.

311
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,040
Harry and that...

312
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,680
Yes, Susu or me?

313
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm thinking about it too.

314
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,920
Can you confirm it now?

315
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,800
I can confirm it now.

316
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Can you confirm it?

317
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,680
100 percent?

318
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,720
I looked at the map behind you.

319
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,240
It looks quite similar.

320
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
I thought it was too late.

321
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,560
that I look like the map.

322
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,320
When I first came in,

323
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,800
when I just came in?

324
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Because on the first day,

325
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,920
he and Susu had a tacit understanding.

326
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
The map and Susu have a tacit understanding.

327
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
Didn't we play games?

328
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
Because we have a tacit understanding.

329
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,360
Can you tell?

330
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,640
Not at all.

331
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
Not at all.

332
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,840
I didn't even think you two look alike.

333
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,080
I thought you and Susu

334
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
Because both of you

335
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
are taller.

336
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,280
Harry and Xinxin

337
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,320
are short.

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
I thought if the genetic probability

339
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,920
it should be you and Susu.

340
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,440
Yes.

341
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,960
I was completely sure on the first day.

342
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm really confident that

343
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,800
you and Susu are siblings.

344
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,960
So you gave the wrong one.

345
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,760
It's not wrong.

346
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
Now sitting here, you...

347
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,560
Because on the first day,

348
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,480
I didn't have much contact with Fatty.

349
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,040
Later,

350
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,880
we didn't go shopping at the supermarket.

351
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,120
and communicate more with Fatty.

352
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,920
I want to know more about Fatty.

353
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,280
So after yesterday's contact,

354
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,960
I'll do it today.

355
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,640
After meeting yesterday,

356
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,040
I think this afternoon tea is right.

357
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,880
Not at all.

358
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,760
Not at all.

359
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
I went to the supermarket yesterday

360
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,200
I said I wanted to eat this.

361
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
You said you wanted to buy it.

362
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,160
You were at the supermarket too.

363
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,160
What do you want to buy?

364
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,960
Just tell me.

365
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,720
He walked through the curls first.

366
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,760
He said,

367
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,880
Curls should be good at making breakfast.

368
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,800
No one cares about him.

369
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,960
I thought he would take it himself.

370
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,840
But the second time,

371
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,400
we went to that circle together.

372
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,000
He said,

373
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,720
I think we can

374
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
eat this breakfast.

375
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I know he wants it.

376
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,240
but no one responded.

377
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,480
I said take it.

378
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,320
But I am

379
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,920
When I'm hesitating,

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
when I hesitated.

381
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,800
Because I'm not very independent.

382
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,400
I want to be recognized.

383
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,520
When I doubted it,

384
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,880
I asked if I wanted this.

385
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
Then you say you want it right away.

386
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,080
So...

387
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,880
In the past,

388
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,560
basically we can get the map.

389
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,720
No one will say

390
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
Hua, you can take whatever you want.

391
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
Did you buy too much chili sauce?

392
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,160
No everyone likes it

393
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,800
One more.

394
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,320
Take it.

395
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
When he said I could take it,

396
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,720
I think it's a kind of recognition for me.

397
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
I feel very warm.

398
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
I saw Susu there.

399
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
take whatever she wants.

400
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,680
Yes.

401
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,360
I think you're a girl too.

402
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
You can take it too.

403
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,440
It's nothing. Just take it.

404
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,240
According to the day we went to the supermarket,

405
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,880
she said she didn't make the wrong appointment.

406
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
I was happy at that moment.

407
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
That means

408
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,520
I bought her

409
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,920
was the right choice.

410
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,960
Cheers.

411
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,480
Cheers

412
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,440
Why not?

413
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,720
A cup will do.

414
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,320
When the three of us

415
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
sitting there together yesterday,

416
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,240
we asked you about the black mask.

417
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,280
Your black mask scared me.

418
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,640
Can I have one?

419
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,320
No.

420
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,160
You just said you can only be biased.

421
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
You didn't apply it for the three of us.

422
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,319
Xiao Ling wasn't there.

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,119
not for Xiaoling.

424
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,520
The three of us asked if you could.

425
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
You said you could only be biased.

426
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
And you refused to give us three.

427
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,280
Only Xiaoling is not here.

428
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,160
You think I can't?

429
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
I want to give it to Xiaoling.

430
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,119
She doesn't need that face.

431
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,079
So we need her, right?

432
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,360
You're really...

433
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,960
No.

434
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,080
I mean she's not here.

435
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
I won't leave it to her.

436
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,320
So what I said

437
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,400
I want to give someone

438
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,040
But you didn't answer the next one.

439
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,440
Because the three of us knew it.

440
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
So I dropped my words.

441
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,640
When you came to my room,

442
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
I asked you

443
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,640
Susu said one thing.

444
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,160
Then I asked you

445
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,800
if you want to

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,920
Fatty.

447
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
Look at your black mask.

448
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,120
What? Do you want to try?

449
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,280
You didn't understand my point.

450
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you want some?

451
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,960
Have some.

452
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
We'll go back later.

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,240
We should have dinner together.

454
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
We can eat more tonight.

455
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,760
Why can we eat more tonight

456
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,640
Because the chef is good at cooking, right?

457
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes, it's their turn to cook tonight

458
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,320
Yes.

459
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
Who did the dishes today?

460
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,680
It might be you or the drawing today.

461
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,040
Can you come over and check?

462
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,240
Yes.

463
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Can you help me?

464
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
No need.

465
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,600
We can enjoy ourselves today.

466
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,520
Sit there and watch.

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
It's them today.

468
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,760
So are you someone who worries?

469
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
I won't worry if someone is here.

470
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,600
In love,

471
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
in love?

472
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,720
I don't know.

473
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,920
You know it yourself.

474
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
Let me tell you.

475
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,120
I'll tell you everything.

476
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,560
Can we have a chat?

477
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,000
Because I think Harry is going today.

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
I don't have to worry at all.

479
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,600
So you wanted to observe

480
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
Harry and...

481
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,400
Me?

482
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
This is your first impression.

483
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,440
Yes.

484
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,160
Because

485
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
The soup is my first impression.

486
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,240
Very handsome and tall.

487
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,280
But the soup

488
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,640
He doesn't talk.

489
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,600
So you like to talk more with you.

490
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,440
Be cheerful.

491
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,720
What do you mean?

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
I think

493
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,200
Really.

494
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,280
I'll go back for dinner later.

495
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,760
Okay.

496
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,880
Save some stomach.

497
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Harry will say we don't give him face.

498
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,240
He's eating so much outside.

499
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,480
Let's go.

500
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,240
Did you drive?

501
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
I drove.

502
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,080
Take my car.

503
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,600
Okay.

504
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
If you grade this date today,

505
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,120
you can get 95 points.

506
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,880
Because usually,

507
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm the one who speaks.

508
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,760
Yes.

509
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,640
But today I feel Fatty is leading me.

510
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm grateful to him too.

511
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,440
The snow is so romantic.

512
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,280
Aren't you coming down?

513
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,360
You're going down.

514
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Let's go down.

515
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,320
Let's go down and have a look.

516
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,320
You...

517
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,000
Good evening.

518
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Do you want a photo?

519
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Let me take a photo for you.

520
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
I'll take two for you.

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
My phone is really nice.

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,520
It's like...

523
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
Why don't you wear more?

524
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's okay.

525
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
Really?

526
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm really fine.

527
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
Cold legs.

528
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,560
Watch out!

529
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,000
Let me take a photo for you.

530
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,960
I'll take two for you.

531
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,640
Let me see.

532
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,680
I'll go down.

533
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
Go over there.

534
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,320
I'll find it for you.

535
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,840
Okay.

536
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,800
A little bit to the side. Don't move.

537
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,400
Just move slowly.

538
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,840
My phone is a bit old.

539
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Why don't we just take a few photos?

540
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,440
I'll take it for you.

541
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,360
Put your chin in.

542
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,160
A little bit.

543
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,880
That's it.

544
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,080
I'll find the light.

545
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't laugh.

546
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
You look like a stiff robot.

547
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,600
Don't move.

548
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Stand here.

549
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Okay.

550
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,800
In front of the light,

551
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,600
Are you cold, Susu?

552
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,760
Let me get you a coat.

553
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,920
Where is it?

554
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,360
It's in the jacket.

555
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
Is it white

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,960
White down jacket

557
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,040
It's snowing heavily.

558
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,800
You need to put on your clothes.

559
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
One more?

560
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
It's okay. I don't wear it when I take photos.

561
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,720
I'll take it for you.

562
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,600
I'll hold it for you.

563
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,680
Thank you.

564
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,040
Then you can finish it.

565
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,440
Wait.

566
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
It's huge.

567
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,360
What?

568
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,280
No, I think it's fun.

569
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,480
I feel happy.

570
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
It's snowing heavily.

571
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,920
It's really on my face.

572
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,320
Look up.

573
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
It's snowing heavily.

574
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,600
Turn around.

575
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,400
But my left face is pretty.

576
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,480
I couldn't hold it.

577
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,040
Sorry.

578
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,960
It's okay.

579
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,840
When I took a picture of her,

580
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,800
in the snow,

581
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,960
in the snow.

582
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,240
Is it stiff?

583
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,920
Maybe she's pretty.

584
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
It might not look good.

585
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,600
What?

586
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,240
Take a photo for me.

587
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,240
It's too stiff.

588
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
What should I do?

589
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,840
Stand here.

590
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,320
I'll go around you.

591
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,520
That's it.

592
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,200
MV.

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
You like MV, right?

594
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
No.

595
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,960
Give it back.

596
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
The way we get along

597
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,560
more relaxed.

598
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,120
He keeps asking me if I'm cold.

599
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,080
Should I wear something?

600
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,960
He even took my phone.

601
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,760
and took my clothes.

602
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,880
That's it.

603
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,160
is a bonus to me.

604
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,520
It's like a drama.

605
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,440
watching the snow together,

606
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,560
I think they stand there

607
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,480
They look great together.

608
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I envy you.

609
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,240
It's too cold.

610
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
I can't stand it.

611
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm going up.

612
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,960
Are you still wearing it?

613
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,840
Shall we go in first?

614
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,600
Let's go.

615
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
I'll put this phone on.

616
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Okay.

617
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,800
I wanted to learn

618
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,760
the sound of snowfall.

619
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,320
I was going to say,

620
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,880
but I failed.

621
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,640
Is it hard to learn?

622
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,320
No.

623
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,160
It doesn't look like this.

624
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,320
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

625
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,360
I don't feel right.

626
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
Let me take a photo for you.

627
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,520
Take a photo.

628
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,400
Great.

629
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Who can play the piano so well?

630
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,240
Who is so talented?

631
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,480
Amazing.

632
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
The emotional value is too great.

633
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,600
Amazing.

634
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,960
Why did you button it?

635
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,480
Are you done playing today?

636
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,560
Little spotted dog.

637
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,920
Little Love Dog.

638
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Good.

639
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,440
Too many talents.

640
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,280
Please keep it.

641
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,080
Thank you.

642
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
Doesn't it look good?

643
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,440
Yes.

644
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
Will you play it?

645
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,920
I don't know how.

646
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Didn't you learn

647
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,200
When I was young,

648
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,520
I forgot.

649
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,840
You can take a photo if you can't.

650
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,200
No.

651
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,320
Too pretentious.

652
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,880
When you were playing,

653
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
Do you know I was up there?

654
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,360
Yes.

655
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
I wanted to keep it down.

656
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,840
But

657
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,560
The louder you step on it,

658
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,480
Then I gave up.

659
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,400
Anything.

660
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,560
Show your charm.

661
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,880
Show.

662
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,920
and charming.

663
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,240
I can't play.

664
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,200
I can't play.

665
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
Yes.

666
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
Someone said he couldn't play the piano.

667
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,320
Someone said he couldn't play the piano.

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,280
Then less than half an hour later,

669
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,920
the performance begins.

670
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,200
A package is at the door.

671
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,320
You can look inside.

672
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,840
You can't ask.

673
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,560
What is this?

674
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
It's like...

675
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,240
Why does it look like space sand?

676
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Truth or Dare.

677
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,880
Truth or Dare.

678
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,760
Okay.

679
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,680
What can you play?

680
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,800
A game other than rock, paper, scissors?

681
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,480
Say one.

682
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,720
The one I play is...

683
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,840
The winner

684
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,440
will win.

685
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,080
I don't understand.

686
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,120
I'm playing

687
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,560
advanced version, a group of smart people.

688
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
You're bullying me.

689
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,000
Because you don't know how to play.

690
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Let's play rock paper scissors.

691
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,560
Rock, paper, scissors.

692
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Scissors.

693
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,480
Okay.

694
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,760
You don't care about money.

695
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
What do you want to do the most?

696
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,960
is actually quite a lot.

697
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,520
Dessert chef.

698
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,600
You want to be a dessert chef?

699
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
Although I don't know how to make dessert,

700
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,680
but it's an open kitchen

701
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
Then the chef cooks

702
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,560
You squeeze cream next to him

703
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,800
You squeeze each part.

704
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,240
It feels very relaxing.

705
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
It's very healing.

706
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,960
Yours.

707
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,200
What?

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,440
Let me see.

709
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Let me see.

710
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
If your friend

711
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,680
No.

712
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
No.

713
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,280
Then do you think the relationship will become strange?

714
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
No.

715
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,400
The first time we met,

716
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,120
I would introduce my friends

717
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,480
and people

718
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,360
I can tell clearly.

719
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,160
If we have become friends,

720
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,720
it means in my heart,

721
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,360
in my heart.

722
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,520
It will never change.

723
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,360
If you can't be with someone,

724
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,520
can we be friends?

725
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,200
What a profound question.

726
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,080
But if I like him,

727
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,200
I might not be able to be friends.

728
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,040
That's why

729
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,920
I don't like him anymore,

730
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,080
I think we can be friends.

731
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
Okay.

732
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,240
It makes sense.

733
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
When you like someone,

734
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
how can you be friends with him?

735
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
It's hard to control this level.

736
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,360
So I think

737
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
friends are friends.

738
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,800
That's impossible.

739
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,960
we've been friends for a long time.

740
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
Then one day, we were together.

741
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,600
In my world,

742
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
in my world.

743
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,920
Or we knew each other before.

744
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,560
But we weren't close.

745
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,480
After we got to know each other,

746
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
it's quite suitable.

747
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Or I like it.

748
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I can date or something.

749
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,760
But if I

750
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
as a friend,

751
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,240
I can't.

752
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,880
Never.

753
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
Impossible.

754
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,000
The bottom line is very high.

755
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,640
I actually felt it at first sight.

756
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,960
I did feel it at first sight.

757
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,680
But I don't take the initiative.

758
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,720
I may not be able to

759
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,760
to give her emotional value.

760
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,080
I will consider many aspects.

761
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,400
But I think love is emotional.

762
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,040
It's not rational.

763
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,560
Maybe sometimes you don't have to think too much.

764
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,680
I should make some changes.

765
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,720
Let's go.

766
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,800
Will you get off from me?

767
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,440
Yes.

768
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,200
Okay, let's go.

769
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
He's not a gentleman.

770
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,400
So cold.

771
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,080
Why is there no snow here?

772
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,760
I just wanted to say

773
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,280
Can you stop stealing my lines?

774
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Right?

775
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,680
Yes.

776
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,760
Why isn't it snowing at all?

777
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,600
Yes.

778
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,480
He even left the door.

779
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,040
Who is so sweet?

780
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,840
So sweet.

781
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,520
Yes.

782
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,240
We're back.

783
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,320
No one is talking to you.

784
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,640
Shut up!

785
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
When will Tu come back?

786
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
He has something to do today.

787
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm leaving, Hua.

788
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,560
Okay, bye.

789
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,240
Bye.

790
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm leaving.

791
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,520
Really?

792
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,560
See you tomorrow.

793
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,000
Bye.

794
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,560
Come back early.

795
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
Bye.

796
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,480
See you tomorrow.

797
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
It's ten o'clock.

798
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,960
Why did I send it to him today?

799
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,120
We had a date today.

800
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,000
After our date,

801
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,840
and get to know more about each other.

802
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Turn around.

803
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,360
But my left face is pretty.

804
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,200
I think some of his parts

805
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,120
he's very careful.

806
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,760
So I will send this message

807
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,520
to him.

808
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,200
I have to guess.

809
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,600
I want to listen to more piano songs in the future.

810
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,320
It's kind of like a forced song.

811
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,160
Maybe I want to listen to "My Tears Smashed".

812
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Maybe

813
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,040
I want to try it with you.

814
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,320
Maybe.

815
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,840
But I think you've sent me your messages.

816
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,160
Isn't this what it means?

817
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,400
It's still different.

818
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,520
I think it may change in this moment.

819
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,480
It's hard.

820
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,400
It's obvious who sent it.

821
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,520
It must be Fatty.

822
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,560
I think it's Hua's message.

823
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm happy to see this message.

824
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,200
Because I think

825
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,920
is the same as mine.

826
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
I think it's probably from Harry.

827
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
Because when we were eating,

828
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,480
when we were eating.

829
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm not embarrassed to eat with you.

830
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,040
That's the topic.

831
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,080
We also talked about

832
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,440
I texted Xiaoling.

833
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,880
I figured it out.

834
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,760
Although it's a good impression,

835
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,360
but there are many kinds of feelings.

836
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,400
I think I can be

837
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,000
with Xiaoling.

838
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,960
So after the text I wrote,

839
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,080
my friend

840
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,480
I guess it might be a map.

841
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,160
from Tu Tu.

842
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,040
During our date today,

843
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,280
we might have shared some things about me.

844
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,840
The map is sensitive.

845
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,320
So in his summary,

846
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,280
I may be a very careful girl.

847
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,920
When the message was sent,

848
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,840
I didn't check my phone.

849
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
I was thinking about something.

850
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,480
What if it's about the guy from yesterday

851
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,400
and the date today,

852
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
Text me at the same time.

853
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,280
What should I do?

854
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,440
So I didn't dare to look.

855
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
What's wrong, Potter?

856
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,360
You're thinking.

857
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
But I don't know how to deal with it.

858
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,280
I sent my message to Harry today.

859
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,200
We had a good chat today.

860
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
and relaxed today.

861
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,480
And I want to express

862
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,960
the feeling of today's experience.

863
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
for a long time.

864
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,680
I was a very tangled person.

865
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,640
Later I thought

866
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,280
Follow my heart.

867
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,040
It's a text message that I understand.

868
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
The person

869
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,320
the guy who likes girls and boys.

870
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,880
I think both of us

871
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,040
are very sensitive.

872
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,920
If his little head is smart,

873
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,200
he should know it's me.

874
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,960
When I saw it,

875
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,120
I think it's the person from yesterday.

876
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,600
sent it to me.

877
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,280
I was happier subconsciously.

878
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
She sent me this message.

879
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
I feel a little disappointed.

880
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,560
I'll try my best to make it up to you tomorrow.

881
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,080
If it doesn't work,

882
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
make ten sandwiches for her.

883
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,680
I wondered why he was so charming.

884
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
I don't understand.

885
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,960
What are you doing?

886
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
I'm not happy.

887
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,480
I thought

888
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
if my brother hadn't received the text,

889
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,480
I would laugh at him.

890
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,720
But when he texted me,

891
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,880
and told me

892
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,640
We're brothers today.

893
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,800
When I didn't receive the text,

894
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,000
I felt quite uncomfortable.

895
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,080
Maybe his shining point

896
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,560
hasn't been discovered yet.

897
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,560
At that time, I looked up at flowers.

898
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,000
I felt that

899
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,120
feel lonely.

900
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,640
I can feel it right away.

901
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,920
Maybe it's because the map didn't receive the message.

902
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,160
I'm a very complicated person.

903
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,920
We haven't talked in private these days.

904
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,400
We

905
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,680
have a lot to say to each other.

906
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,320
Many times,

907
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,120
subconsciously, I said, look.

908
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,360
I want to be like this.

909
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,560
But I can't.

910
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,040
I felt like I was putting up with it and he was putting up with it.

911
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,600
So today I opened

912
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720
the house of siblings.

913
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,280
I have to talk to him.

914
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,560
Fatty.

915
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
Xin.

916
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,680
What were you doing just now?

917
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Washing the dishes?

918
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,320
Yes, do the dishes.

919
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm fine today.

920
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,480
There aren't many bowls today.

921
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,360
Did you get the text?

922
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
I got a text.

923
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,040
How many?

924
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,440
Do you trust me so much?

925
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,480
How many?

926
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
One.

927
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,080
Is he on a date with you?

928
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,640
Yes.

929
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,640
Because the text we sent

930
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,000
quite...

931
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,200
ambiguous.

932
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,160
No.

933
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,080
I can tell at a glance

934
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,880
Who sent it to me?

935
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
I just talked to her.

936
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,640
She said you were the one

937
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
when you were dating.

938
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,600
So she felt very secure.

939
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
She said you brought her along.

940
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,680
I led her

941
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,880
she was a little nervous when we were dating.

942
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
I don't think she'll be nervous.

943
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,560
She will.

944
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,040
We're on a date.

945
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
She's folding the paper crane opposite me.

946
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,560
She kept folding it.

947
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
It's too much.

948
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,520
I asked her if she was nervous.

949
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,040
She said no.

950
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,240
Do you think she's cute?

951
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Yes.

952
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,440
You will start the next date

953
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,600
with her.

954
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,360
Yes.

955
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,240
Because I think I haven't finished

956
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,160
Because girls

957
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,720
I've talked a lot today.

958
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,680
I've already started.

959
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,960
My brothers are so happy today.

960
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,480
He's already setting off firecrackers in his heart.

961
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,560
Fireworks?

962
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,640
He's smiling.

963
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
The corners of his mouth keep rising today.

964
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,800
I'm in a dilemma today.

965
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm very torn today.

966
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,920
Why?

967
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,000
Because today,

968
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
After receiving that message,

969
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,360
it will say how many messages

970
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,720
have received.

971
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Then I looked at Hua.

972
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,360
Then I could feel the flowers.

973
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,560
What does that mean?

974
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,960
Why?

975
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,200
Because I think

976
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,280
I didn't send it to the map.

977
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,200
I think it's normal.

978
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,160
So you think I won't send it to Map?

979
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,680
I don't think so.

980
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,880
It's mainly about your date.

981
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,760
I had a great date today.

982
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,640
The picture is very eloquent.

983
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,640
He's also very talkative.

984
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,440
He's like a happy puppy.

985
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,680
He makes me feel like a younger brother.

986
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm not familiar with

987
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,200
with Hua these days.

988
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
I have a similar personality with Hua.

989
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,480
So I put myself

990
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,000
I put myself

991
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
like a sister.

992
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,760
Later,

993
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,280
when I asked him,

994
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,000
like this.

995
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,680
Will you like her?

996
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,280
Will you accept that?

997
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,960
I don't think

998
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,840
between me and him.

999
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,960
So do you think

1000
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,760
what you did today hurt the map?

1001
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,160
I think there might be.

1002
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,080
I'll keep thinking about it.

1003
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,480
Because if you go on a date today,

1004
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,880
you didn't receive

1005
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,400
I received so many texts,

1006
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,680
I might visit you

1007
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,640
and see your date.

1008
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
And I think a lot.

1009
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
if you think

1010
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,040
if I'm not good enough.

1011
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,480
But you won't.

1012
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Yes.

1013
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,800
If I don't receive a text

1014
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,760
after my date today,

1015
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,200
I'll...

1016
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,920
go back to my room.

1017
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,280
and cried all night.

1018
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,400
Yes.

1019
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,600
Then I thought

1020
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
if the map would say the same.

1021
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,840
He's actually very carefully prepared.

1022
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,880
But mainly,

1023
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,480
I think this is mutual.

1024
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,560
If I can feel

1025
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,840
the drawing's feelings for me,

1026
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,240
I can do it too.

1027
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,040
Can you feel it?

1028
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,640
No.

1029
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,400
If not,

1030
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,040
you don't have to worry about it.

1031
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,680
You didn't feel it.

1032
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,880
I think

1033
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,760
love can't be forced.

1034
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,080
Just get to know more about it.

1035
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,680
Even if I'm a little disappointed today,

1036
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,160
I think it's normal.

1037
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,920
This is not a problem.

1038
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,920
Because we came here

1039
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,240
to explore better people.

1040
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,160
He just advised me

1041
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,280
It's okay. Just follow your heart.

1042
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,920
You can tell him

1043
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
You can text him.

1044
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,280
But later, you need to know how you feel.

1045
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,360
It's not a problem to know first.

1046
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Who did you send it to?

1047
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,040
Who do you think I sent it to?

1048
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,480
I think Harry is the only option.

1049
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Did he send it to you?

1050
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,880
He sent it to me yesterday.

1051
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,520
What did he send?

1052
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,120
Something like having a crush on him.

1053
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:53,680
So,

1054
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,160
he probably got two today.

1055
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,760
You can't guess this.

1056
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,440
How many messages did he receive?

1057
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,560
You sent them to him.

1058
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,440
He sent you a good impression yesterday.

1059
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,520
He went on a date today.

1060
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,880
So his date today

1061
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,360
is another one.

1062
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,120
And he wants to know another one today.

1063
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
Let's get to know each other.

1064
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,680
I think it's okay.

1065
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,120
I think because we just moved in,

1066
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,920
to get to know everyone.

1067
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,320
And then...

1068
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,200
He went on a date today.

1069
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,080
He didn't talk after the date.

1070
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,080
We get to know each other slowly.

1071
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,600
I think it's a matter of order.

1072
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,560
right?

1073
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,880
But I need to be firm

1074
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,520
to like.

1075
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,680
It's still early.

1076
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
Yes, I know.

1077
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,280
I'm a person

1078
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,280
I'm not worried

1079
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,520
I'm not worried.

1080
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,360
I think we should at least

1081
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,560
until the end.

1082
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,520
I think...

1083
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,600
Let's stop talking.

1084
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,320
Okay.

1085
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:02,960
Let's go.

1086
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,520
I suddenly feel

1087
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,520
he was relaxed to see all this.

1088
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,960
He solved most of

1089
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,680
in my heart.

1090
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,400
After talking to him,

1091
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,720
after talking to him.

1092
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,200
You took over the house of siblings.

1093
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,200
You took it, right?

1094
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,480
You're going too?

1095
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,240
I wanted to.

1096
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,720
I brought you some medicine upstairs.

1097
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,000
What medicine?

1098
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,720
It's at your bedside.

1099
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,600
You'll see it when you get there.

1100
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,760
Do you want some melatonin?

1101
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:29,920
Yes.

1102
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,080
I'll wait for you to come back.

1103
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,200
Okay, wait for me, okay?

1104
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,640
Okay.

1105
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:51,680
Come on.

1106
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,400
Two.

1107
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,160
Thank you so much.

1108
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,640
Did you have a good date today?

1109
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,280
Come in and talk.

1110
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,760
Okay.

1111
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,080
Wait, I need to talk.

1112
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,920
How was your date today?

1113
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,200
It's my first date today.

1114
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,160
But I'm happy.

1115
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,240
If this weekend

1116
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,800
let you choose a girl,

1117
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,160
would you still choose her?

1118
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,960
or someone else?

1119
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,600
I have to know everything.

1120
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,160
Can't you?

1121
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,840
Wait. No.

1122
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,240
You won't.

1123
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,000
Are you sure that

1124
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,920
to the end?

1125
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,480
If you know one,

1126
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,000
you won't understand the next one?

1127
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,240
I don't know her by dating.

1128
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,840
I can understand her

1129
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,920
I can understand her.

1130
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,480
No.

1131
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,720
Dating is very attractive.

1132
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,240
Because today,

1133
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,440
I saw a different person.

1134
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,880
Really?

1135
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,360
Yes.

1136
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,120
But Xiaoling and I

1137
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,920
a very good friend today.

1138
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,320
There's nothing

1139
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,560
Love

1140
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,680
It's true.

1141
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,600
I'll write my diary.

1142
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,240
I'll write my diary.

1143
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,040
When this party is organized,

1144
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,920
there's no purpose.

1145
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
We talk about every day.

1146
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,840
When I knew that

1147
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,640
after his date today,

1148
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,520
after the date today.

1149
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
I was happy.

1150
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,520
When did you...

1151
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,800
When did you bring me cold medicine?

1152
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,080
After that,

1153
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,400
I went to get it.

1154
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,280
Come in.

1155
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,040
Present the medicine.

1156
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,520
Ten.

1157
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,520
Three packets for Xinxin.

1158
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,480
Didn't she catch a cold?

1159
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,440
Do you want some?

1160
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,160
I'll give you one.

1161
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,080
Thank you.

1162
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,560
Bye.

1163
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,480
Thank you.

1164
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,000
I'll give you medicine.

1165
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,240
One pack of cold medicine for each.

1166
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,440
Drink it today

1167
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,800
Drink it when you catch a cold.

1168
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,120
Thank you. You're so sweet.

1169
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,400
You're welcome.

1170
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,280
No.

1171
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,200
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1172
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,240
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

1173
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,200
Ten, twelve.

1174
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,120
12 packets.

1175
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Come in.

1176
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,840
I found that there are twelve packs. I'll give you two more.

1177
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,240
It's hilarious.

1178
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,960
I'll give you two more.

1179
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,600
Okay.

1180
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,000
You're a good person.

1181
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,120
But you gave me five packets.

1182
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,560
One for each.

1183
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Here's the thing.

1184
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,320
I left a pack for myself.

1185
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,280
I left a bag for soup.

1186
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,200
So you got two today, right?

1187
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,160
Are you happy?

1188
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,560
Didn't you see that I was afraid to look at my phone?

1189
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,320
Guolifang.

1190
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,000
Why?

1191
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,120
Guoli.

1192
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,520
I thought about it.

1193
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,080
I thought about it before.

1194
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,480
Because I'm very consuming.

1195
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,320
I'm afraid that if there's a misunderstanding,

1196
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,160
or two, I'm afraid it's about your choice.

1197
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,280
But I think

1198
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,920
you texted me fast.

1199
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,880
I don't have to think today.

1200
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,360
Well,

1201
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,080
Maybe I thought too much.

1202
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,360
I'm going on a date with Xiaoling today

1203
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,720
It's just...

1204
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,640
friends.

1205
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,440
You don't have to tell me.

1206
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,000
It's fun anyway.

1207
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,280
Guoli.

1208
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,800
But I think

1209
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,520
I want to know more about everyone's personality.

1210
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,640
“Guoli”.

1211
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,880
But I still think

1212
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,320
I think I know more

1213
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,920
I know more.

1214
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,720
When it's alone,

1215
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,080
Unless you like someone

1216
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,440
or someone you like,

1217
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,520
to know more.

1218
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,040
But I don't know much

1219
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,280
I don't know much.

1220
00:51:59,640 --> 00:51:59,960
Guolifang.

1221
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,800
I really want to know a question.

1222
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,360
If you have someone

1223
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,520
in the room,

1224
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,480
It's a fruit cube.

1225
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,880
You chose it

1226
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,240
because you're here.

1227
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,760
Or

1228
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,600
whether in reality,

1229
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,560
in reality,

1230
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,080
You will choose too.

1231
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,920
Of course. We can't be so hasty.

1232
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,000
It must be

1233
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,680
if I don't go on this show,

1234
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,720
if I meet my friends in real life,

1235
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,080
70 to 80,

1236
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,560
I also think this girl is good.

1237
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,600
And I chose her.

1238
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,680
Yes.

1239
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,880
But here,

1240
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,000
we might spend time together

1241
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,880
and more interactions

1242
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,200
more quickly.

1243
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,680
Yes, the advantages and disadvantages will be amplified.

1244
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,840
Yes, but

1245
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,040
Because there are

1246
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,560
We don't spend much time together.

1247
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,320
We didn't get along today.

1248
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,560
Including you, Hua,

1249
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,240
including Susu.

1250
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,680
You're good at talking.

1251
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,080
I think the core meaning of his sentence

1252
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,360
is

1253
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,320
Come on, keep sending it to me.

1254
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,160
Send it to me tomorrow.

1255
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,960
Send it to me the day after tomorrow.

1256
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,240
I'm still here.

1257
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,440
Let's talk later.

1258
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,800
Wait.

1259
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,120
Come on.

1260
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,040
What are you talking about?

1261
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,680
I have a lot to tell you.

1262
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,440
But we don't have that.

1263
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,200
To be honest,

1264
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,840
I don't really want to write a diary.

1265
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,280
I want to ask if there's anyone you want to know more.

1266
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,640
I want everyone to know the truth.

1267
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,320
Who else do you want to know?

1268
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,560
I know about girls.

1269
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,160
I want to know more about boys.

1270
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,560
I think

1271
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,680
Harry received the most today.

1272
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,600
So, Harry, have you made any progress?

1273
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,080
You're so gossipy.

1274
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,200
He's done.

1275
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

1276
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,040
Do you think you took a step forward?

1277
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,560
Anyway, I did.

1278
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,960
We were talking about today.

1279
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,880
We took a step of friendship today.

1280
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,400
I see.

1281
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,680
I got it.

1282
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,720
I haven't been in contact with him before,

1283
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,560
So I asked him directly.

1284
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,520
The feedback I got

1285
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,200
maybe he and Xinxin will be more connected.

1286
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,800
He said he took a step yesterday.

1287
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,320
I might not be able to

1288
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,960
Harry, I want to try again.

1289
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,920
Sometimes, when you say you like someone,

1290
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,200
is not necessarily about love.

1291
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,640
Maybe it's about friendship.

1292
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,240
Yes.

1293
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,520
So the definition of this text message

1294
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,080
is not necessarily right.

1295
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,640
So what I received was friendship?

1296
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,760
Because text doesn't count.

1297
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,120
To be honest, I'm more proactive than you.

1298
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,360
I'm a person who I'll try my best

1299
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,960
I will try my best.

1300
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,040
But don't you think three days are too fast?

1301
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,680
I think three days are a bit fast.

1302
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,520
Then I can't...

1303
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,920
Dude.

1304
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,720
I can't understand her a little bit today.

1305
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,640
Then tomorrow I'll get to know

1306
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,520
another little bit.

1307
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,080
I'll come back the day after tomorrow to understand her a little bit.

1308
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,560
Why not?

1309
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,600
You advised me to

1310
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,120
to get to know everyone first.

1311
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,680
Then...

1312
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,240
Yeah, I think you should...

1313
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,320
I'm just alone.

1314
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,080
I think I will be like this.

1315
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,280
So you think

1316
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,560
I'm too...

1317
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,480
because I want to lock you up too much?

1318
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,720
I don't want to lock it.

1319
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,520
I just don't think

1320
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,800
It's just a little flashy.

1321
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,760
I think three days are more secondary.

1322
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,720
I haven't shown it yet.

1323
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,560
I want to know what others mean.

1324
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,600
Is that what it means?

1325
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,320
In your feeling.

1326
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,160
Yes.

1327
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,720
Not really.

1328
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,720
I think you might get an A on your first day.

1329
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,280
The next day and the third day, maybe B.

1330
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,880
So I think you can do CD

1331
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,480
Not necessarily DC

1332
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,800
How do you know my first day is A?

1333
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,840
The next day is B.

1334
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,920
How come you don't know I'm B every three days?

1335
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,560
I'll try my best to understand.

1336
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,360
But my personal opinion is

1337
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,440
I won't say I know one today

1338
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,920
and get to know the other one tomorrow.

1339
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,920
I might

1340
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,600
spend two or three days to get to know one first.

1341
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,160
Actually, I wanted to remind him.

1342
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,280
But I can't tell him directly.

1343
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,120
Do you want to know more about me

1344
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,680
and be nice to me?

1345
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,400
Because

1346
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,840
I think we just got along.

1347
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,960
for such a short time.

1348
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,920
in such a short time.

1349
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,360
to me.

1350
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,960
I might be a little scared.

1351
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,760
I want to accept

1352
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,000
your kindness to me.

1353
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,320
But I think your kindness

1354
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,040
You can treat anyone.

1355
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,960
Because it's only three days.

1356
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,240
That's why I want to go further.

1357
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,080
and observe him slowly.

1358
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,720
or wait for him to get along with others.

1359
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,240
I want to see

1360
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,080
if he's like me.

1361
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,840
What I fear the most is

1362
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,920
his outfit is the same for everyone.

1363
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,480
The idea Hua gave me is

1364
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,960
if you want to know more about others,

1365
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,840
as soon as possible.

1366
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,760
If you want to know me,

1367
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,800
please continue to understand me.

1368
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,080
and understand me.

1369
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,520
Please be more determined and continue.

1370
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,680
Don't say you know me for a few days,

1371
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,520
or after a few days.

1372
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,200
She doesn't accept it.

1373
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,440
I can feel that

1374
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,960
Are you still chatting?

1375
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,720
chatting?

1376
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,560
Let me join.

1377
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,480
Will you be moved?

1378
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,000
You'll be moved by love after a long time.

1379
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,400
Yes.

1380
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,040
I will.

1381
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,120
I don't fall in love at first sight.

1382
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,040
My love grows gradually.

1383
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,240
Love can grow as time goes by.

1384
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,200
But I think the touching love

1385
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,720
is that I love him

1386
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,160
Yes.

1387
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,800
Then I won't.

1388
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,720
Right? I won't be touched either.

1389
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,160
Yes.

1390
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,400
Not at all. Of course not.

1391
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,600
But if he likes you more,

1392
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,320
and treats you well,

1393
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,280
and you were moved.

1394
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,000
I think this possibility

1395
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,000
Yes, I think so too.

1396
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,480
Why should I let him succeed?

1397
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,160
You're the only good person.

1398
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,800
He's starting to get confused again.

1399
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
I can understand.

1400
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,640
I'm absorbing experience.

1401
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,440
Are you observing girls' thoughts?

1402
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,680
Actually, these thoughts are very normal.

1403
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,200
But I remember yesterday,

1404
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,680
Harry said he would be moved.

1405
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,760
Yes, he will.

1406
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,120
Even if you don't

1407
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,920
for this girl,

1408
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
No.

1409
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,800
I think it's OK.

1410
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,200
If you think she's okay,

1411
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,920
I'll try to get along with you.

1412
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,400
No.

1413
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,040
I don't have a place to look at this.

1414
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,520
As long as I'm sure that girls like me,

1415
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,040
I'll take the initiative.

1416
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,960
What if someone else in your WeChat

1417
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,040
suddenly pops out

1418
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,120
Delete.

1419
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Will you take the initiative to delete it?

1420
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,400
You can delete it.

1421
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,560
Awesome.

1422
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,720
You delete it when you're in a relationship.

1423
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,000
If you need it, delete it.

1424
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
When she comes to you,

1425
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,080
you said I have a girlfriend.

1426
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,920
Delete it.

1427
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,720
I deleted everything before.

1428
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,800
What was I thinking?

1429
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,600
I thought

1430
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,320
as long as I want to invite my boyfriend

1431
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,880
to do something,

1432
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,040
I have to do this first

1433
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,800
to invite my boyfriend to do this.

1434
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,840
You also ask your boyfriend to delete it.

1435
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,760
A big part. Yes.

1436
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,400
Most?

1437
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,360
Are you a control freak?

1438
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,440
I used to be a little...

1439
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,640
You've grown up.

1440
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,240
It's quite controlling.

1441
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,800
Yes.

1442
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,240
Are you a control freak?

1443
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,120
I'm fine.

1444
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,520
What about you?

1445
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,480
I'm fine.

1446
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,120
I'm the kind of person

1447
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,280
If he asks me to do something,

1448
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,880
I'll ask him to do the same thing.

1449
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,160
That's what I thought.

1450
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,120
Harry is the first person

1451
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,160
for a long time.

1452
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,440
But I think he's more like a friend.

1453
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,960
Xin and Harry.

1454
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,840
They did the dishes together yesterday.

1455
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,120
And they gave each other medicine today.

1456
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,520
So I think it's interesting.

1457
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,080
I think we all need

1458
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,440
people in the same frequency.

1459
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,560
with the same frequency.

1460
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,280
will be more synchronized.

1461
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,760
and get along better.

1462
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,040
Let's go.

1463
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,280
What do you need

1464
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,720
Cucumber bread

1465
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,880
Tomato sauce

1466
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,040
Brush a pan.

1467
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,360
There should be a pan.

1468
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,960
to cook for the first time

1469
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,160
to make up for the sandwich incident.

1470
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,600
It's a good show.

1471
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,880
Turn on the smoke engine first.

1472
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,120
Right.

1473
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,720
And the third one.

1474
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,520
So scary?

1475
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,720
Is this oil This is oil

1476
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,440
It's oil

1477
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,360
Touch it first.

1478
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,960
Pour it directly. It's quite hot.

1479
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,760
How much?

1480
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,440
Enough.

1481
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,440
How many people do you make?

1482
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,320
Two.

1483
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,040
You eat.

1484
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,920
Then you make one.

1485
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,480
There are four of us in total.

1486
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,880
Pull my roommate up.

1487
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,160
I said you were watching

1488
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,920
and guide me every step.

1489
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,120
I'll do it myself.

1490
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,640
I want to make one for Xiaoling.

1491
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,280
There's an egg shell.

1492
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,200
It's okay.

1493
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,200
Stir-fry the eggs first.

1494
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,160
Let me learn.

1495
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,120
Just take the shovel.

1496
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,440
You do it yourself.

1497
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,360
Why is it so hard to cook?

1498
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,120
How much strength do you usually use?

1499
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,240
Medium strength.

1500
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,040
Why is my egg shell falling again?

1501
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,120
It's okay.

1502
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,640
How to break it

1503
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,360
Just keep stirring it.

1504
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,240
Okay.

1505
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,400
Why is it uglier than yours?

1506
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,000
Dude.

1507
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,160
Did you fire?

1508
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1509
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,240
I thought you opened it for me.

1510
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,760
No.

1511
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,600
The more I think about it, the more I want to laugh.

1512
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,840
I haven't fired for half a day.

1513
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,800
Why are you laughing? You just learned how to fry eggs yesterday.

1514
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,920
You're a talent even if you didn't cook it for half a day.

1515
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,640
I stir-fry it.

1516
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,760
What should I put

1517
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,440
Oh-Ee needs to

1518
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,600
Do I need to wash them all

1519
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,040
You need to wash your hands.

1520
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,880
Let me do it.

1521
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,360
Rub it. Rub it in the middle.

1522
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,760
Come on, cut one first.

1523
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,640
Let me see how big each piece is.

1524
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,120
That's it.

1525
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,680
Okay.

1526
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,400
Almost this big.

1527
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,920
Okay, I'll try.

1528
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,800
What's next?

1529
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,400
Tomato.

1530
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,640
No tomatoes.

1531
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,920
I have no choice. Put more ketchup.

1532
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,640
Is it enough?

1533
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,880
Not enough.

1534
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,520
Again.

1535
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,200
Don't ask me why.

1536
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,320
Others may put less.

1537
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,160
She must put more.

1538
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,400
How do you know?

1539
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,120
I guessed.

1540
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,840
It's almost done.

1541
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,760
What should we put after the ketchup?

1542
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,080
Eggs.

1543
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,120
Be careful.

1544
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,120
This cheese is quite delicious.

1545
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,120
Susu, do you want cheese?

1546
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,440
Yes.

1547
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,120
Well, I can put some

1548
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,280
and one without.

1549
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,520
She can eat whatever she wants.

1550
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,480
A piece and a half.

1551
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,360
Like this.

1552
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,600
Let's cut it from the middle

1553
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,920
and wrap it with plastic wrap.

1554
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,960
Okay.

1555
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,080
Check it.

1556
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,560
How do you use plastic wrap for sandwiches?

1557
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,760
Okay, got it.

1558
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,600
No, bro.

1559
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,200
How many layers do you want to wrap?

1560
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,840
Are you going to keep it for tomorrow?

1561
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,000
I think it's full in teaching.

1562
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,920
Okay, I'll do it too.

1563
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,200
Or it'll be leaked.

1564
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,280
I'll do whatever it says.

1565
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,480
You're right.

1566
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,240
I'll do whatever you do.

1567
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,360
After all, nothing will go wrong following Tsinghua.

1568
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,720
Don't put a hat on me.

1569
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:37,960
No.

1570
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,400
How did you cut it with a plastic wrap?

1571
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,480
Like this.

1572
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,680
Okay.

1573
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,440
Yours is so honest. Your sandwich.

1574
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,880
My first success.

1575
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,840
Very good.

1576
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,720
Enrolled.

1577
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,040
That's all. I'll clean up later.

1578
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:56,680
I'm tired.

1579
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,320
I'm tired.

1580
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,080
Take a break for two minutes.

1581
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,600
Should I eat it?

1582
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,440
Are you crazy?

1583
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,520
I'm so hungry.

1584
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,120
Then why do we get up early?

1585
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,400
Get up early and work on our own.

1586
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,600
We're the benchmark.

1587
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,120
We have to get up early.

1588
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,000
We got up early for an hour and a half.

1589
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,040
and ate it ourselves.

1590
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,640
Yes.

1591
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,320
I'll go upstairs to the bathroom.

1592
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,200
Okay.

1593
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,080
Hello.

1594
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,040
Eat that.

1595
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,960
It's all your fault.

1596
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,520
No, that was made for someone.

1597
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,160
I'll make another one.

1598
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,400
Because Xiaoling is going out.

1599
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,400
I want to make one too.

1600
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,200
I'll make you a dumpling.

1601
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,720
I'll get one for her.

1602
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,480
Where is Xiaoling going?

1603
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,840
She went to class this morning.

1604
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,800
It's already broken.

1605
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,040
It's not finished.

1606
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Not enough. Dig another one for me.

1607
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,840
Okay.

1608
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,120
Dig one.

1609
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:16,800
Okay.

1610
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,280
I'll make another one.

1611
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,400
Because Xiaoling has a class.

1612
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,840
I thought she could eat it at school.

1613
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,560
Harry made me some avocado there.

1614
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,120
Crush it

1615
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,840
And he cooked eggs for me.

1616
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,640
Actually he made it.

1617
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,160
Do you need to wash this plate?

1618
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,400
Yes.

1619
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,600
I look so ugly.

1620
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,840
Is it too ugly?

1621
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,280
As long as it's delicious.

1622
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,400
Cut it like this.

1623
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:45,680
Yes.

1624
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,360
Do it yourself.

1625
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,760
What's wrong?

1626
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,760
It's not my fault.

1627
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,280
You can cut it well.

1628
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,440
It means you're skillful.

1629
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,680
Because I didn't cut it well just now.

1630
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,480
I think it's dry.

1631
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,760
It won't taste good.

1632
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,080
It's okay.

1633
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,000
Even if it doesn't taste good,

1634
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,440
she'll say it's delicious.

1635
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,640
Just wait to be praised.

1636
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,600
Did Xiaoling leave?

1637
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,200
Has Xiaoling left?

1638
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,440
How would I know?

1639
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,160
Go take a look.

1640
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,240
This is the breakfast I made for her.

1641
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,000
I need to make sure she's still here.

1642
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,120
I'll ask her.

1643
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:22,880
Xin made breakfast for you.

1644
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,240
Don't forget to eat.

1645
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,640
Is it too late?

1646
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,240
You finished it in five minutes.

1647
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,600
You know what?

1648
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,920
You're lucky.

1649
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,720
Lucky?

1650
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,080
Yes.

1651
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,200
Who's lucky and I'm lucky?

1652
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,319
Yes, the one who gives is happy.

1653
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,080
Right?

1654
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,840
Who are you trying to trick?

1655
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,000
When you put in effort,

1656
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
you're full of yourself.

1657
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,399
I heard someone made me breakfast.

1658
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,080
Yes.

1659
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,279
But

1660
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,240
it may not be delicious.

1661
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,279
It looks good

1662
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,920
Eat now

1663
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,120
Thank you.

1664
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,479
I want to hear the truth.

1665
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,960
Sometimes,

1666
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,120
he said it's not good.

1667
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,120
You're so annoying.

1668
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,279
Is it good?

1669
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:16,760
It smells good.

1670
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,520
Don't lie to me.

1671
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,800
I'll be sad.

1672
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,040
Try it yourself.

1673
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,000
Leave it to Hua.

1674
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,760
She finished it. Look.

1675
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,240
This is delicious.

1676
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,479
It's not bad.

1677
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,000
Are you two competing?

1678
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,720
No, I think you're too kind.

1679
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,200
Are you coming back for dinner tonight?

1680
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,120
I should be back at 6 p.m.

1681
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,960
You can eat it when you come back.

1682
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,640
Okay.

1683
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,160
Who told you that?

1684
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,200
You ran away and asked you to eat directly.

1685
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,760
Make a radish squat and eat one

1686
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,320
One radish squat and one squat.

1687
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,600
I want to sew his mouth.

1688
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,000
He's really annoying, you know?

1689
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,720
Who's annoying?

1690
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,280
Bye.

1691
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,400
Do you want to drink this coconut?

1692
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,120
I'll drink it if you don't.

1693
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,240
You drink.

1694
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,760
No.

1695
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,840
I want to know if it's in.

1696
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,080
It's not open.

1697
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,560
But I can't get in.

1698
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,280
What should I do?

1699
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,200
Can you drink it?

1700
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,600
Give it to me.

1701
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,440
Can't you just cut it?

1702
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,200
Can I drink it?

1703
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Am I swollen? My eyes are fine.

1704
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,120
I'm very swollen this morning.

1705
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,920
Do you want pumpkin juice?

1706
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,120
To reduce swelling?

1707
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:06,720
Yes.

1708
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,400
The secret to my small face every day

1709
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,160
You have to drink it secretly.

1710
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,600
Don't let others find out.

1711
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,360
I won't tell others.

1712
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,960
Because I don't have that much.

1713
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,040
Let's make a deal.

1714
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,280
You're so ugly. I'm speechless.

1715
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,480
Bro, do you know that?

1716
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,240
This is the ugliest coconut I've ever had.

1717
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,920
Do you know how difficult it is?

1718
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,040
Susu is wearing a mask.

1719
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,880
Why is there a butterfly mask?

1720
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,440
No one can look at me.

1721
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,360
Morning.

1722
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,440
Is this edible

1723
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,600
No.

1724
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,840
No.

1725
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,160
Is this mine?

1726
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,120
No.

1727
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,120
It's not mine.

1728
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,200
Your smile is mine and not mine.

1729
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,920
Why are you jumping?

1730
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,480
I'll do it myself.

1731
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,480
Dude, do it yourself.

1732
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,920
Are you down there?

1733
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,360
Yes.

1734
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,160
Who's there?

1735
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,520
Me, Fatty.

1736
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,800
Harry is doing his hair.

1737
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,760
I'm here.

1738
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,640
Hua.

1739
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,680
or Xinxin.

1740
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,040
Or...

1741
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,000
Can't you tell who it is by the sound?

1742
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,880
You can.

1743
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,160
Of course.

1744
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,320
Tell me now.

1745
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,120
Susu.

1746
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,680
I guessed wrong.

1747
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,080
It's okay.

1748
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,600
I was too gentle.

1749
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,000
I know it's me.

1750
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,920
Talk nicely.

1751
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,240
I'll speak very slowly today.

1752
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,920
What? Blood pressure?

1753
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,960
I'll start talking slowly today.

1754
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,040
Why?

1755
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,560
She bit her tongue last night.

1756
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,440
Because I'm very gentle.

1757
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,640
I'm hungry. I want to eat something.

1758
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,920
Whose is this?

1759
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,960
I left it for Hua.

1760
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,680
This should be made by Harry for Susu.

1761
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,520
Harry for Susu.

1762
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,200
No.

1763
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,120
He didn't make it?

1764
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,680
I made it for Susu.

1765
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,000
Did you really make this

1766
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,360
You cut the cucumber yourself

1767
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:48,680
Yes

1768
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,320
The other half.

1769
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,240
I don't know who changed it to corn.

1770
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,400
I don't know.

1771
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,640
Maybe later

1772
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,120
two corns later.

1773
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,880
When I first came down,

1774
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,080
half of it was gone.

1775
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,920
Hurry up, Susu.

1776
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,360
Your breakfast has turned into two corns.

1777
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,440
I can tell from the footsteps.

1778
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,160
Someone is learning from me.

1779
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,400
This...

1780
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,400
Someone is learning from someone.

1781
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,400
Love is everything.

1782
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,680
He woke up early to make sandwiches for me today.

1783
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,680
because he mentioned

1784
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,320
he said

1785
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,680
he'll go with Harry Potter tomorrow.

1786
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,680
to learn how to make sandwiches.

1787
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,480
It's good

1788
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,720
I can do what I say.

1789
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,960
I think

1790
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,400
the sandwich he made

1791
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,440
is a little better

1792
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,880
than Harry Potter.

1793
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,880
Xinxin is hungry.

1794
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,960
Xinxin is hungry.

1795
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,520
Who did you give this sandwich to?

1796
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,360
Why not?

1797
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,520
She wanted to do it with me.

1798
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,840
For Xiao Ling.

1799
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,440
Is the sandwich good?

1800
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,440
Did you eat it yourself?

1801
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,560
No.

1802
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,720
You dare not eat?

1803
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,560
I left it for Hua. I dare to eat anything.

1804
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,280
Xiao Ling said it's delicious.

1805
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,920
Xiao Ling said it's delicious.

1806
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,160
It's okay. I'll feed it now.

1807
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:33,960
You eat it.

1808
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,200
You eat.

1809
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,680
I wish I could see you eat.

1810
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,320
I've never seen him eating.

1811
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,560
I just ate some rice this morning.

1812
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,080
When did he eat anything?

1813
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,120
This morning.

1814
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,280
Have you seen it?

1815
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,200
I don't remember much.

1816
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,440
Yes, it's just vague.

1817
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,080
No.

1818
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,720
Who knows how to gain 6 kilos in eight days?

1819
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,120
You've gained 6 kilos.

1820
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,240
Why?

1821
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,480
What did you eat so delicious?

1822
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,320
Who knows?

1823
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,240
I eat and drink every day.

1824
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,640
Take a bite and it'll turn dark.

1825
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,560
You eat it.

1826
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,720
He ate the flowers.

1827
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,640
Is it good?

1828
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,280
A little salty.

1829
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,360
Is it bad?

1830
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,080
No, a little salty.

1831
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,960
Why is it salty?

1832
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,960
My taste is light.

1833
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,880
I can't. Let me have a bite.

1834
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,200
I don't believe it.

1835
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
Could it be...

1836
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:38,840
I'll eat this side.

1837
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,080
Add a sausage

1838
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,120
It's not salty

1839
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,240
It doesn't taste at all.

1840
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,320
What's wrong with you?

1841
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,720
You just want to eat what I've eaten.

1842
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,160
It's a bit salty.

1843
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,320
Hello.

1844
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,760
Hua.

1845
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,680
Hello.

1846
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,000
Ask Harry to make breakfast for you.

1847
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,360
It's okay.

1848
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,360
Harry, go.

1849
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,320
You ate someone else's food.

1850
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,440
Whom did you eat?

1851
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,400
Eat her.

1852
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,520
Go help.

1853
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,640
What are you doing?

1854
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:33,680
Nothing.

1855
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,520
I'll just drink yogurt.

1856
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,840
Hua, do you want some eggs?

1857
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,400
What?

1858
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,400
Eggs. Okay, put it there.

1859
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,040
I'll eat it.

1860
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,120
Whose breakfast is this?

1861
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,320
They all made it for Susu.

1862
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,160
Whose is this?

1863
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,000
Susu's.

1864
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,840
It's Susu's again.

1865
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,280
Come and eat your breakfast.

1866
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,160
You're so happy.

1867
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,440
This is soup for you.

1868
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,880
Harry made this for you.

1869
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,680
Eat.

1870
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,680
Do you want it?

1871
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,680
No.

1872
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,000
It's not for me. I don't want it.

1873
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,880
I can't eat it.

1874
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,440
I ate half of it.

1875
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,080
Don't waste it.

1876
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,320
I think girls like favourite.

1877
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,840
So I think

1878
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,480
a little bit disappointed.

1879
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,040
You got up so late.

1880
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,240
I got up early.

1881
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,920
I ate half of it.

1882
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,960
I thought someone took it.

1883
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,600
I ate it. I ate it upstairs.

1884
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,000
That's good.

1885
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,520
Eat up.

1886
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,560
All sandwiches.

1887
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,400
Someone's coming.

1888
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,040
Hurry!

1889
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,480
Someone is coming.

1890
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,160
Who's here?

1891
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,560
Who's here?

1892
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,280
My name is Tae-seo.

1893
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,400
I'm a model.

1894
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,240
Hello

1895
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,120
Hello.

1896
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,720
Who is it?

1897
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,120
New guest.

1898
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,880
We have a new guest.

1899
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,720
Hello.

1900
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,440
Let's go in.

1901
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,760
As soon as he came in,

1902
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,240
at a distance.

1903
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,640
Because I like tall guys.

1904
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,760
If it's his first look,

1905
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,720
I couldn't control myself.

1906
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,560
I was too excited.

1907
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,560
Have a seat.

1908
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,400
Let me introduce myself.

1909
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,600
Hello, I'm Terri.

1910
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,400
Hello, I'm Susu.

1911
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,200
Hello, Susu.

1912
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,080
Xinxin.

1913
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,920
Hua.

1914
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:23,840
Fatty.

1915
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,160
My name is Soup.

1916
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:25,960
Soup?

1917
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,640
I didn't expect a rookie to come.

1918
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,080
I had a high first impression of him.

1919
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,320
He should be a model.

1920
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,560
Because the other boys

1921
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,320
other boys may still be in school.

1922
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,520
So after he came in,

1923
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,120
his aura is different.

1924
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,440
He looks mature.

1925
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,360
and similar.

1926
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,640
who acts as a bossy president.

1927
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,160
I think Terri

1928
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,680
should be Xiao Ling's type.

1929
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,800
Handsome.

1930
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,440
Of course he's handsome.

1931
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,040
But I'm happy too.

1932
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,440
Because this boy may give my sister

1933
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,040
a better way

1934
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,000
or she has more choices.

1935
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,160
What's MBTI?

1936
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,720
ENFP.

1937
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,120
But I'm a little introverted.

1938
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,400
ENFP.

1939
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,040
Okay.

1940
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,160
I understand.

1941
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,360
There's an ENFP.

1942
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,360
He's not back yet.

1943
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,560
Aren't you also an ENFP? No.

1944
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,160
Three.

1945
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:36,520
Yes.

1946
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,480
Okay.

1947
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,200
So sudden.

1948
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,360
Harry, you're so happy.

1949
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,520
What's your smile?

1950
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,360
Can you tell me?

1951
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,080
Harry, your smile is that you're happy with a boy.

1952
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:47,920
No.

1953
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,480
We have a similar name, but...

1954
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:49,920
No.

1955
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,800
He's already looking forward to new girls.

1956
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,960
So a new friend will come today.

1957
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,480
One?

1958
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,440
Two Guoli.

1959
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,080
Two, but she can't.

1960
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,280
Together?

1961
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,080
I can't do it.

1962
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,680
I've already started calculating.

1963
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,600
So one of us

1964
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,040
one of us will come.

1965
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,920
Yes, we can have brothers.

1966
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,720
Three.

1967
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,680
Do you all know

1968
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,920
each other's occupation?

1969
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,760
Okay.

1970
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,840
Can we tell him everything?

1971
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,280
Isn't it fun not to tell him?

1972
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,080
Okay.

1973
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,200
I have a guess.

1974
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,120
Colleague.

1975
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:52,600
I'll...

1976
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,160
I think I can say it out loud.

1977
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,480
Me too.

1978
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,440
Two words.

1979
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,320
I think I know.

1980
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,240
Two words, right?

1981
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,480
MT?

1982
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,520
You said that.

1983
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,560
MIT, right?

1984
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,400
Yes.

1985
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,320
I’m MiT.

1986
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:10,720
Yes.

1987
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,160
Yes, I'm from MIT.

1988
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,600
Do you all have pets?

1989
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,160
Do you have one?

1990
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,960
I have two cats.

1991
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,520
And mine has two dogs.

1992
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,760
Yours has two.

1993
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,560
Your brother has two dogs.

1994
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,720
Yes.

1995
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,680
When are your brothers coming?

1996
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,080
Or are they already here?

1997
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,360
I can't tell you.

1998
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,520
Hurry up.

1999
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,080
Why are you so excited?

2000
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,280
You go. You are the most excited.

2001
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,720
He said something wrong. I really...

2002
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,840
No.

2003
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,080
Guess if it's a man or a woman.

2004
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,560
A girl.

2005
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,160
Three, two, one.

2006
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,520
It's a mission.

2007
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,880
Okay, it's the mission.

2008
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,120
You need a plan.

2009
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,920
The picture is not here.

2010
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:13,720
Okay.

2011
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,160
I'll read it this time.

2012
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:17,720
You read it.

2013
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,320
To the boy in the house.

2014
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,200
Welcome new members to the cottage.

2015
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,200
We prepared a

2016
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,960
for boys.

2017
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,640
Let's go to the designated location.

2018
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,480
Let's go.

2019
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,160
When I got the text that a guy went out for dinner,

2020
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,360
I was thinking,

2021
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,240
Oh no.

2022
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,280
The three boys

2023
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,840
would ask me a lot of questions.

2024
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,200
and attack me.

2025
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,760
I'm actually a little nervous.

2026
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,800
You said you wanted to eat pizza.

2027
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,360
Yes.

2028
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,560
Let's eat.

2029
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,320
Anyone wants some?

2030
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,240
This tastes like white grapes.

2031
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,480
I'll drink white grapes.

2032
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,960
My 30 degrees

2033
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,360
30 percent.

2034
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,240
That's juice content.

2035
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,880
It's my favorite peach flavor again.

2036
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,800
I'll have a low alcohol.

2037
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,800
Cheers.

2038
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,600
Cheers.

2039
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,560
What did you talk about yesterday?

2040
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,720
Let's start with the soup, okay?

2041
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,440
What did I talk about on a date?

2042
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,960
Because you're the first one among the three of us.

2043
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,600
What did you talk about?

2044
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,400
Did you choose your date by yourself?

2045
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,000
or random?

2046
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,240
Not yesterday.

2047
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,760
The girl chose the date yesterday.

2048
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,760
It's girls who choose boys.

2049
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,360
It's not girls who choose boys directly.

2050
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,840
but after the girl chooses the boy,

2051
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,720
you have to vote for his brothers.

2052
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,880
So the date yesterday

2053
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,120
was a coincidence.

2054
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,440
Yes.

2055
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,560
If a girl chooses a boy,

2056
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,960
For example, she wants to go on a date with you.

2057
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,840
But she must guess

2058
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,880
who your brother is

2059
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,920
to succeed.

2060
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,800
If you guess my brother,

2061
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,480
go on a date with me.

2062
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:23,920
Not with you.

2063
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,440
I gave you the wrong one.

2064
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,120
Really?

2065
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:28,600
What?

2066
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,880
Isn't that strange?

2067
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
When you arrived,

2068
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,600
you're not the person you want to see.

2069
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:37,720
Really?

2070
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,520
It's her, not me.

2071
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,400
Yes, the girl.

2072
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,760
Yes.

2073
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,360
I think boys

2074
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,920
will have this part.

2075
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,040
Tonight?

2076
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,680
But you already know.

2077
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:51,920
We don't know.

2078
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:52,960
But

2079
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,600
we have a guess.

2080
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,960
But we don't know.

2081
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,960
We know more than I do.

2082
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,000
Tell me.

2083
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,720
You came in today and saw this.

2084
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,400
The two you think are the most alike

2085
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,520
Harry and him.

2086
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,880
The girl on the right.

2087
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,320
Harry and the girl on his right.

2088
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,440
That's Harry and Xinxin, right?

2089
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:22,440
Okay.

2090
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,040
It's okay.

2091
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:26,720
You guessed right.

2092
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,950
Amazing, right?

2093
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:30,270
Right?

2094
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,440
That's amazing.

2095
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,640
Very confident.

2096
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,230
Because

2097
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,510
you two have more interactions.

2098
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,480
Yes.

2099
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,990
Yes, she should be the elder sister.

2100
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:47,360
It feels like talking to you

2101
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:47,870
Yes.

2102
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,310
Very overwhelming.

2103
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:51,600
Yes, it feels like a sister

2104
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,080
to her younger brother.

2105
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,680
Yes.

2106
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,800
The two most alike

2107
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,830
are not inside.

2108
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:01,920
He and his brothers...

2109
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,520
Right?

2110
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,880
No, she's here today.

2111
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,510
I don't believe it.

2112
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,870
His brothers are here today.

2113
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:12,920
Really.

2114
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:14,720
I don't believe you. He's definitely not here.

2115
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,080
Is your brother here today?

2116
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:20,320
Guess.

2117
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,200
She must be here.

2118
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,390
Do you think she'll come today?

2119
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,430
Is it possible that she's already here?

2120
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,430
Impossible.

2121
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:31,710
Why?

2122
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,110
No reason.

2123
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,240
I can only say that I'm good at acting.

2124
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,390
It's possible, really. I majored in acting.

2125
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,560
Yes.

2126
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,400
I learned acting.

2127
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,190
This boys' chatting house

2128
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,480
shouldn't talk about

2129
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,830
but about the opposite sex.

2130
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:53,560
Yes.

2131
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,750
Is there anyone you like?

2132
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,470
Who do you like?

2133
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,670
I haven't touched

2134
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,920
Just say the first sight.

2135
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,800
We're not all here.

2136
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,510
It's hard to say.

2137
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:17,520
Let's talk about the three here first.

2138
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,680
Kind of.

2139
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,640
Because I

2140
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,000
I think

2141
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,760
I don't think we've got enough contact.

2142
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,720
Because I think all three girls are good.

2143
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,520
Yeah.

2144
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,760
Let's ask what type do you like?

2145
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,160
I like people who get along well.

2146
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,680
We may have more common topics.

2147
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:51,760
But appearance doesn't matter.

2148
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,480
Not very important.

2149
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,840
Personality is more important.

2150
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,640
All important.

2151
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,910
I'm sure they all look good in our house.

2152
01:31:58,910 --> 01:31:59,320
Yes.

2153
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,720
You can also ask us a question.

2154
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,120
Let me think.

2155
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,600
After all, you've lived

2156
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,270
for three or four days.

2157
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,560
Did you have a date?

2158
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,280
Yes.

2159
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:14,750
Just get in touch.

2160
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,830
Are you interested in it?

2161
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:17,400
Yes.

2162
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,190
All of them?

2163
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:22,590
Some people still haven't arrived.

2164
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,320
Both.

2165
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,280
You too.

2166
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:29,470
Someone's here.

2167
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,320
What are you doing?

2168
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,320
Someone is there.

2169
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:35,200
He's the most obvious.

2170
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,840
Really?

2171
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:39,550
Really? I didn't feel it.

2172
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,240
You didn't feel it?

2173
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:44,510
If you feel it, something will happen.

2174
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:46,880
Your siblings.

2175
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:51,160
Soup is interested in your brothers.

2176
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,760
If you guess it like that, he's my brother.

2177
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,000
For example, Soup likes your brothers.

2178
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,910
How do you feel?

2179
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,440
You will...

2180
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,070
If Soup likes my brother,

2181
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:09,760
I'll pay more attention to the soup.

2182
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,000
Normally.

2183
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,080
What do you think of him?

2184
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,120
Yes.

2185
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,480
Where's the soup?

2186
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,430
It depends on

2187
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:19,390
if he can play ping-pong.

2188
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:21,720
Can I play with you?

2189
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,880
Can I beat you?

2190
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,600
Maybe it depends on his sincerity

2191
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,040
or his character.

2192
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,200
The rest may be behind.

2193
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,480
It depends on his character first.

2194
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,520
I think we're all the same.

2195
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,280
I'm not.

2196
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,440
Aren't you?

2197
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,520
Then answer me.

2198
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,680
I'll see if he's pretending or not.

2199
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,240
If he is,

2200
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,600
no matter how good he is,

2201
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,670
he may not be able to tell.

2202
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:46,200
He's just pretending.

2203
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,240
What if your brother loves him very much?

2204
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:48,880
No.

2205
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,280
Then you will...

2206
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,200
Tell your brothers

2207
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,520
if you want to be with him,

2208
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,040
I won't help you.

2209
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,600
Yes, will you stop it?

2210
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,000
I won't.

2211
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,070
I think

2212
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,040
if I had found out,

2213
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,960
it wouldn't have happened.

2214
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,080
made my brothers like him very much.

2215
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,320
You will get involved.

2216
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,510
I will.

2217
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,760
You would tell her a lot about this man.

2218
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,000
that he's not good.

2219
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,480
If he's really bad, he'll...

2220
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,070
What about you?

2221
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:24,440
I should be like you two.

2222
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,920
I know how to observe.

2223
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,480
Yes, I won't say it.

2224
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,200
I'll deny someone

2225
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,200
by some trivial things.

2226
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,120
I may have a long period of time.

2227
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,640
If you go out

2228
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,240
with a girl,

2229
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,080
what would you do with her?

2230
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,560
Good question.

2231
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,990
I don't think I'll take her.

2232
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:47,120
I'm good at it.

2233
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,190
I want to take her

2234
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:49,360
something I want to try.

2235
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,160
For example, skiing.

2236
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,720
But I've never skied.

2237
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,200
Neither have I.

2238
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:55,920
You don't either?

2239
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,510
Do you want to try?

2240
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:57,520
I want to try.

2241
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,200
Can you take me there?

2242
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,350
The three of us.

2243
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:00,880
Like this.

2244
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,680
OK?

2245
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,480
Okay.

2246
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:04,160
What about you, Fatty?

2247
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,800
What do you think

2248
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,920
with a girl?

2249
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,790
what would you think?

2250
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,800
I might feel relaxed

2251
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,190
and choose a nice cafe

2252
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:18,000
and have a chat.

2253
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,960
Will you take her to race?

2254
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:20,400
No.

2255
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,320
Because I think the first date

2256
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,070
is mainly

2257
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:24,510
to get to know each other.

2258
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,480
Maybe we should communicate.

2259
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,360
I agree.

2260
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,800
I will take her to a hotel.

2261
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,470
I guess...

2262
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:30,910
Yes, let's eat and have afternoon tea.

2263
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:32,120
and watch a movie.

2264
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:32,640
Let's have afternoon tea.

2265
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,840
I think afternoon tea is a good choice.

2266
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:45,440
Show us.

2267
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,000
I think different situations

2268
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,840
different situations.

2269
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,960
For example, in the small house,

2270
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:56,120
our personal information is relatively confidential,

2271
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,110
We don't know

2272
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:00,120
each other's growth experience.

2273
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,560
At this time,

2274
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,240
I might choose to take her

2275
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,870
where I grew up.

2276
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:10,360
or what I've done the most,

2277
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,160
I want her to know more about me.

2278
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,560
If it was in the small house,

2279
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,160
I would be like this.

2280
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,440
But if it's outside,

2281
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,560
I'm usually socialising.

2282
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,120
At this time,

2283
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,080
maybe we should go somewhere for dinner

2284
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,920
or go to the park.

2285
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,510
My name is Tata.

2286
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,160
I'm a full-time model.

2287
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:59,600
Hello.

2288
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,040
Hello

2289
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,430
What's your name?

2290
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:07,960
My name is Fatty.

2291
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,240
Fatty. OK.

2292
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,750
You can call me Tata.

2293
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:11,710
Tata.

2294
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:13,080
A lighthouse.

2295
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,080
Okay.

2296
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,870
I saw a pretty girl at first sight.

2297
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:25,630
smiling at me.

2298
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:27,710
So my mind went blank.

2299
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,310
I didn't know what to do.

2300
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:32,720
I don't know why he chose me.

2301
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,750
I was caught off guard today.

2302
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:36,510
I was really nervous.

2303
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:39,870
So you

2304
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,840
at the same time?

2305
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:42,590
No.

2306
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,440
You're my first guest.

2307
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,600
It's an honor.

2308
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,920
Yes.

2309
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,080
Did you see the photo or

2310
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,400
Yes.

2311
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,840
Your childhood photo

2312
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:55,120
I picked RICHMJRYD when I was young

2313
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,670
I picked it when I was young

2314
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,760
Yes.

2315
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,400
Okay.

2316
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,830
I decided to see this first.

2317
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,880
Your childhood photo.

2318
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,560
This photo

2319
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,560
smiling brightly.

2320
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,080
I think you're a cheerful person.

2321
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:44,670
Really?

2322
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,040
It's an honor. Yes.

2323
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,800
Take a look again.

2324
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,280
But I can see that you're a little fat.

2325
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,760
So cute.

2326
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,080
I didn't expect

2327
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,800
I would meet the first male guest

2328
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,680
to meet the first female guest.

2329
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,760
It means when I was a baby,

2330
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,150
I was far ahead.

2331
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:15,960
The back is crooked.

2332
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,840
I'm honored

2333
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,600
as the first person I met.

2334
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:24,160
How about a toast?

2335
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:34,160
So you've been here for four days.

2336
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,480
Yes.

2337
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,470
How is it? In the small house.

2338
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,320
I think everyone gets along well.

2339
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,840
Are you familiar with each other?

2340
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,550
Yes, we are.

2341
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,720
And we have brothers.

2342
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,920
So we got into that state quickly.

2343
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,400
And everyone is relaxed.

2344
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,000
So tonight,

2345
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,190
for the first time.

2346
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:54,480
I might feel awkward.

2347
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,160
I'm an introvert.

2348
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:56,800
You are an introvert.

2349
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,320
I need you to guide me.

2350
01:39:59,320 --> 01:39:59,870
OK.

2351
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,680
Our current situation

2352
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:04,160
Boys and girls E and I

2353
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:04,880
and I.

2354
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:08,600
I think girls have good personalities.

2355
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,110
That's good.

2356
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,640
What do you do?

2357
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,550
I start my own business.

2358
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:16,830
RIC HM

2359
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,360
I'm a full-time model.

2360
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,040
You're a full-time model.

2361
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,920
We have a full-time model today.

2362
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,600
Really?

2363
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,480
What a coincidence.

2364
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,080
Maybe earlier than you.

2365
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,800
A little earlier.

2366
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,030
Today?

2367
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:35,760
Tata is a model

2368
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,840
Terri looks very elegant too.

2369
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,510
They have the same occupation.

2370
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:42,270
I think they are siblings.

2371
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,880
Can I ask you a question?

2372
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,350
Because I think you are slimmer.

2373
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:51,280
So do you have any requirements

2374
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,240
your ideal type?

2375
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,240
No.

2376
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:55,070
No.

2377
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,480
It depends on the eye.

2378
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,440
My eyes are round.

2379
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,840
Fatty gives me the feeling.

2380
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,510
Just as I expected.

2381
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:06,910
He's a cheerful guy.

2382
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:08,720
He can liven up the atmosphere.

2383
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,640
I'll have some more cake.

2384
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,120
Our food is good today.

2385
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,520
Did anyone cook during the day?

2386
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:18,800
Yes.

2387
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:19,070
Yes.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

2388
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,400
Are you cooking?

2389
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,240
What do you think, Rich?

2390
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,200
I think you can cook.

2391
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:23,710
Feels like RICHM

2392
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:24,350
Feeling

2393
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:24,880
Really

2394
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:25,150
No JOHN

2395
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,310
I didn't feed myself

2396
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:30,800
with my own hands.

2397
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,870
Whose hands

2398
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:33,520
Delivery.

2399
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,560
But I ordered too much food.

2400
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,080
I don't know what to eat.

2401
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,400
I have a lot of delicious food there.

2402
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,600
Is it spicy?

2403
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,800
No.

2404
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,000
Make it light.

2405
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,600
I'm going to eat a bit hard.

2406
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,590
You'll eat a lot.

2407
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:49,040
It's a bit spicy.

2408
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:53,280
Then you and your brother have different taste.

2409
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,550
How do you know who my brother is?

2410
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,680
I can infer

2411
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,160
based on this news.

2412
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,720
Because I like to guess.

2413
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,800
I won't tell you.

2414
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,400
Okay.

2415
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,080
I'll slowly discover

2416
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,200
Do you have any romantic lines

2417
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,640
Is there someone you like?

2418
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,870
Or someone you like?

2419
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,360
Yes.

2420
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:22,080
At present,

2421
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,760
we are still getting to know each other.

2422
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,270
It's okay. You came just in time.

2423
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:27,440
What do you mean?

2424
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,360
Everyone is getting to know the stage.

2425
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,480
But no one came so early.

2426
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,870
You can take a look at the rest.

2427
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,880
some boys.

2428
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,280
Does this photo look like me when I was young?

2429
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,040
Yes.

2430
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,520
Really?

2431
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,000
I need to reply.

2432
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,280
I think it looks like me too.

2433
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,160
Pretty cute.

2434
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,800
Pretty cute.

2435
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,320
You're the only

2436
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,480
with a big smile.

2437
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,880
Okay, I'll get going.

2438
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,430
See you later.

2439
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:18,880
Okay.

2440
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,760
Bye.

2441
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,040
I didn't choose to extend my weight.

2442
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:25,630
That's because

2443
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:27,480
he was the first guy I met.

2444
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,560
Just keep it.

2445
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,230
I want to leave the chance to the boys behind.

2446
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:33,200
and see what's going on.

2447
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,000
Tata gives me

2448
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,560
a Japanese girl.

2449
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,040
A very elegant girl.

2450
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,200
After all, the house has been here for four days.

2451
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,400
Three or four days, right?

2452
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,000
Do you have any good suggestions?

2453
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,150
Good advice?

2454
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,280
For girls,

2455
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,560
It depends on who you like.

2456
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,080
If you like someone,

2457
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,160
I can't give you advice.

2458
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,280
What if

2459
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,080
in your situation,

2460
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:00,600
she might want to go on a date with you,

2461
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,760
but she chose me.

2462
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,720
Should I

2463
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,190
know how to get along with her?

2464
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,520
If you like someone,

2465
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,590
or someone you like.

2466
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,320
Look at me.

2467
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,440
I can see that

2468
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,520
that my roommate and I like.

2469
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:11,800
I'll ignore them.

2470
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,830
But when I see someone,

2471
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,950
I'll give you an idea.

2472
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:17,560
Or see your siblings?

2473
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,320
It doesn't matter to see my brothers.

2474
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,280
I can give you some advice.

2475
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:19,960
Okay.

2476
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,280
That's enough.

2477
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:23,870
What did you do

2478
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:26,750
what did you do in the house?

2479
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,120
What's the most important thing?

2480
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,560
Every night at 10 p.m.,

2481
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,760
send a message to those who like you.

2482
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,040
Yes.

2483
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:34,880
Then your brothers

2484
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,480
will know how many texts you received.

2485
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,200
Thank you. This message is very important.

2486
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,990
Where's Fatty?

2487
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:46,000
Bathroom.

2488
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,120
It's a little far.

2489
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,720
A little long.

2490
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,720
I'm home.

2491
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,880
Did I miss something?

2492
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,320
A lot of things.

2493
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,080
Look at his face.

2494
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,840
You'll know how hot the conversation is.

2495
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,830
You know what?

2496
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:01,760
Why am I the only one left?

2497
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,360
Did you guys speed up?

2498
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,720
Did I miss that much?

2499
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,560
A lot.

2500
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,040
So

2501
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,120
guess who my brother is?

2502
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,200
I don't think your brother is here.

2503
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,760
Your brothers are not here.

2504
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,040
Maybe she's here.

2505
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,990
I don't believe she's here.

2506
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:17,880
Shall we make a bet?

2507
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,590
A bet?

2508
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:20,160
A bottle of fruit cubes.

2509
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,840
Ten bottles. One bottle is too little.

2510
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:23,440
That's right.

2511
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,680
What do you mean?

2512
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,520
A bottle and a half.

2513
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,790
No, we have so many days

2514
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:30,200
right?

2515
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:30,960
This thing...

2516
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:42,110
I'll apply for it.

2517
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:43,160
Can I go to the bathroom?

2518
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,960
Sure.

2519
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,760
I just went there.

2520
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:47,800
You guys talk first.

2521
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,600
Don't feel awkward.

2522
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,320
Don't miss me too much, okay?

2523
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,310
The bathroom is over there.

2524
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:54,080
Outside, right?

2525
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:54,680
Put on some clothes.

2526
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,560
The bathroom is over there.

2527
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,040
Okay.

2528
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:58,840
Don't miss me too much, okay?

2529
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,840
Okay.

2530
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:16,880
Hello.

2531
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,630
Isn't it here?

2532
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,040
It's here

2533
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,280
It's here Hello

2534
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:21,790
It's here

2535
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,280
There's a new face

2536
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,440
There's food.

2537
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,560
I'll take off my clothes.

2538
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,110
You're not full?

2539
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:30,680
No.

2540
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,070
I'm not full.

2541
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,000
I ate the most.

2542
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,520
I ate five or six pizzas.

2543
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,070
Okay, you can continue.

2544
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:35,870
I can't.

2545
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:36,670
Look at my stomach.

2546
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,870
I haven't eaten yet.

2547
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:40,440
If you told me earlier,

2548
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,240
I would have brought you the pizza.

2549
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,710
I didn't know you were eating.

2550
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:44,800
I'll eat it later.

2551
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,840
It's all gone.

2552
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,320
No.

2553
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,200
I ate it all.

2554
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,960
Let's eat.

2555
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,510
It's okay.

2556
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:53,150
I'm not hungry.

2557
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,320
What's your name?

2558
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,390
I'm Harry.

2559
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,030
Harry.

2560
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:00,190
Yes.

2561
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:01,470
Okay, you can call me Tata.

2562
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:02,000
Okay.

2563
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,550
Do you mind if I stretch my stomach out?

2564
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,440
I'm really a little full.

2565
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,680
No problem.

2566
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,440
When Harry came in,

2567
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,720
he gave me

2568
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,270
he was actually relaxed.

2569
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,360
When he came in and sat down,

2570
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,120
and started to take off his clothes.

2571
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,910
He kept saying he was stuffed.

2572
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:22,750
I think he's a little funny.

2573
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,510
I don't mind if you eat more.

2574
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,560
It's okay.

2575
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,920
It's okay. Give me some noodles.

2576
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,080
Yes.

2577
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,520
Can you cook?

2578
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,200
I can cook.

2579
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:34,720
You can cook?

2580
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,120
Yes.

2581
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,320
What will you cook?

2582
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,560
What do you want to eat?

2583
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,160
What do you like to eat?

2584
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,920
Spicy food.

2585
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:42,560
Spicy.

2586
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,760
Oh no, you don't know how to cook.

2587
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,230
You can learn.

2588
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:48,720
Okay.

2589
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,320
Actually, I'm not good at it.

2590
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,480
I learned it step by step.

2591
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,430
I can cook everything my brothers like.

2592
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:55,480
But

2593
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,150
I learned it for her.

2594
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:57,760
Not really.

2595
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,440
It's mainly to make a living abroad.

2596
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,360
to make a living abroad.

2597
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,520
It's really a foreign student who cooks

2598
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,920
Foreign students fool students.

2599
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,320
I'm in London.

2600
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:10,080
I can't order any Chinese food at home.

2601
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,280
I can only learn to cook by myself.

2602
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,880
The Chinese food there may not be authentic

2603
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,160
It's definitely not authentic here anyway.

2604
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,320
Your accent is...

2605
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,280
Guess where I am from.

2606
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,840
No, I have the answer in my heart.

2607
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,280
You have the answer?

2608
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,680
Okay, let me know when you have a chance.

2609
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,680
Do your brothers have accent?

2610
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,920
No.

2611
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,960
I can only tell you that my brothers

2612
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,390
are not very similar to me.

2613
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:37,240
It's not easy for me to guess.

2614
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,400
Not easy.

2615
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,280
It's not easy according to normal logic.

2616
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,400
It's not easy for others.

2617
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,040
You already guessed what you think.

2618
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,560
I've basically guessed it.

2619
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,280
Tell me something.

2620
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,960
I haven't seen them now.

2621
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,120
or anyone.

2622
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,470
I'll be the first one.

2623
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:54,430
It's an honor.

2624
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:55,120
Seriously.

2625
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,480
I have a photo of you when you were young.

2626
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,680
Why?

2627
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:02,720
You have my childhood photo?

2628
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,640
Yes.

2629
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,240
Aren't you curious?

2630
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:06,800
Wait.

2631
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,320
Sort it out.

2632
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,760
Wait, I'm a little nervous now.

2633
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,920
I was chosen

2634
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,440
chosen me

2635
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,150
and chose this meeting.

2636
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,600
Okay, got it.

2637
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,510
I chose this meeting.

2638
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,640
Just looking at me

2639
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:30,750
I see. It's okay.

2640
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,560
You're so clumsy.

2641
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,920
Do you know which one it is?

2642
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,550
No.

2643
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:36,280
Here.

2644
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,400
Wait.

2645
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,080
What? You don't dare to look?

2646
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,160
I'm afraid it's too ugly.

2647
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,280
Just break it for me.

2648
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,840
It's not ugly. It's cute.

2649
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,200
Okay, let me see.

2650
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,310
This one.

2651
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:51,120
Wait.

2652
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,630
Did you choose me because of this photo?

2653
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:55,320
So cute.

2654
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:56,990
I thought it was just

2655
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:58,750
I was assigned.

2656
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,560
You can also say that.

2657
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,080
Yes.

2658
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,880
You're now roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll.

2659
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:02,400
Me, right?

2660
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,680
No.

2661
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,960
Okay, here's the regular question room.

2662
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,280
Okay.

2663
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:12,120
Hobbies.

2664
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:15,160
Hobbies, taking pictures, watching movies,

2665
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,080
Playing badminton.

2666
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,120
Really? I play badminton.

2667
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,270
But I'm not good at it.

2668
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:19,230
but I love playing.

2669
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:19,840
Speaking of which,

2670
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
I just bought a badminton net today.

2671
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,070
Really?

2672
01:50:23,070 --> 01:50:23,960
I bought a ping pong table

2673
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,120
and a badminton net.

2674
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,400
Good.

2675
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,760
Do you have any other hobbies?

2676
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,680
No, about the movie.

2677
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:32,190
Movie, suspense.

2678
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,520
Wait.

2679
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,840
I like suspense movie too.

2680
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,150
What's your favorite movie?

2681
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,440
The Unseen Guest.

2682
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,870
Wait, I haven't seen it yet.

2683
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:44,640
"fatal ID".

2684
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:45,790
I've watched "fatal ID".

2685
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:46,910
This is OK too.

2686
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:48,160
I seldom watch those.

2687
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,720
It's like listening to songs.

2688
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,640
I never remember the name.

2689
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:52,160
I can't remember either.

2690
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,640
I only remember its melody and its

2691
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:55,440
Just listen and listen.

2692
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,510
Yes.

2693
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:58,430
And you can hum.

2694
01:50:58,430 --> 01:50:59,600
Yes.

2695
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,240
Work news.

2696
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:22,080
Where were you?

2697
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,440
Excuse me.

2698
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,880
We talked about the movie

2699
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:29,790
after the movie.

2700
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:30,910
Can you sing?

2701
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:32,480
I think I can do it.

2702
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,040
Not bad.

2703
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:33,880
But my family said I can't sing well.

2704
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:35,870
I get along well.

2705
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,440
Because when I was chatting with him,

2706
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,480
the atmosphere is more harmonious.

2707
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,480
Because he'll take the initiative to talk.

2708
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,670
It makes me more relaxed.

2709
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:46,270
So at this moment,

2710
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:49,840
to extend the chat time.

2711
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:51,800
Yes.

2712
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,760
We actually have a segment.

2713
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,680
Every time we enter the house,

2714
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,350
I ask what MBTI is.

2715
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,160
I'm ISFJ.

2716
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,240
Then I'm "little old man".

2717
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,310
"Little old man".

2718
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,800
INFJ.

2719
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:04,120
Yes.

2720
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,150
You're not introverted at all.

2721
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:06,910
Because when I feel awkward,

2722
01:52:06,910 --> 01:52:08,670
I want to talk.

2723
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:10,320
When you feel awkward,

2724
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,030
It's awkward to talk to me.

2725
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:14,000
No, it's just self-embarrassment.

2726
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,480
On the first day,

2727
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,400
when I entered that room,

2728
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,400
I talked a lot.

2729
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,840
When I went in, they said,

2730
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,400
I said, "Hello, I'm Harry."

2731
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,080
I'm INFJ.

2732
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,030
After 10 minutes,

2733
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:26,640
Are you really an introvert?

2734
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,030
You've been questioning me

2735
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:29,400
Am I an introvert?

2736
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,520
But on the second and third day,

2737
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,440
I didn't talk much today.

2738
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,590
Because it's already cooked.

2739
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,000
You were so talkative just now.

2740
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,240
This is the first time we met.

2741
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,280
It's okay. We'll get to know each other again.

2742
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,590
No, it won't be like this tomorrow.

2743
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:44,920
Okay.

2744
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,200
Fortunately, I'm an introvert.

2745
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,550
I was wondering how we could talk.

2746
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:48,800
I (introverted) and I (introverted)...

2747
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,600
with me.

2748
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,200
Let me tell you.

2749
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:54,360
If you want to go on a date,

2750
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,920
or hang out with someone else?

2751
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,950
do you think it's someone who talks a lot

2752
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,200
or someone who talks less?

2753
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,440
He must be talkative.

2754
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,720
ISFJ, right?

2755
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,280
J.

2756
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:05,440
I have a plan.

2757
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,910
But...

2758
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,390
I understand.

2759
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:08,240
You belong to

2760
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,000
If someone else is better at making plans,

2761
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,200
I'm willing to let him do it.

2762
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:11,640
Yes.

2763
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,760
But if that person

2764
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:13,310
P,

2765
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:14,270
you can make this plan.

2766
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:16,190
Yes.

2767
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:17,520
We need a plan.

2768
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,110
I think so.

2769
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,040
Yes.

2770
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,190
I agree.

2771
01:53:20,190 --> 01:53:22,360
We actually finished our date yesterday.

2772
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,600
So you had a date yesterday?

2773
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,440
Yes.

2774
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,550
I was on a date yesterday.

2775
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:29,240
I felt like a good friend.

2776
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:30,800
We just met, but...

2777
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,920
No, I think my first sight was very accurate.

2778
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,640
You thought we were friends at first sight.

2779
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,310
you can't develop anymore.

2780
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,640
And I'm someone

2781
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,200
If we were good friends,

2782
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,480
I wouldn't be a (lover).

2783
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,150
Yes.

2784
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,000
Hold on.

2785
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm a bit full.

2786
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,240
Didn't you hear that it's ripe?

2787
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,080
I don't want to hear it.

2788
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,720
Actually, I really want to guess the love line.

2789
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,480
I guessed it on the first day.

2790
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,800
Can you guess mine?

2791
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,200
Can you guess it?

2792
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:11,230
Only you have intentions.

2793
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:12,400
Or your brother?

2794
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:12,990
I meant it.

2795
01:54:12,990 --> 01:54:13,790
I can guess it.

2796
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,320
You can never guess.

2797
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,520
I can guess it all.

2798
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:21,680
Not folding.

2799
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,030
Not folding.

2800
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,000
I look forward to it.

2801
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,840
to predict him.

2802
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,830
Can I guess?

2803
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,720
Yes.

2804
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,920
We only talk about the first sight.

2805
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,520
Are you sure you want to say it now?

2806
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,160
Because two girls haven't arrived.

2807
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,990
Take a guess.

2808
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:45,920
I think

2809
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,520
you don't remember his name at all.

2810
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,150
I know the order.

2811
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:51,230
One to the right side of Harry

2812
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:52,160
In the middle, two.

2813
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,240
Then three.

2814
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,680
Okay, let's guess each other.

2815
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,040
Okay.

2816
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,790
Really?

2817
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:58,800
Tell us.

2818
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,670
I think three.

2819
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,760
Say something.

2820
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,600
I think neither of you can guess it.

2821
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,640
Maybe.

2822
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,760
Tell me.

2823
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,710
I didn't know

2824
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:20,640
you are actually

2825
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,400
If you're interested in someone,

2826
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,440
you will deliberately avoid it.

2827
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,830
Yes, intentionally. Yes.

2828
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:25,950
I'm like this.

2829
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,400
The three girls

2830
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,550
a little bit in front of one.

2831
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,310
But I'll avoid it.

2832
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,080
It's my turn to ask you.

2833
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,110
You can ask me.

2834
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:46,750
I'll ask Fatty first.

2835
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,960
What type of girl do you like?

2836
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,160
I like Fang.

2837
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,360
I get along with my personality.

2838
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,270
and cheerful.

2839
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:55,480
It seems that

2840
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,720
hobbies are very important.

2841
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,840
You need to

2842
01:55:58,840 --> 01:55:59,710
have a good chat.

2843
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:01,760
I must have common hobbies.

2844
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:03,920
We are very similar.

2845
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:04,320
Yes.

2846
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,790
Because I'm an E

2847
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,720
an outgoing person.

2848
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,400
Maybe I'm more

2849
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,520
In this way,

2850
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,600
we can do many things together.

2851
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:15,070
Will you take the initiative to the female guest you like?

2852
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:15,710
I am.

2853
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:16,480
You are?

2854
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,720
I'm completely opposite of you in this aspect.

2855
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,320
Do you take the initiative?

2856
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,480
He's just like me.

2857
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,160
He means...

2858
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:30,430
If the girl you like

2859
01:56:30,430 --> 01:56:32,960
there are two people in love at this time,

2860
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,510
will you choose

2861
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:37,630
wait or give in?

2862
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:39,800
Or do you want me to go too?

2863
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,670
Will you fight for it?

2864
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,440
I will wait.

2865
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,270
You will wait.

2866
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:43,200
But

2867
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,560
if the girls will respond to me,

2868
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:46,750
I'll take the initiative.

2869
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:51,520
If you don't take the initiative,

2870
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,150
if you don't take the initiative?

2871
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:54,160
I mean

2872
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:55,320
maybe one of the two boys

2873
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,080
she might take my side.

2874
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,440
and give me some information.

2875
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:07,480
You'll try to communicate with her

2876
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,520
and see if she'll give me this response.

2877
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,240
If I did, I would...

2878
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:11,480
you would take the initiative.

2879
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,800
But you won't be too active.

2880
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:13,360
Yes.

2881
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,480
Okay.

2882
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:19,280
Well...

2883
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,670
I just said

2884
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:22,480
We're friends now, right?

2885
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,520
Give me five.

2886
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,240
Fair competition.

2887
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,040
OK. No problem.

2888
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,760
I agree.

2889
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,120
Right, I just said

2890
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,080
we might be

2891
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,240
the same girl.

2892
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:38,430
That's what I mean.

2893
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:39,870
I didn't mean

2894
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:41,680
I thought you were passive like me.

2895
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,480
Yes, you were passive too.

2896
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,000
Right?

2897
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,280
Yes.

2898
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,360
I think it's good.

2899
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,830
We all know it.

2900
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:51,600
This is fair to everyone.

2901
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,840
Su Su's eyes are always on Terri.

2902
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,360
I think

2903
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,560
I'm more handsome than him.

2904
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,320
But he has a better temperament than me.

2905
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,870
He makes me feel threatened.

2906
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:00,760
and pressure.

2907
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,160
But fair competition

2908
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,120
Compared to soup,

2909
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:04,880
I can cook.

2910
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,270
I think this is my advantage.

2911
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:07,960
I may be more mature

2912
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,590
and more interesting.

2913
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,360
What are you doing?

2914
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,640
It's nothing.

2915
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:17,950
Fatty said luckily there was no conflict with me.

2916
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:20,600
No.

2917
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,400
See you tonight.

2918
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:32,830
Okay.

2919
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:33,880
See you later.

2920
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,040
Bye.

2921
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,040
Good morning.

2922
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,120
How are you?

2923
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,190
Not bad.

2924
01:58:44,190 --> 01:58:45,790
We just went up the altitude.

2925
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:46,560
It's going up.

2926
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,520
What height?

2927
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,800
I really can't tell you this.

2928
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,200
This is a secret.

2929
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,670
Exciting.

2930
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:53,680
How exciting.

2931
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,960
Which one do you think

2932
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,480
my first impression of?

2933
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,110
My brother.

2934
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,990
How did you guess Xinxin?

2935
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,200
No.

2936
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:03,640
No?

2937
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,280
No, it's a little funny.

2938
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:07,520
It's so funny, cube.

2939
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,120
This is so fun.

2940
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,920
It seems right after a long round.

2941
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,750
But it doesn't seem right.

2942
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,160
Why not?

2943
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:12,880
Really? Inner?

2944
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,790
Don't you think so?

2945
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,760
Probably.

2946
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:23,840
I'm just like him.

2947
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:25,470
It's okay.

2948
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:27,390
So why don't the three of us live together?

2949
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:27,870
Sure.

2950
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,920
I need to use the bathroom.

2951
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,480
Okay, go ahead.

2952
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,640
Thank you for your permission.

2953
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,520
Hello.

2954
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,110
Hello

2955
01:59:58,110 --> 02:00:00,400
The third person I saw was soup.

2956
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,440
Soup?

2957
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,710
His appearance is unique.

2958
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:05,440
and distinctive.

2959
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,080
Hello.

2960
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,120
How should I address you?

2961
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,640
Just call me Soup.

2962
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,470
Soup?

2963
02:00:13,470 --> 02:00:14,110
Yes.

2964
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:16,000
You can call me Tata.

2965
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,200
Tata.

2966
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:18,270
Okay.

2967
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:22,160
Nice to meet you.

2968
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,080
A little cold.

2969
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,680
You're an introvert E.

2970
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,120
I am. Take a guess.

2971
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:53,400
Little I (introverted).

2972
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,440
E.

2973
02:00:57,470 --> 02:00:59,800
Not really.

2974
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,760
No.

2975
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:04,400
You are E.

2976
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,160
I'm an outgoing person.

2977
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:08,000
E is not.

2978
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,440
You are not E.

2979
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:17,630
Are you here alone?

2980
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:19,710
Yes.

2981
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:22,750
Okay.

2982
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,600
How many people did you meet?

2983
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,600
Guess.

2984
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,400
Two.

2985
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:32,830
No.

2986
02:01:33,630 --> 02:01:34,480
I'm the first one.

2987
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:42,680
So you just arrived?

2988
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,320
Yes.

2989
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:47,120
I took a photo of you when you were young.

2990
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,440
A childhood photo?

2991
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,080
Let me see.

2992
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,880
I thought he was a foreigner.

2993
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,430
He looks like a half-blood.

2994
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:56,670
I'm a mixed.

2995
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:57,520
Which part?

2996
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,040
China, America.

2997
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:02,320
Okay.

2998
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,280
I think you had a bite of this blueberry.

2999
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,880
I didn't have dinner.

3000
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:10,360
Eat more.

3001
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,030
I actually ate a lot.

3002
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:15,200
It's okay. I'll drink some water.

3003
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:28,760
How did you get along in the house the other day?

3004
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:32,280
I felt quite reserved at first.

3005
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:35,870
Do you have

3006
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:38,320
in the house?

3007
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,080
Something like that?

3008
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:40,960
Yes.

3009
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:42,720
Yes.

3010
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:46,110
Did you have a date?

3011
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:48,600
Yes.

3012
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:01,040
What do you usually do?

3013
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:04,030
Maybe in sports,

3014
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,470
For example,

3015
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,800
Do you want to guess

3016
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:16,080
I'm actually a semi-professional.

3017
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,310
I'm working out.

3018
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,320
Sports?

3019
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:24,350
Basketball.

3020
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:25,040
Basketball.

3021
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:28,990
You look tall.

3022
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,200
How tall are you?

3023
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,520
I don't know about 1.85 meters to 1.9m.

3024
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:34,720
It's too much.

3025
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:35,920
1.85 meters to 1.9m.

3026
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,600
Actually, the reason of my exercise

3027
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:42,840
I have a little chest, a little hunchback.

3028
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:46,960
Tennis.

3029
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,920
Tennis on the table.

3030
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,240
table tennis.

3031
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:50,880
Ping-pong. Will it be like this?

3032
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,320
Because you are

3033
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,040
The stage is so high.

3034
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,200
You have to play on your knees.

3035
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,790
I thought tall guys play basketball.

3036
02:03:57,790 --> 02:04:00,000
What about you? Can I ask about your occupation?

3037
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,630
Sure.

3038
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:04,080
I guess models.

3039
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:05,920
Is it so easy to guess?

3040
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:06,960
How?

3041
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,000
Because the new guy

3042
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,560
I knew he was a model too.

3043
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,080
Is he a model too?

3044
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:14,200
You didn't know?

3045
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,080
I've never seen anyone.

3046
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:23,390
That's interesting.

3047
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,670
My brothers

3048
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:25,720
are almost the same.

3049
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:26,480
I'm a little confused now.

3050
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,240
You're almost right.

3051
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,880
Is it easy to guess your brothers?

3052
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,000
It's hard to guess.

3053
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,270
You can only

3054
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:34,800
and details

3055
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,600
can be guessed.

3056
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:38,720
For example, when something happens,

3057
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:43,710
when something happens.

3058
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:46,110
Who is the first person he looked at?

3059
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,600
Normally, he would guess it through this information.

3060
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,720
So you'll ask your brothers for help.

3061
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,400
quietly.

3062
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:52,760
No.

3063
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:54,080
I should know this.

3064
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:57,520
I'll take the initiative to avoid this.

3065
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,830
My brother and I are a little obvious.

3066
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:02,240
A little.

3067
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,760
You've already guessed it.

3068
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,360
We already guessed it.

3069
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,600
But I'm not sure if you're right.

3070
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:08,990
Maybe.

3071
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:10,270
I'll go back tonight.

3072
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:11,160
Okay.

3073
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,670
We're siblings.

3074
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:15,520
I think the soup

3075
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,880
It gives me

3076
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,920
a dull feeling.

3077
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,200
Among the three boys,

3078
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,790
He just doesn't know where to go.

3079
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:28,800
Let me reply.

3080
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,760
Okay.

3081
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:54,880
I have to go.

3082
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,160
Okay. See you later.

3083
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:56,670
Bye.

3084
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:59,000
Nice to meet you.

3085
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:03,800
You'll be a good friend.

3086
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,110
The first time you saw her,

3087
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:07,640
This is it.

3088
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,360
Because she's not so arrogant.

3089
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:13,880
and she kept laughing.

3090
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,480
We were smiling.

3091
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:19,870
for so long.

3092
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,240
What?

3093
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:22,080
What took you so long?

3094
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,200
No, only three minutes.

3095
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,640
Okay.

3096
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,600
What?

3097
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,440
Why are you laughing?

3098
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:28,990
Nothing.

3099
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:29,950
I want to laugh at you, OK?

3100
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:32,080
Yes.

3101
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:33,880
What do you want to know about us?

3102
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:34,160
Because...

3103
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:34,800
I think

3104
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:37,200
I have some questions.

3105
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:37,950
About you

3106
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:40,640
About your date,

3107
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,360
not siblings.

3108
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:41,950
Partner?

3109
02:06:41,950 --> 02:06:42,240
Yes.

3110
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,480
The one you like

3111
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:45,950
In a relationship,

3112
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:46,840
in love

3113
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:48,030
or emotional?

3114
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:49,360
I want to be rational.

3115
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,280
But I'm always emotional.

3116
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:53,790
We're the same.

3117
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:55,520
We'll just have a slap and a punch.

3118
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,480
One more.

3119
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,000
We are the same.

3120
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I'm just like him.

3121
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,110
I may not be alone

3122
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:03,200
I'm not alone at all.

3123
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,400
I was very rational before I fell in love.

3124
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:05,720
in many things.

3125
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,070
But after I fell in love,

3126
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:08,120
a "loser" lover.

3127
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,790
Me?

3128
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,960
the same?

3129
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:12,670
I'm rational.

3130
02:07:12,670 --> 02:07:13,240
Reason?

3131
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,400
I'm rational.

3132
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,160
Actually, it's good to be rational.

3133
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:16,640
More rational.

3134
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,600
Reason will make you happy.

3135
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:18,560
I'm more rational.

3136
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:30,640
I need to go to the toilet.

3137
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:32,880
Okay?

3138
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,710
I need to go to the toilet.

3139
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,000
Go ahead.

3140
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,270
I'm going to organize my makeup.

3141
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:54,520
What do you think?

3142
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,360
How is it? Let's talk.

3143
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,600
I'm not telling you.

3144
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:03,160
How could you say that?

3145
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:05,760
They asked me about my first impression.

3146
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,400
Because I saw three girls

3147
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,440
I saw three girls.

3148
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:11,800
Three?

3149
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:12,240
Yes.

3150
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,720
There's a boy and a girl.

3151
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:15,680
They are working today.

3152
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,030
Yes.

3153
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:17,440
I only met three girls.

3154
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:23,230
Then they asked me

3155
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:24,440
question you.

3156
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:24,720
Yes.

3157
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,040
You must choose one among the three girls.

3158
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,480
Who will you be more interested in?

3159
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,080
The three of them were wrong.

3160
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,390
So

3161
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:32,120
there are people

3162
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:34,270
in the house.

3163
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:38,320
You can't say that.

3164
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:41,150
Someone you're interested in.

3165
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:41,520
Yes.

3166
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:44,830
The first impression may be more interested

3167
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:46,720
one of the three girls.

3168
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,400
So you've already moved in?

3169
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,070
Yes.

3170
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:52,080
How is it?

3171
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,470
When we just entered, we were all together.

3172
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:59,280
and have a chat.

3173
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,840
It's still a little awkward.

3174
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,670
But everyone is nice.

3175
02:09:04,670 --> 02:09:08,600
They'll say it's more touching.

3176
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:10,640
some topics.

3177
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:12,800
What activities do you have tonight?

3178
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,600
Let me join you quickly.

3179
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,440
Before entering the house,

3180
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,630
they were playing games.

3181
02:09:17,630 --> 02:09:18,320
They're already playing.

3182
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,280
Yes, we're playing games.

3183
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,960
We sat together

3184
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:21,560
and played.

3185
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,880
They have a box

3186
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,960
a box like Truth or Dare.

3187
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,190
You draw.

3188
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:29,840
If you have questions,

3189
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:30,560
You can ask others.

3190
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,280
or others.

3191
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,470
Are there any activities tonight?

3192
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:34,840
I think so.

3193
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,400
You or them?

3194
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,040
They organize.

3195
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,040
I came later.

3196
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,790
Yes, we'll follow the arrangement.

3197
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:44,080
Okay.

3198
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:47,600
That sounds fun.

3199
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:49,600
Did you talk about

3200
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,200
did you

3201
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,400
a little...

3202
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:54,560
I won't tell you.

3203
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,120
I won't tell you.

3204
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,560
Okay.

3205
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:01,680
How do you feel?

3206
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,480
Guess.

3207
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:05,470
I guess you are

3208
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:06,560
Soup.

3209
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,200
Right?

3210
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,110
I'm not telling you.

3211
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:14,160
Do you know how I chose them?

3212
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:15,550
You chose them.

3213
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,160
Then why am I the last one?

3214
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,680
I didn't choose you.

3215
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,360
Okay.

3216
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:22,800
He gets angry right away.

3217
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,160
No.

3218
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:24,280
I chose it.

3219
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:25,840
You have to plan for me.

3220
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,880
So you should...

3221
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:27,710
So I asked them some questions

3222
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:28,510
ask them some questions.

3223
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:30,270
What kind of girls do they like?

3224
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:31,520
And...

3225
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:32,960
I didn't ask them that.

3226
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,680
So what did you ask?

3227
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,320
Almost.

3228
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:39,000
We need to resonate

3229
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,120
and have common hobbies.

3230
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:42,430
and get along well.

3231
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:43,000
Yes.

3232
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,120
It's almost the same.

3233
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:46,680
I actually want to eat blueberries.

3234
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:47,440
Let's eat.

3235
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,160
I think Harry wants to eat it.

3236
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:53,680
Harry really eats a lot.

3237
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:54,520
We just had dinner.

3238
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,680
he should eat the most.

3239
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:58,720
He kept touching his stomach.

3240
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:01,310
So we...

3241
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,680
In their eyes,

3242
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,360
we are siblings.

3243
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:07,160
Yeah.

3244
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:10,720
I'm telling you.

3245
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,990
It's not easy for me to play your brother.

3246
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:20,960
You know what?

3247
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,480
It's not easy for me to play your brother.

3248
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:43,120
Hello.

3249
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,120
I feel like I've seen you before.

3250
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:46,560
I think I've seen you before.

3251
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:48,990
Okay.

3252
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:52,000
You can call me Tata.

3253
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:53,360
How should I address you?

3254
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:54,360
You can call me Terri.

3255
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,070
It's an English name.

3256
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:55,680
Yes.

3257
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,040
Open it first.

3258
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:03,390
Okay.

3259
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,720
See if there's any problem.

3260
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:15,680
Introduce you and your brother to them.

3261
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:17,280
But besides age,

3262
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:19,710
except age.

3263
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,400
Go ahead.

3264
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,640
I have a brother.

3265
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:26,000
He's three years older than me.

3266
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,640
Same as me.

3267
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,280
as me.

3268
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:32,880
He may talk more than you,

3269
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,680
but he's gentle

3270
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:36,920
and calm.

3271
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:39,360
And I

3272
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,760
I have a sister.

3273
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:43,920
But she's seven years older than me.

3274
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:44,990
When I was young,

3275
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:46,400
he would take care of me

3276
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,760
I might play the role of my mom.

3277
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:51,520
My parents may be busy with work.

3278
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,760
I even think you know my brothers.

3279
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:58,800
Maybe I do.

3280
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,710
Really?

3281
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:01,360
We met in Shanghai before.

3282
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,520
Because once on the road,

3283
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,080
we met

3284
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,470
You were with your brother.

3285
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:08,280
Okay, I remember now.

3286
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:08,830
Do you remember?

3287
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:09,790
I remember everything.

3288
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:10,400
Do you remember?

3289
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,800
It's closed.

3290
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:12,510
It's closed now.

3291
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,760
I didn't expect it was you.

3292
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,800
I was surprised.

3293
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,270
At first, I thought

3294
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:19,640
I would live in a small house.

3295
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:21,760
I wasn't familiar with the place.

3296
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,070
I don't know anyone.

3297
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:25,280
I suddenly feel a familiar

3298
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,680
I feel relaxed.

3299
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,600
Surprise.

3300
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:33,240
It seems to be fate.

3301
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:34,400
It's like destiny.

3302
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:37,920
Go ahead.

3303
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,880
I'll get it.

3304
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:46,960
Take a look.

3305
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:48,920
Let's watch it together.

3306
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:52,190
We will join

3307
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,470
as a special identity.

3308
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:54,880
Please do what's below.

3309
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:56,960
Don't reveal our real identity.

3310
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,590
We need to disguise ourselves as siblings.

3311
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:00,030
(to fake the truth.)

3312
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:02,880
Don't tell anyone about our first meeting.

3313
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:03,960
It's okay. We're real siblings.

3314
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:04,440
Let me tell you.

3315
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:05,560
Okay.

3316
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,480
Two privileges.

3317
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,120
Before we announce our relationship,

3318
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:09,720
he entered the siblings' house every night

3319
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:12,320
and share stories with their own brothers.

3320
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,320
Everyone has a chance to go on a date with Cupid.

3321
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:15,710
Easy.

3322
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:16,830
Very easy.

3323
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:18,080
What do you think?

3324
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,600
Do you think you can do it well?

3325
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,030
Yes.

3326
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:22,680
It's a bag.

3327
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:23,480
To be honest,

3328
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:25,470
your brother and I are quite close.

3329
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:27,360
I know what kind of person he is.

3330
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:27,680
Okay.

3331
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:29,310
We may meet less often.

3332
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:31,120
I played with them a lot.

3333
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:31,760
So when I came in,

3334
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,280
I said you looked familiar.

3335
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:34,480
Yes.

3336
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,280
Let's continue.

3337
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:36,830
I'll do it.

3338
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:37,440
Okay.

3339
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:42,110
What support do you want me

3340
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:44,000
in the house?

3341
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,240
Do you need my help?

3342
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:47,480
I need you to identify men for me.

3343
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,480
A bag.

3344
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:52,030
Check it from your man's perspective.

3345
02:14:52,030 --> 02:14:54,520
If you have feelings for someone,

3346
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,360
I can help you.

3347
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:57,880
I can ask around for you.

3348
02:14:57,880 --> 02:14:58,640
Okay.

3349
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,440
It's mutual.

3350
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,400
Okay.

3351
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,430
I suddenly feel like I really have a brother.

3352
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,440
We're not siblings.

3353
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:05,520
It seems that we are

3354
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:06,200
we are not siblings.

3355
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,160
It seems that we might be...

3356
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:09,470
Yes.

3357
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,760
Let's decide the order of you entering the house.

3358
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:14,430
I'll go first.

3359
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:15,360
You go first.

3360
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,560
You can ask around first.

3361
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,360
Get along with them first.

3362
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:18,960
and get close to them.

3363
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,240
Then take me in.

3364
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:21,080
Sure.

3365
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:24,240
Let's pack up and move in.

3366
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:24,560
Okay.

3367
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:25,560
I'll wait for your good news.

3368
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,280
Remember to pick me up.

3369
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,240
I'll come as your brother.

3370
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:30,520
I'll go first.

3371
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,040
Okay.

3372
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:31,710
Ask around.

3373
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:32,320
Okay.

3374
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,560
Are you still nervous?

3375
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:35,360
I'm fine.

3376
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:35,920
Really?

3377
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,470
But it's a little...

3378
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:37,920
Just like me.

3379
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:39,280
It's the same when I went into the house.

3380
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:40,480
But everyone

3381
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,400
It's good that you're integrated.

3382
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,600
Everyone is

3383
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,390
quite relaxed.

3384
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:50,800
There's a text message.

3385
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:53,630
Okay.

3386
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:54,880
I'm going back.

3387
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,360
Okay.

3388
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:55,840
Okay.

3389
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:56,600
Okay, bye.

3390
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:56,960
See you later.
