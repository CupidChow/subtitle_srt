Let's have some wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,920
Did you get along with other girls today?

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,400
Beauty or...

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,320
One.

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,800
It feels like we'll have some wild wine right away.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,960
It's fluffy.

10
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,760
a party with wild wine.

19

It's exclusively sponsored by Guoli.

is sponsored by

22

for the sponsorship of

23
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,680
We are

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
a family member.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,960
Welcome.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Today is a good day.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
Guoli is small. We have a new family.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Hello, everyone.

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,880
I'm singer Ziying Zhang.

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
I'll intervene.

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,040
No.

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,079
I'm intervening.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
I'm here to eat sugar.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,120
Hello, everyone.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll intervene.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,079
Hello.

37
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm Mi-na.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
I'm very happy

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
of "Love Sisters".

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
I cried a lot in the previous episodes.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,680
I think

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,720
Ziying will intervene.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,760
I'll heal it.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay.

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Yes.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,640
I have a biological sister.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,000
How old is she?

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Five years.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Welcome Mi-na from the siblings' perspective.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm an only child.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,440
But I really

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
want a brother and sister.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
Even if he treats me badly.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Aren't you the female version of Jiang Dunhao?

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,280
What a coincidence. We also have

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
who wants a sister.

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Do you also want her to treat you badly?

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Me too.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
I just want him

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,320
as long as he exists.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,920
Let me tell you.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
Sometimes when they don't have it, they want it.

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't want it if I do.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,680
Yes.

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
So actually

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,920
there are brothers, sisters, younger brothers and sisters.

67
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
In school,

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,920
Will I help you when I'm bullied?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,760
But here's the thing.

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,280
My family

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
For example, when I was bullied in school,

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
My brother beat others up.

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,960
But he hit me at home.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,920
So I was hit constant.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Double.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
Why?

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah.

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,000
He thinks

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,480
no one can bully my sister.

80
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,760
But if you are naughty between us,

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I can bully you.

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,120
He has such a strange thought.

83
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
He cares about face when he's outside.

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,640
My sister can't be bullied.

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,600
Because I'm here.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm the only one who can bully my sister.

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
Yes, if you don't give me face,

88
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,680
If you bully my sister, you don't give me face.

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,440
I want to get hit.

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,640
No.

91
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
I want to get hit.

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
I want a brother.

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,280
Okay. Here.

94
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Take a look.

95
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,839
Thank you for growing up with me.

96
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Hua.

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
I want to eat the noodles

98
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,839
you made that night.

99
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,400
You have to wait for a while if you eat noodles.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,480
Hua.

101
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,520
Come here.

102
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,760
Here.

103
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,080
Hurry up with the soup.

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Girls rely on flowers.

105
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,120
Boys rely on Harry.

106
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,320
Did you eat it yourself?

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Not yet.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
Eat later.

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
That's it?

110
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,480
Hurry up.

111
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
Thank you for coming.

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,560
It's really delicious.

113
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,320
It's good to give her feedback.

114
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,040
You have to respond.

115
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Yes, he responded.

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,760
Map.

117
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,240
Eat the noodles first.

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
Okay.

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll listen to you.

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
Do you want some glutinous rice balls?

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,960
No.

122
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,320
Glutinous rice balls are too greasy.

123
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
But only a little bit of noodles.

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
How about this small one?

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Here.

126
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Sure.

127
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,920
Let's have another bowl of glutinous rice balls.

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Because there's no size left.

129
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,520
I don't need to give it to him.

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
Who is the big one?

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Fatty.

132
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,480
Hua.

133
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,840
You can eat big food.

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
He doesn't need to eat too much.

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
This is too small.

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Map

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,920
Anyway, this is from the Tu family

138
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,760
He often eats it.

139
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,920
I can eat a lot.

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
Now only I'm fat.

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
His bowl...

142
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Fatty, come and eat.

143
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,080
The noodles Hua made for you are soggy.

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Don't miss it.

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
You have to treat it equally, okay?

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's really soggy.

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,280
Half an hour is fine.

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
That's all.

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,000
The big bowl Hua specially left for you.

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,760
I believe it.

151
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,760
Look at this kind of person. OK.

152
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't cook for him.

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
I won't do it again.

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,960
I won't.

155
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,440
I said I believe you.

156
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
I didn't say anything else.

157
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
I have something for you. Come here.

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I have something for you.

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
What is it?

160
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,440
When you put on makeup for me,

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
your makeup was almost gone.

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,159
What is this?

163
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,880
A concealer.

164
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
No way.

165
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,520
He's so meticulous.

166
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,760
I don't know.

167
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,880
What should I do?

168
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,720
Thank you.

169
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,280
This is a bonus.

170
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,040
You only have eyes for her when you like someone.

171
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,680
right?

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Maybe I didn't even notice it.

173
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm running out of that.

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
I was considered.

175
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
The key is

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
he cares about

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,520
about your details.

178
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,880
I think

179
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Harry only had

180
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
all the pagodas.

181
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
It feels like a radar

182
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,360
I've been shooting you

183
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
from head to toe.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,880
See if you need anything.

185
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,520
you need.

186
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,400
I think Harry

187
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,880
is quite suitable for

188
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,560
For example, a boy

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
who wants to pursue a girl

190
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,880
is eye contact.

191
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,360
I think he's good at this.

192
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
So attractive, right?

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
Because for girls,

194
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
a man is so straightforward.

195
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
But it's the same with Tata.

196
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,720
I've never seen Tata before.

197
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Both of them are straight.

198
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,560
Her eyes are big.

199
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
She kept staring at them.

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
So I think

201
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,520
a battle between masters.

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,320
You're staring at me too.

203
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Me too.

204
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
We can look at each other directly.

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,640
My old friend.

206
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you miss me?

207
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,720
What map?

208
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
You got a text.

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,640
(To members of the house.)

210
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,360
A new week has begun.

211
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,480
I've prepared

212
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
for you.

213
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Please go to

214
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,000
to the designated location.

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
for dinner.

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,600
Bye.

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,480
It's really eye-catching.

218
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,360
Thank you for growing up with me.

219
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,280
This is so beautiful.

220
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
I want to drink fruit cubes.

221
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
I really saw them drinking for so long.

222
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
How can we sit?

223
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Sit. Where?

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,480
Sit here.

225
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
Fragrant juice wine.

226
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,160
What should I do?

227
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm in a crisis.

228
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,560
He's so warm-hearted.

229
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,400
How to sit?

230
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,920
Sit over there.

231
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,840
Nice.

232
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Do you want to sit together

233
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,360
Thank you.

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
Thank you.

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Oh, no. I got into trouble again.

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
What should we eat?

237
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
Anything.

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,480
They can't wait to stick together.

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll move them back after eating.

240
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you want it?

241
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll share it with you.

242
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,440
Okay.

243
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
Get me some paper.

244
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Show us your siblings.

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
So cute.

246
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,320
Map. Such big ears.

247
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
My son is

248
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,240
a bright boy.

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Show your siblings

250
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,280
They say daughters are moms' little cotton jackets

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
Flowers are beautiful when they are born

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,760
You don't look like an old man.

253
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
What a low standard.

254
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,560
He doesn't look like an old man.

255
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,440
I think my son

256
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,360
a standard man.

257
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,160
He's always been easy-going.

258
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
I want to cry.

259
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
Show your siblings.

260
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
My son is reliable.

261
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
What I'm proud of is that

262
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
he can insist on doing something

263
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,480
and persistent.

264
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,240
My daughter is a very caring

265
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
and pretty.

266
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,600
who can understand others.

267
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,600
Xinxin, you're great.

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Trust yourself.

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
Do it well.

270
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,560
I can't watch others cry.

271
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,040
I want tissues.

272
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm going to play the video of my parents today.

273
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
It was a bit

274
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,160
a little tearful.

275
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,080
I haven't seen my parents for a long time.

276
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,880
So I couldn't control myself.

277
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,040
I keep crying

278
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,000
I feel my mom is getting old

279
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,200
I suddenly got emotional

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,320
Because at the moment

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
at the moment

282
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,600
I was a little emotional.

283
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Show us your siblings.

284
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll announce it.

285
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,120
The relationship between siblings will be announced soon.

286
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
Show us your siblings.

287
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,640
Show us your siblings.

288
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,520
Show us your siblings.

289
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,600
Show us your siblings.

290
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:40,880
What?

291
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,560
I knew it.

292
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I knew it.

293
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes.

294
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,360
I've thought about siblings before.

295
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm pretty sure.

296
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,080
In the letter segment,

297
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,600
Susu and Harry are both in the UK.

298
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,320
I knew it.

299
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Susu and Harry are siblings.

300
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
The siblings in the small house are public.

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
There's a big difference.

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm deeply touched.

303
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,000
A girl.

304
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,960
She's more attentive.

305
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,040
So detailed that when I was young,

306
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,200
Show your siblings.

307
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
You can't touch dirty things.

308
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,440
But son is not like that.

309
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
I think boys

310
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,320
Touch it if you want.

311
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,120
It's relaxing.

312
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,280
Susu was at

313
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
at a Chinese school.

314
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,880
I was going to send her abroad.

315
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,360
I remember this time clearly.

316
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,000
She went there in August 2013.

317
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
She was born under September.

318
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
I came back to China

319
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,680
after her birthday.

320
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,560
Because two younger brothers

321
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,640
I can't accompany her abroad.

322
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
My siblings were disclosed.

323
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm indebted to those years.

324
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,920
My siblings were disclosed.

325
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,800
So she went abroad

326
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,120
to study abroad.

327
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,160
In 2013,

328
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
I was just a teenager.

329
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,680
The siblings in the small house were made public.

330
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,000
If I have to choose

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,640
If I can't be with you,

332
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,680
I won't send my child out.

333
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes.

334
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,040
Think about it.

335
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,600
a little girl went to a foreign country

336
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,720
to a completely strange city.

337
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
Now I think

338
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,560
the pressure and growth

339
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,640
and growth.

340
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I went abroad when I was young.

341
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,760
I was alone in England.

342
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,960
So I think at that age,

343
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,280
at that time

344
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,680
a good view of life

345
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
and world view,

346
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
it's not good

347
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,960
to go abroad alone.

348
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,880
I think

349
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,840
I've always been

350
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,520
sensitive and internal consumption.

351
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,360
In junior high,

352
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,320
there was too much pressure from the girls' school.

353
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,240
I wanted to transfer to a school.

354
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
After I changed to another school,

355
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
I couldn't draw.

356
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,480
that I like.

357
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,520
I sit in front of the table

358
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
for two days and two nights.

359
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,680
I just want to draw it well.

360
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,600
But because

361
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
the more anxious you are, the more afraid you are.

362
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
You don't dare to go to class because you can't finish it.

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
I was afraid of being scolded by the teacher.

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,040
I was afraid of being criticized.

365
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,520
I couldn't draw well.

366
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,560
Then I fell into a dead loop.

367
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,080
I was very anxious.

368
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,840
I dare not go to school.

369
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,160
She was in puberty.

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Her anxiety at that time

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
was relatively serious.

372
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,640
She has physical reaction.

373
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,880
She'll be nervous.

374
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,760
Her hands are sweating.

375
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,080
Like when there are many people, she squats down.

376
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Like that.

377
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,760
Show your siblings

378
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,520
Show your siblings.

379
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
At that time,

380
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,400
a dance training institution.

381
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,920
I started learning dancing when I was 13.

382
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,760
Chinese dance, ethnic dance

383
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,240
until the third year.

384
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,600
35 years old.

385
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Over 20 years.

386
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
when I was pregnant with the third child,

387
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,760
I was still teaching the students.

388
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
But after giving birth to the third child,

389
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,840
the mission of two children and three children

390
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
are totally different.

391
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,160
You have a younger brother.

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,720
So I've actually

393
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,040
for the family.

394
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
I feel a lot of things suddenly came up.

395
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm choosing my career and my family.

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
I really fought for a long time.

397
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,640
In the end, I chose to return to my family

398
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,520
to take care of my child.

399
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,640
The most important thing is responsibility.

400
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,480
Because I have three children.

401
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
I have to educate them and guide them.

402
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,760
But now I don't regret it at all.

403
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,800
The weakness

404
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
The lack of Susu

405
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,480
is the biggest problem in my life.

406
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes.

407
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,160
It's okay.

408
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,080
She grew up well.

409
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,720
I always thought

410
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
they may not remember

411
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,120
remember or not.

412
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,360
Actually, they don't usually say this.

413
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
or tell me.

414
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,240
or apologize to me.

415
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,920
or anything.

416
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,320
For the first time,

417
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,360
I saw them like this.

418
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
Yeah, this makes

419
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
their communication.

420
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
Maybe Susu never knew

421
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
I feel guilty about this.

422
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm an adult now.

423
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,560
I can figure it out.

424
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,760
Because I was the first child,

425
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,280
So they don't know

426
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,240
how to educate

427
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,319
or companionship.

428
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,880
I think

429
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
better than my sister.

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Because

431
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,599
Like I said, parents are more experienced

432
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,319
they'll take more care of me.

433
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,200
Since it has happened,

434
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,880
it can't be changed.

435
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,400
If you think it's unfair now,

436
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,839
make up for this fairness.

437
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,839
That's enough.

438
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,080
How to make up for my sister?

439
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
Just spend more time with her

440
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
and make her happy.

441
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,320
Let her do what she wants to do.

442
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,280
What she wants to do?

443
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,440
My son is a family-oriented

444
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
and a man.

445
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,040
I've been her brother since childhood.

446
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,960
He is more mature

447
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,400
and good at taking care of his sister.

448
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,360
When I was young, my brother went to a restaurant

449
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
he would bring me something

450
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,960
he would bring me something.

451
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
He also brings me something he has.

452
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,640
Because he will always think of me.

453
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm jealous.

454
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,920
Like I said,

455
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
Make up for it if you can.

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,640
If you can't make it up, try to make it up.

457
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,760
Judging from

458
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,600
in the past two days,

459
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
he's just like this.

460
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,960
He's very attentive

461
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,920
and considerate.

462
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,040
Although he is Susu's brother,

463
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,240
he takes good care of his sister.

464
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,560
His siblings were made public.

465
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,520
I hope my daughter

466
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,960
can find her other half in the show.

467
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,440
who loves and loves her.

468
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,880
Show your siblings.

469
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,760
Do you have any other requests?

470
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,520
If there's any hope,

471
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,480
you must choose someone you love

472
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,160
and show yourself bravely.

473
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Let those who like you

474
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,600
who love you

475
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,840
can have the chance

476
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,080
to be with you in the future.

477
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,320
Okay.

478
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
I asked you to choose the one you love.

479
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
The most memorable thing is

480
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,680
Susu and Harry.

481
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,880
My understanding of Harry

482
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,160
I think he's actually

483
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,240
a very thoughtful man.

484
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,960
He's quite straightforward.

485
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,840
Very straightforward.

486
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,640
My observation

487
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
his love for his sister and family

488
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,920
He expresses his love.

489
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,680
and emotions.

490
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,760
I can feel his parents.

491
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,760
their parents are devoted to their children.

492
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,720
They know how to express love.

493
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Hello, I'm Su Ziyi.

494
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,280
He is my brother,

495
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,160
Su Zihao.

496
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
I'm not used to it.

497
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,480
He suddenly said his name.

498
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
OK, Zihao.

499
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,600
They...

500
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,720
Show us your siblings.

501
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
So beautiful.

502
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
So beautiful.

503
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Tom and Mi

504
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
are 14 months apart.

505
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,040
So many doctors advised me

506
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,800
not to keep this.

507
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,720
But of course I want to keep it.

508
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,560
Because I think if I have one,

509
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,480
The only problem I was worried about

510
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,840
is that my body

511
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,200
enough support and nutrition to Tom.

512
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,640
The little house's siblings will be revealed.

513
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,800
My daughter is very kind.

514
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,160
She has a rich world.

515
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,600
When she was young, she could take care of seven kinds of animals at the same time.

516
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
And she has many books.

517
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,760
Just find a bird

518
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
find a bird

519
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,440
she can tell you

520
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,120
the name of this bird.

521
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,480
What's his academic name?

522
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,760
For example, on TV,

523
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,920
I saw her saying, "How about the fish?"

524
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
she immediately told me ten minutes.

525
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
She is very observant

526
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
and soft-hearted.

527
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,800
She's quite introverted and shy.

528
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,960
Actually, I've thought about

529
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
what she would say

530
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,560
what she will say.

531
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
But what she said today

532
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,080
what she said today.

533
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,760
There's a kind of bird outside.

534
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
If you point it to Xiaoling,

535
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,040
she'll know the scientific name of the bird.

536
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,240
She actually remembers all these details.

537
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
It's just that she doesn't usually say it.

538
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,720
When she mentioned this today,

539
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,680
I couldn't do it.

540
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,120
I feel my mom

541
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,520
still paying attention to me.

542
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,840
My son is a very serious person.

543
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,640
but he's reliable.

544
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,920
Many things

545
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,760
about many things.

546
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
As long as he agrees to do it, he will definitely do it.

547
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm quite surprised.

548
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,800
Maybe she doesn't acknowledge me.

549
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,480
We don't usually communicate like this.

550
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,320
When she describes me,

551
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,000
she was proud and proud.

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm actually quite happy.

553
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,280
What about Tom?

554
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,040
It's more strict

555
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,200
will be more strict.

556
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,160
That's why

557
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,800
they are so good now.

558
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
I can feel that

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
a very strict mother.

560
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,440
I can relate to her.

561
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,840
But I think

562
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,560
they might be more strict.

563
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:07,600
Show us your siblings.

564
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Wait.

565
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
I have a sister and a younger brother.

566
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,160
The four of us

567
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:26,560
The siblings of our house are revealed.

568
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,440
The first ambassador.

569
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,320
It's obvious.

570
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,160
I didn't become an ambassador.

571
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,520
They're disappointed.

572
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,400
I don't think

573
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,720
it's very valuable to me.

574
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,320
You gave up those things.

575
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,640
But how many kids do you have?

576
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,280
He may cause you a lot of trouble,

577
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,600
but they change every day.

578
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
He is continuous.

579
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,920
So he may be

580
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
more proud of him.

581
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
Show your siblings.

582
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,360
So beautiful.

583
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,680
Parents have an expiration date.

584
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,080
That makes sense.

585
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,960
So it's better these years.

586
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,800
Because they are all grown up.

587
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,080
When they were young,

588
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,360
they didn't have

589
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
to relax.

590
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
Tell them I'm going to entertain.

591
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:17,120
Show your siblings.

592
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
I got goose bumps.

593
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,800
She probably gave up a lot for us.

594
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,120
But she...

595
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,000
For so many years,

596
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,520
for so many years.

597
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,840
My mom is very strong.

598
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,520
I think

599
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,320
to do

600
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,360
meaningful to society.

601
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,960
a passionate career woman.

602
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,880
When she comes back to her family,

603
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
her dream and ambition

604
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
can only depend on the children.

605
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,240
The pressure I didn't understand before

606
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,440
I think I can understand it now.

607
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
Because this effort

608
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
is really huge.

609
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
So I think

610
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
I need to do more.

611
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,640
to match

612
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,360
to her.

613
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,680
She will discuss it in private.

614
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,280
But we

615
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
show it in front of my mom.

616
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,040
Actually,

617
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I didn't say anything close to my mom.

618
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,160
Because I always think

619
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
when I get close to her,

620
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,800
I feel a little nervous.

621
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,320
or I want to show

622
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,240
my best side.

623
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Since I have memories,

624
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,280
I've accepted

625
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,640
accept

626
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,200
everything she gave me.

627
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,160
So what I want to say now is

628
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Thank you.

629
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,320
Thank you.

630
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
It's really hard.

631
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
and sensible.

632
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,560
I want to tell my mom

633
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,760
your siblings.

634
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
Although you are very strict,

635
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
and fierce sometimes,

636
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
But I know

637
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,240
it shows that you love us.

638
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,960
You care about us.

639
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Maybe you want us to do our best.

640
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,720
so that we can

641
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,680
to support ourselves

642
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,280
and help her family.

643
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,200
And thank her.

644
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,400
Thank you for your hard work.

645
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,600
I think for girls,

646
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,120
I hope you can marry love.

647
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
But I hope

648
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,960
I hope to find

649
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
a soul mate.

650
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
OK. Come on.

651
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,880
Let me introduce.

652
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm Brandis.

653
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,800
And my Chinese name is Cao Xiaoling.

654
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,280
Cao Xiaoling.

655
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,560
Mimi.

656
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:29,920
Mimi.

657
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,680
Vegetable.

658
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
Mi Zi.

659
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,200
I remember, Mi Zi.

660
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,920
You call me every time.

661
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Mimi.

662
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,520
Where is she?

663
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
So every time you call the kitten

664
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
in the small house,

665
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,320
I...

666
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,320
I'm Tom.

667
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
And...

668
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay.

669
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,040
What's your name?

670
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,200
Only my sister and I have Cao's name.

671
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,680
He and my little brother don't have one.

672
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,640
Surprised?

673
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,600
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang.

674
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,520
They all guessed it.

675
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Is it our turn?

676
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I think the probability

677
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,160
That was the right time.

678
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
I had a good condition.

679
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,120
I plan to have a second child.

680
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,320
Oh no.

681
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,680
When I was pregnant with my sister,

682
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,360
the others always teased me.

683
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
He said your mom will have a sister.

684
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
Sister?

685
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,840
When my mom's voice came out,

686
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,800
I couldn't control my emotions.

687
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
It feels familiar

688
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,680
and listening on the big screen.

689
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
I don't know how to describe it.

690
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,440
I'm He Wenxin, He Wenjie's father.

691
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,720
He Wenxin.

692
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,080
He Wenjie

693
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,440
He Wenxin.

694
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,400
He Wenxin was fat when she was young.

695
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
I hoped she was a girl.

696
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Later she was born a girl

697
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,240
I was very happy.

698
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,480
The siblings of the house were made public.

699
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
(The two of them have nothing to say.)

700
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,480
Whether they have a boyfriend

701
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,240
or a girlfriend,

702
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
we'll tell each other

703
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,320
Both of them.

704
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,600
We didn't know.

705
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,760
You and your sister are very close.

706
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
In the interview,

707
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,280
Xinxin has a boyfriend.

708
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,240
she would tell Fatty

709
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,040
Fatty would also tell Xinxin

710
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
So they are

711
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,280
They are a fusion.

712
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,720
It's just

713
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,360
two different people.

714
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,600
more like friends.

715
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
So I think

716
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,280
this is a new

717
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,840
I don't know.

718
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,480
Both children were cheerful when they were young.

719
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,680
The siblings were disclosed

720
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,960
At that time,

721
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,400
Dad only talked to me.

722
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,160
And before I went abroad.

723
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
Back then,

724
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,840
I hid a lot of thoughts.

725
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
If I went back to that time,

726
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,680
I might not have done that.

727
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,240
I might try my best.

728
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,920
Even if the result won't change

729
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,160
When the siblings are revealed,

730
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,640
When my parents separated,

731
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,360
she was rebellious.

732
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,080
Her personality changed suddenly.

733
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,000
The siblings of the house are disclosed.

734
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Actually, my personality changed a lot

735
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,840
because of this.

736
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,360
He has indeed become stubborn.

737
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,480
and persistent.

738
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't like to communicate.

739
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
With my parents.

740
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,080
Because of this,

741
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,440
because of this.

742
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,080
Because of this,

743
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
because of this.

744
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,680
But I think

745
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,880
everything is the best arrangement.

746
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,200
Don't dwell on the past.

747
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
We've finally figured it out.

748
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,760
When she went to Singapore to study,

749
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,080
she asked me to go with her.

750
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,880
I'll go then.

751
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
I didn't pass the exam.

752
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm back.

753
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,800
Her siblings were revealed.

754
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,280
She must have been looking forward

755
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,320
to study with her.

756
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,480
I think his changes

757
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,840
is very obvious.

758
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,880
Because I went abroad for a few years.

759
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,080
and he stopped accompanying me.

760
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,840
After I came back,

761
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,280
he's taking care of others.

762
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,320
They are together every day.

763
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,280
How can I be at ease when He Wenxin is outside?

764
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,360
Because Fatty saw it.

765
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,840
But because

766
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
my dad has high expectations of me.

767
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,720
His discipline and education

768
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,880
gradually

769
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,800
through my brother.

770
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,280
So my brother

771
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
for me.

772
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,160
Only two people in my family care about me like this.

773
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm an adult now.

774
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,160
I might go home late.

775
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,360
Maybe the next day, my brother would scold me.

776
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,960
I feel like

777
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,040
being protected.

778
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,120
and a little annoyed.

779
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
When I was driving in 2016,

780
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,360
when I was driving in 2016.

781
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,360
I was not

782
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,240
hurt.

783
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
But the car was badly damaged.

784
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,560
I didn't think

785
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,520
there was something wrong.

786
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,840
The next day, I received a long text

787
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,480
a long text message.

788
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,760
I was a little confused when I saw that text.

789
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,640
At that moment,

790
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,960
I wanted to cry at that time.

791
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,480
I didn't expect

792
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,240
my brother would think so much for me.

793
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,160
First, I'm worried about my personal safety.

794
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Second, she was worried

795
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,000
because I was

796
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,280
when I was young?

797
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,760
Did you encounter

798
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,080
or something bad?

799
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,360
I called her back then.

800
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,800
When I called her back,

801
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,280
she was still choking.

802
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,240
So at that moment,

803
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,840
I knew she cried.

804
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,080
I was really touched.

805
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,960
If she is bullied in love,

806
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,600
I will stand out immediately.

807
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,840
As for their relationship,

808
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,920
I won't interfere in other things.

809
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,120
But I just can't see

810
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,520
my brother being bullied.

811
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,280
he will...

812
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
He gets involved in everything.

813
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,840
He's very involved.

814
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,560
The three are talking.

815
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,960
Three people.

816
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,760
This description

817
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,480
The three of them are dating.

818
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,760
That's funny.

819
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
Xinxin.

820
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,480
The siblings in the small house

821
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,720
and build your own family.

822
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,120
I wish you all the best.

823
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,600
Come on.

824
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,160
Bless her.

825
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
Come on.

826
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,760
Fatty, try to find yourself.

827
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,320
the girl you love.

828
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,960
Take good care of girls.

829
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
Let your career

830
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
to the public.

831
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm so touched.

832
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,480
This part

833
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,400
Not bad.

834
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,280
Xinxin is beautiful.

835
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,600
Yes.

836
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,080
Let me introduce.

837
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,800
Hello, I'm He Wenxin.

838
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
He is He Wenjie.

839
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm the elder brother.

840
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:44,880
Yes.

841
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,400
He's older.

842
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,040
I'm your sister.

843
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,640
The little house's siblings are revealed.

844
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,080
I love recording his

845
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,280
Show your siblings.

846
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,160
When did this happen?

847
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,120
He kissed me cute when I was young.

848
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,360
Bye, Sister Wang.

849
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,560
I'll miss you.

850
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,640
Show us your siblings.

851
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,160
When you were young,

852
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Now that you've grown up,

853
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
I didn't expect

854
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,680
to be so clingy

855
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
like this.

856
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
When I saw the map,

857
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
Those videos

858
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
This kind of video

859
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,200
I think

860
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,320
it's good to have such a brother.

861
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,240
I think childhood will be very happy

862
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,080
and happy.

863
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,360
We are

864
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,920
a family

865
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
a family.

866
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,880
The little house's siblings were revealed.

867
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,120
I was quite surprised.

868
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,720
Because I didn't expect

869
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,600
they would be a family.

870
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
First, I know they are siblings.

871
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,480
But I didn't know they were half-siblings.

872
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,120
I felt sorry for them.

873
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,560
Then I went to Guangzhou.

874
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,000
When I left Ze,

875
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
the siblings will be revealed.

876
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Mom.

877
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I want my mom.

878
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,320
My siblings will be revealed.

879
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
This scene

880
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,400
has always been in my heart.

881
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,200
The siblings in the small house are revealed.

882
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,240
I don't remember seeing my mom cry.
The siblings in the small house are revealed.

883
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,480
I don't remember seeing my mom cry.

884
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,960
I didn't expect her

885
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,920
so sad.

886
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,240
Yes.

887
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Because in my memory,

888
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,200
my mom has always been

889
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,640
She's always very cheerful.

890
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,800
I think everything can be over.

891
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:46,960
Yes.

892
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
So when I saw her cry,

893
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,480
I couldn't help it.

894
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,880
I'd rather she didn't record this.

895
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,440
I don't want her to cry when she remembers the past.

896
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,800
Don't cry.

897
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,640
(I'll call my mom)

898
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,480
I'll call my mom.

899
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,240
I can't get through.

900
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Because the person who called my phone in Guangzhou

901
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,639
I have to add a zero to get through.

902
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,360
My mom didn't tell her that zero.

903
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,320
I felt guilty

904
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,800
I feel guilty.

905
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,400
I feel sorry for her.

906
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,120
Yes.

907
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,520
I feel so sorry for her.

908
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,880
I missed a lot.

909
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,199
Hua called her

910
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,400
She can never get through.

911
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm going to cry.

912
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,120
I can't imagine my life without my mom.

913
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,400
It's okay.

914
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,920
I just realized

915
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,680
I missed a zero.

916
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,280
Now I know

917
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,240
regret.

918
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,000
I think it's better not to let her know.

919
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
That's even worse.

920
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
Right.

921
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,400
Even if my business is good or bad,

922
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,920
she just cares about your health.

923
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,960
Are you tired?

924
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,120
Are you happy?

925
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,360
Hua's sensibility touched me.

926
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,480
It's true that a little girl

927
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,880
That was the most touching.

928
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,040
I can understand that

929
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,240
in the small house.

930
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,880
and taking care of everyone.

931
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,120
Tae-seo.

932
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,280
It's not spicy. It's good. It's good. It's good.

933
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,360
It's not spicy.

934
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,000
But I think she wants someone

935
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,840
someone to take care of her.

936
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,440
After all, in this growth environment,

937
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
she must lack love.

938
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,160
I think she doesn't feel secure.

939
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,560
But she pretended to feel safe.

940
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,360
Tae-seo, I'm on your side.

941
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,040
You know her.

942
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,120
Hello, everyone.

943
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm Yu's mom.

944
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,200
and Xiaomei's mother.

945
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,400
Yu's dad was my first love.

946
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,640
I was with him in my twenties.

947
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,000
When Yu was a year old,

948
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
he was sick.

949
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,720
Yes.

950
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,320
We saw this before, right?

951
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,600
Yes.

952
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,240
I want to cry every time I see him.

953
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,440
He passed away when I was four.

954
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,200
To me,

955
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,360
I felt like my world had collapsed.

956
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,040
He didn't tell me much.

957
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,320
He didn't tell me in language.

958
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,320
What do you want?

959
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,000
One time when I went hiking,

960
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,520
he only asked me

961
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,680
Will you remarry?

962
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,480
If my siblings were revealed,

963
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,680
I didn't know

964
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,520
how to answer him.

965
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,720
If I told him I wouldn't remarry,

966
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,280
he might think it's not real.

967
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,240
He didn't believe it either.

968
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,040
But I said I would remarry.

969
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,160
He must be in pain.

970
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
He might not be able to leave in peace.

971
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,680
This is the only language he gave me.

972
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,520
It means

973
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,400
in his will,

974
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
he still trusts me.

975
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,920
I think I will carry on his responsibility.

976
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,640
I can feel

977
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,880
he gave me.

978
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,440
I haven't let go of this relationship.

979
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,600
My love for him

980
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,360
to the child.

981
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,720
The little house's siblings will be revealed.

982
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,440
So small.

983
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,760
When Tu was four years old,

984
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
his father passed away.

985
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,840
I feel sorry for him.

986
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,720
But when I grew up,

987
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
when I was the most frustrated,

988
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,320
is not because of physical strength.

989
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,600
When kids

990
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,560
he doesn't listen to me,

991
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,160
I would think

992
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,480
I could beat him up if my dad was here.

993
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,960
Actually, when the kid is good,

994
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
I thought

995
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,240
I want to share this joy with others.

996
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,680
But no one shared it.

997
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,040
Yes.

998
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Show us your siblings.

999
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,080
Son.

1000
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,280
Son.

1001
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,240
But when I was young,

1002
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,360
I remember it clearly once.

1003
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,120
In a painting class,

1004
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,200
the teacher asked us to draw family members.

1005
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
But I really don't know why

1006
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
I didn't draw my mother.

1007
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,960
or siblings.

1008
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,040
I didn't draw anything.

1009
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
I only drew my dad.

1010
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,480
I remember

1011
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
there was a moon on my painting.

1012
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,640
He stood on a balcony

1013
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,680
watching the moon with me.

1014
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,640
I thought about him.

1015
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,080
So I drew him out like this.

1016
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,120
and carved it.

1017
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,560
Maybe it's a thought from my childhood.

1018
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,880
Yes.

1019
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,760
Isn't this a romance show?

1020
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,520
What are you doing?

1021
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,440
I was tortured by my family.

1022
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,800
When I shaved my head and had chemotherapy,

1023
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,080
and lying in the hospital bed.

1024
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
That was my last impression of my dad.

1025
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,120
I miss him.

1026
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,640
I didn't expect

1027
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,280
in the video

1028
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,200
in the video.

1029
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,920
So I

1030
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,400
I might not have the chance

1031
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,800
to call my name again.

1032
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:19,040
The siblings of the house will be revealed.

1033
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
Actually I once thought

1034
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
to find a dad for him.

1035
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,920
But I found

1036
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,560
I still think it's inappropriate.

1037
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
Maybe

1038
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
someone else's father

1039
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,920
or

1040
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,280
not his own father.

1041
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,640
He can never replace this role.

1042
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,640
Gradually, I still

1043
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,880
by myself.

1044
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,560
She keeps asking me

1045
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,120
why don’t you find someone

1046
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,240
When I was a teenager,

1047
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,840
I found a younger brother for me.

1048
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
I said I don't want to.

1049
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
I only love you.

1050
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,320
I don't want to share this love with others.

1051
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,600
I only love you.

1052
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,360
I think after my dad passed away,

1053
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,640
there's more than one person

1054
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,440
is not just one person.

1055
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,680
My mom.

1056
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,320
my brother,

1057
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,440
and my brother's mother.

1058
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,160
I don't know.

1059
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
Both mothers

1060
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,280
are great.

1061
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,440
Because

1062
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,720
they have to

1063
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,480
to take care of two children.

1064
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,560
and keep a good family.

1065
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,960
and raised both of them well.

1066
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,280
And the drawing and Huahua

1067
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
are very good.

1068
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,120
I think Tu Tu

1069
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,080
can accept this child.

1070
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,880
Flowers can also

1071
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,720
Their love

1072
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,200
really touched me.

1073
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,840
the efforts of my parents.

1074
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,000
That kind of love is indeed

1075
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,840
is that

1076
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,520
sitting there makes you feel touched.

1077
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,080
That's why you feel that it's not easy for your parents.

1078
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,720
They haven't kissed me since they grew up.

1079
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,560
Just one kiss now.

1080
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,240
Yes.

1081
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,680
Walk over.

1082
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:22,960
Kiss.

1083
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,600
Let me do it.

1084
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,760
The map is great.

1085
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,520
I can't do it anymore.

1086
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,040
I think drawing and flowers

1087
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,800
are best at expressing love.

1088
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,000
They want each other to know

1089
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,400
he's being loved.

1090
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,920
and making up for

1091
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,280
each other's missing father's love.

1092
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,280
In fact, I think

1093
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,080
like this,

1094
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,880
I can't do better than her.

1095
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,320
I think Hua is

1096
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,800
that I really want to make.

1097
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,040
And I hope

1098
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,320
he would try harder to protect you.

1099
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,880
Let me introduce.

1100
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm Tu.

1101
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,040
My full name is Wang Jiu.

1102
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm Tsu from the universe.

1103
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,080
I'm Hua Hua.

1104
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,280
I'm Wang Yin-tong.

1105
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,240
The silver of the bank, the calcium of three o'clock water.

1106
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,160
So you just named the map.

1107
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,120
The map is based on

1108
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,160
characteristics.

1109
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
His ears are big.

1110
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,640
So if you like it, we'll call you Tu.

1111
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,840
or Yu?

1112
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,440
It's called Tu.

1113
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
He likes drawing.

1114
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,640
Okay, I'll call you Tu.

1115
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
Although

1116
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,800
the atmosphere of the video

1117
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,000
a little bit

1118
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,600
a little heavy.

1119
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,160
Why is it so serious every time it's our turn?

1120
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,280
Yeah, but actually we...

1121
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,440
You really can't see it.

1122
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,120
we are very positive in daily life.

1123
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,720
We won't cry about anything.

1124
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,240
Solve it on the day when something happens.

1125
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,560
And it never consumes internal energy.

1126
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,280
You can kick him

1127
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,720
in every corner.

1128
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,920
It's wrapped.

1129
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,320
It's true that we haven't noticed it for so many days.

1130
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,480
Neither did I.

1131
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,320
I just found out.

1132
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,120
Isn't this my sister?

1133
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes.

1134
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,640
Everyone thinks we are siblings

1135
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,400
Actually both moms are great

1136
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,760
Both moms have experienced

1137
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,880
of life.

1138
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,760
But they didn't

1139
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,280
on the children.

1140
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,040
They have endured a lot

1141
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,440
their loneliness.

1142
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,360
Or maybe

1143
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,840
I miss my lost partner.

1144
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,240
But their love

1145
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,160
is not that heavy.

1146
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,920
but also let them grow freely.

1147
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,320
I think this experience

1148
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,760
may be painful

1149
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,200
his childhood must be painful.

1150
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,320
But you look at the picture so cheerful now.

1151
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,800
and optimistic.

1152
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,560
I can imagine

1153
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,080
how much mom has done

1154
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,120
to make a boy

1155
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,600
to be so optimistic

1156
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,880
after such a sad process.

1157
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,840
The brighter they are, the more you think about them.

1158
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,880
the more you care about them.

1159
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,320
Yes.

1160
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,160
When I smile at the picture,

1161
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,440
I want to cry.

1162
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,720
But I don't know.

1163
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,280
I've been thinking about something.

1164
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,640
I think

1165
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,920
if a woman chooses to be a mother,

1166
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,560
how many things

1167
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,360
How many things is she going to give up?

1168
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,120
Xiao Ling and Tom's mother

1169
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,160
are those who have a bright future.

1170
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,920
Because she chose to become a mother,

1171
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,360
she had to give up her career.

1172
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,520
Hua's mother,

1173
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
and a map.

1174
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,480
Actually

1175
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,280
They all think they need to give all their love to their children.

1176
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,960
So,

1177
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,400
For example, in a intimate relationship,

1178
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,280
they choose to

1179
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,160
to spend the rest of their time alone.

1180
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,120
Most women

1181
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,120
make a huge sacrifice.

1182
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,520
In a normal family,

1183
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,240
in a normal family

1184
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,640
my mom stopped working.

1185
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,840
I feel like I don't have any father.

1186
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,680
In this,

1187
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,880
are not considered equally.

1188
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,360
Even many girls

1189
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,240
without hesitation.

1190
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,040
I'll take the responsibility first.

1191
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,840
I think it should be me.

1192
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,640
It's me.

1193
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,040
Yes.

1194
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,000
Now many moms

1195
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
want to

1196
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,000
to be a good mom.

1197
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,760
We have defined

1198
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,760
a little defined.

1199
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,320
Yes.

1200
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,680
But mom can be different

1201
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,800
is different.

1202
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Like you said,

1203
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,920
we should do

1204
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,600
what we want to be.

1205
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,120
Don't look at

1206
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,120
what good moms look like.

1207
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,600
Actually, Xiaoling's mom

1208
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,120
I was really touched by something.

1209
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,640
She said we have an expiration date as parents.

1210
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,120
In fact, everyone's life

1211
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,640
has an expiration date.

1212
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,120
Who do we choose to spend time with

1213
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,840
to spend time with.

1214
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,440
So maybe we chose

1215
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,200
how to understand the word love.

1216
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,440
In your eyes,

1217
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,680
in your eyes.

1218
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,400
If each of us

1219
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,840
in one word,

1220
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,360
I think my mom looks like

1221
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,800
I think she's like Cappipala.

1222
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,760
Kapipala (papapa).

1223
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,800
Relax.

1224
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,400
Because she is very relaxed.

1225
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,840
Other moms may ask for your career

1226
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,080
your study,

1227
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,560
your views and growth.

1228
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,680
My mom thinks it's good that you're alive.

1229
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,400
She always calls and asks you

1230
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,440
where I'm going recently.

1231
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,280
Can you contact her for me?

1232
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,200
She cares about her experience.

1233
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,800
So I was relaxed.

1234
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,960
Actually my mom is the other mom

1235
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
other moms.

1236
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,760
My mom spent her whole life

1237
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,560
all her energy was on me.

1238
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,000
She always said

1239
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,160
as long as I live well,

1240
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,760
she's fine.

1241
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
I feel stressed.

1242
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
I feel very sad.

1243
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,600
I really hope my mom

1244
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,760
her hobbies.

1245
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,280
or hobbies,

1246
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,680
I can give you my full support.

1247
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,760
I just hope she has a hobby.

1248
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,600
I'm struggling inside.

1249
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,760
So I was thinking

1250
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,000
what my mom looks like.

1251
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,200
Soybeans.

1252
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,800
Why?

1253
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,720
Because yellow beans are all-rounder.

1254
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,160
It can become soy milk

1255
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,320
and tofu.

1256
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,120
You can grow bean sprouts in the water

1257
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,480
People would think

1258
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
you have such a mom.

1259
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,240
I think my mom

1260
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,160
because she loves me.

1261
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,240
So she's willing to sacrifice herself

1262
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,680
to become like this.

1263
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,040
But because I love my mom too,

1264
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,520
So I hope she can be

1265
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,040
a happy bean.

1266
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,600
Just be her.

1267
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,760
She doesn't need me to change so much.

1268
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,440
Because I think I've grown up.

1269
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,320
In my imagination,

1270
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,760
in a family relationship,

1271
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
I'm more like

1272
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,080
a cloud

1273
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,840
when you need her.

1274
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,480
Yes.

1275
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,240
If dad is the one in the sky

1276
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,120
in the sky,

1277
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,080
It's too hot.

1278
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,800
or when you

1279
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,160
to grow rapidly,

1280
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,560
my mom will show up in time

1281
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,080
you need some rain.

1282
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,240
And she will rain in time.

1283
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,680
My mom is icloud.

1284
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,160
Yes.

1285
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,080
Right.

1286
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,920
I think my mom

1287
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,640
an angel like me.

1288
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,000
Yes.

1289
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,440
Because when I was 23,

1290
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,000
when I was 23.

1291
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,480
She had cancer.

1292
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,640
So at that time,

1293
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,240
I was watching that clip.

1294
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,520
I'm very touched

1295
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,680
when their father passed away,

1296
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,480
Because to me,

1297
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,120
I don't think

1298
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,120
in life.

1299
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,320
I'm not afraid of

1300
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,880
to me.

1301
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,920
What I fear most is death and death.

1302
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,200
Yes.

1303
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,000
But when my mom left,

1304
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,640
she really gave me

1305
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,680
that changed me.

1306
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,080
Yes, my mom is also

1307
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,840
Superman mom.

1308
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,040
Yes.

1309
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,320
She's willing to sacrifice everything for our family.

1310
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,400
She even got cancer.

1311
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,640
she didn't tell us.

1312
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,720
She's suffering.

1313
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,240
She's carrying it with my dad.

1314
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,200
Because she was afraid that I would come back

1315
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,880
so she came back.

1316
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,200
Yes.

1317
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,480
When I graduated,

1318
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,560
she told us she had cancer.

1319
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,960
Then there were only seven or eight months left.

1320
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,360
So...

1321
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,480
I was very sad at that moment.

1322
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,520
But because of this,

1323
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,160
she makes me stronger.

1324
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,160
Yes.

1325
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,760
She makes me brave

1326
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,280
I try it bravely.

1327
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,280
Because I'm not afraid of failure.

1328
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,160
Because I think

1329
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,440
the hardest moment in my life has passed.

1330
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,040
Yes.

1331
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,920
So the spirit she gave me

1332
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,640
that changed my life.

1333
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,600
Yeah. And I cherish every day.

1334
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,760
Because we don't know

1335
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,520
what will happen tomorrow.

1336
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,080
I hope every day

1337
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
I can live without regret.

1338
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,760
Remember this.

1339
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,720
Don't mention my mom.

1340
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,600
It'll collapse.

1341
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,680
Whenever Dan thinks of this,

1342
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,160
when she thinks about this.

1343
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,920
Because my mom suffered so much.

1344
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,520
Just like Tu and the others.

1345
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,040
My dad got sick when I was born.

1346
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,600
My dad passed away when I was seven.

1347
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,760
And my dad never hugged me.

1348
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,680
Because he had TB at that time.

1349
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,600
Yes.

1350
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,640
In your consciousness,

1351
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,600
it's contagious.

1352
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,840
So my mom has to take care of my dad

1353
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,480
She could only send me away.

1354
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,400
Then she came to see me

1355
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,360
for a year.

1356
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,800
and look at me and my grandma.

1357
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,280
Then my mom cried and left.

1358
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,960
My mom was

1359
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,720
an ordinary spinning worker.

1360
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,880
in a textile factory.

1361
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,360
and my dad.

1362
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,680
After I was born,

1363
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,080
my dad got worse,

1364
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,520
she could only give me to my grandma.

1365
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,320
So she suffered a lot alone.

1366
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,200
Yes, that's the pain.

1367
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,360
I can't understand it.

1368
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,960
After my dad passed away,

1369
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,600
my family would say,

1370
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,520
how about you adopt the child to us?

1371
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,600
You're a woman.

1372
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,760
all your money.

1373
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,520
Treat my dad.

1374
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,640
You live on your own.

1375
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,480
But my mom said I don't care.

1376
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,240
I'm a beggar.

1377
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,040
I have to take care of this child.

1378
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,160
So in my heart,

1379
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,280
my mom is my home.

1380
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,320
She is my roof.

1381
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,600
I can't imagine

1382
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,880
my mom is not in my life.

1383
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,760
What will happen to me?

1384
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,760
I mean it. She is my everything.

1385
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,880
She is everything to me.

1386
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,280
I can't lose my mom.

1387
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,200
I can't imagine

1388
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,360
the farewell.

1389
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,240
I dare not think about it.

1390
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,200
I don't want to talk anymore.

1391
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,720
I think my mom's image

1392
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,400
a butter bear.

1393
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,960
There's a small pocket of Doraemon.

1394
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,040
a butter bear.

1395
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,520
My mom is fat.

1396
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,080
She looks very cute

1397
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,800
He smiles at everyone.

1398
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,480
Now that I think about it,

1399
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,880
I think my mom

1400
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,200
in her life.

1401
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,560
The growth of Chinese women in their generation

1402
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,720
my mom

1403
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,200
is very ambitious.

1404
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,520
When everyone was doing farm work,

1405
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,560
she thought I might make some money

1406
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,200
to make some money.

1407
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,760
Then I set up a stall.

1408
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,080
Then there was a small shop.

1409
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,640
The business income was not bad.

1410
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,520
But because of the changes of my dad's work opportunities,

1411
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,120
in this family,

1412
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,560
should focus on people with stable jobs.

1413
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,760
So my mom stopped running the store

1414
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,120
I followed my dad to different towns.

1415
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,600
to work.

1416
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,280
Then I went to do cleaning

1417
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,080
to cook for others

1418
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,280
So it's very typical

1419
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,400
who has been sacrificing her whole life.

1420
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,600
It's hard for you not to empathize.

1421
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,360
their experience.

1422
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,280
she has been very kind

1423
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,240
and cute.

1424
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,400
But sometimes you feel

1425
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,960
your mom is like

1426
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,360
who is

1427
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,800
who are doing this job.

1428
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,920
But they seldom tell us

1429
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,720
every day they worked hard to support.

1430
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,280
I'm tired of crying today.

1431
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,720
So we have to treat them well.

1432
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,680
You have to sacrifice too.

1433
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,960
Yes.

1434
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,560
Yes.

1435
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,800
It seems that we have a lot of

1436
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,960
in our past.

1437
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,600
is already an objective fact.

1438
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,160
It has already happened.

1439
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,920
First, you treat your past

1440
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,720
as a gift.

1441
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,320
Second,

1442
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,040
if you have missed the afterlight of the sunset,

1443
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,320
don't blame yourself and regret

1444
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,320
and miss another starry sky.

1445
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,880
Live in the moment.

1446
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,800
and love the people around you.

1447
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,920
Just like one of them said,

1448
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,800
everything is the best arrangement.

1449
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,640
right?

1450
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,560
This is very important.

1451
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,280
Just look forward.

1452
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,200
Show your siblings.

1453
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Tata.

1454
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:14,920
(Tata)

1455
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,120
Tata.

1456
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,200
So cute.

1457
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,000
This hair

1458
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,360
is so cute.

1459
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,720
You've had this hairstyle since you were a kid.

1460
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,000
Show your siblings.

1461
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,680
It's so photogenic.

1462
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,320
We planned to get the second one

1463
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,800
I'm a little shy to see it.

1464
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,200
And I suddenly thought of my childhood.

1465
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,400
I would ask

1466
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,120
who gave birth to me.

1467
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,360
I was curious.

1468
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,440
Dad told me

1469
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,680
he said that the whole family

1470
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,760
My dad was the only one who wanted me to stay.

1471
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
It's indeed because I gave birth to my brother.

1472
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,080
It's only been two years.

1473
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,400
But my dad insists that

1474
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,840
I should be born.

1475
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,240
Since I was young,

1476
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,120
Dad's scale

1477
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,000
is leaning towards me.

1478
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,360
I think my dad really loves me.

1479
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,360
The siblings of the house are revealed.

1480
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:11,800
My name is Tata.

1481
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,640
Rollin.

1482
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,720
When I was a sophomore,

1483
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,240
my brothers took me into the industry

1484
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,560
and started to be a model.

1485
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,640
Very handsome.

1486
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,120
Hello, everyone.

1487
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
My name is Kai.

1488
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,040
This is my brother.

1489
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,440
So handsome.

1490
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,160
So handsome.

1491
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,040
I can't speak.

1492
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,240
I dare not say it's so cool.

1493
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,080
You're finally here.

1494
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,000
He looks a bit like you.

1495
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,440
He looks like you.

1496
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,640
Really.

1497
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,280
She's a group pet

1498
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,840
She grew up with the care and care of her family

1499
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,160
He was a good student

1500
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,680
He loves pets a lot.

1501
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,800
Having a daughter

1502
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,240
About five hours

1503
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,880
about five hours.

1504
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,600
About four or five hours.

1505
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,360
Because there was a power outage.

1506
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,280
Then our comrades just said

1507
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,840
to call her a blackout.

1508
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,040
A blackout?

1509
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,880
Your siblings are revealed.

1510
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:09,920
Tata was really cute when he was young.
Your siblings are revealed.

1511
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,840
Tata was really cute when he was young.

1512
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,280
She's so stylish.

1513
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,160
My daughter is very beautiful.

1514
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,760
and lovely little girl.

1515
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,440
So small.

1516
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,960
So cute.

1517
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,800
In other people's eyes,

1518
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,680
they are all very polite.

1519
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,360
Just like now

1520
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,400
So cute

1521
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,720
They say

1522
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,120
they are the best dish

1523
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,480
The best dish.

1524
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,720
The most beautiful dish.

1525
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,560
That's what it means.

1526
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,400
When he said that,

1527
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,080
I couldn't believe it.

1528
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,240
My dad said that.

1529
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,360
To be honest,

1530
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,520
I put a lot of love and emotions

1531
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,720
in my heart.

1532
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,320
The siblings of the house will be disclosed.

1533
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,720
The money they earned

1534
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,400
secretly changed a car for me.

1535
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,120
It makes me proud.

1536
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,560
The little house's siblings are public.

1537
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,440
Show your siblings.

1538
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,200
I think good love is

1539
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,440
tolerate each other

1540
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,160
and help each other.

1541
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,400
and accompany each other.

1542
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,680
Dad will change himself because of his mom.

1543
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,120
I think this is a rare point.

1544
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,240
It will still affect

1545
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,080
on our love view.

1546
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,800
Daughter,

1547
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,080
You have the courage to pursue your own life.

1548
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,040
We are here.

1549
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,520
are your strong support.

1550
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,280
Come on.

1551
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,240
A loving family.

1552
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,680
Harry wants to cheer for me.

1553
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,560
Come on.

1554
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,360
To be honest,

1555
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,560
I envy Tata's family the most.

1556
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,320
I just feel

1557
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,080
has been well protected since childhood.

1558
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,000
Her dad and her mom

1559
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,280
is also good.

1560
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,360
A living environment since childhood

1561
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,000
should be very happy

1562
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,400
a carefree childhood.

1563
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,840
the happiest family.

1564
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,600
I think it's Tata's family.

1565
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,400
Both of them are very relaxed

1566
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,520
and make jokes.

1567
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,120
No matter how old you are

1568
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,000
Keep it up.

1569
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,200
Okay.

1570
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,760
Let me introduce. I'm Rollin.

1571
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,840
I have a brother called Lo Ling Kai.

1572
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,440
We've actually

1573
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,080
recorded these interviews together.

1574
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
But later,

1575
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,920
when he was about to come in,

1576
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,560
he couldn't come

1577
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,120
because of work.

1578
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,560
I came alone in the end.

1579
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,680
Tata, we have brothers and sisters.

1580
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,160
Are you lonely now?

1581
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,480
I'm so sad.

1582
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,720
I cried.

1583
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,640
When my brother didn't come,

1584
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,800
I cried right away.

1585
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,320
So fragile?

1586
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,520
I wanted him to accompany me.

1587
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
I might be better.

1588
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,600
But he didn't come.

1589
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,640
Then I came up alone.

1590
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,880
It's okay.

1591
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,440
It's okay.

1592
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,600
We're under a lot of pressure.

1593
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,440
Yeah, we're under a lot of pressure too.

1594
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,680
And...

1595
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,560
Definitely.

1596
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,440
All of you

1597
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,360
have siblings in the house.

1598
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,160
I feel lonely

1599
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,120
alone.

1600
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,320
Thinking about him is one thing.

1601
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,120
I actually resent him in my heart.

1602
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,360
I wondered why he didn't come.

1603
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,120
Then we can introduce each other.

1604
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,080
I won't say I'm alone.

1605
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,560
alone here.

1606
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,000
about someone who hasn't been here.

1607
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,920
Don't leave me alone next time.

1608
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,240
I'll be happy if I know my sister isn't here.

1609
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,440
No.

1610
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,880
I can't.

1611
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,080
I can be myself.

1612
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,640
I only have a fake brother.

1613
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,400
Cover my ears.

1614
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,320
I'll post it on Moments to scold Ling Kai.

1615
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,280
Can you play

1616
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,800
Play my real brother.

1617
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,400
Don't I look like one?

1618
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:39,760
Really?

1619
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,800
You said you would make me breakfast.

1620
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,640
I didn't have a meal.

1621
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,280
Me too.

1622
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,360
I'll eat flowers and Harry.

1623
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,280
I'll make it tomorrow.

1624
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,120
I'll cook for you too.

1625
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,840
Down

1626
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
It's so sweet.

1627
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,240
No, it's on the way.

1628
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,280
Do it for your sister.

1629
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,040
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

1630
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,400
We have two kids.

1631
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,000
One daughter and one son.

1632
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,280
They are outgoing.

1633
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,200
But Yuan Bo is more shy.

1634
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,240
Yuan Bo,

1635
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,680
I have a sister seven years older than me.

1636
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,760
She's a fashion stylist.

1637
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,840
Long time no see.

1638
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,360
Show us your siblings.

1639
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,160
Long time no see.

1640
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,280
I think brothers

1641
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,920
to me.

1642
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,200
who always stands behind me

1643
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:30,880
or when

1644
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,080
in the family,

1645
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,840
you'll be the first one

1646
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,760
to solve the problem.

1647
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,240
I like her so much.

1648
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:36,680
So cool.

1649
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,440
Yes.

1650
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,280
Maybe that's why

1651
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,360
I always call him Bobo.

1652
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,840
Yinbo.

1653
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,520
I have sisters and younger brothers.

1654
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,720
Very close

1655
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,960
We're always together.

1656
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,640
I think

1657
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,880
we can't do it.

1658
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,400
When I was young, I watched TV and grabbed the TV.

1659
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,680
and beat him up.

1660
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,760
The siblings of the house were revealed.

1661
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,240
Because my impression of my childhood

1662
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,080
when I was young.

1663
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,480
It's quite deep in my memory.

1664
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,280
Isn't that good?

1665
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,280
Otherwise, when you were young,

1666
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,200
when you were young.

1667
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,240
You should thank me.

1668
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,920
I should thank you for getting beaten up.

1669
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,000
You need to experience pain to grow up.

1670
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,000
Right?

1671
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,800
People who grew up under her control

1672
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,280
We often quarreled when we were kids.

1673
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,280
because she didn't want to spend her time

1674
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,480
on me.

1675
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,880
When I was young,

1676
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,360
all my attention was on you.

1677
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,280
So I think

1678
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,080
my love was separated.

1679
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,920
I wrote in my composition that my mom valued men over daughters.

1680
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,440
Writing?

1681
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,080
When my dad saw my composition,

1682
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,320
and the whole family read it.

1683
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
The siblings of the house will be disclosed.

1684
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,320
Because our family values men over women.

1685
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,040
And my sister

1686
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,600
my parents care more about me.

1687
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,160
She may dislike me.

1688
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,080
I may not have a brother.

1689
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,480
Maybe her parents

1690
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,680
on her.

1691
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,160
But my dad is fine in this aspect.

1692
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,520
I think my mom will be more serious.

1693
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,600
in all aspects.

1694
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,600
I think my stubbornness is my resistance to them.

1695
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:05,960
The siblings in the small house are disclosed.

1696
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,240
Go to Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou.

1697
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,240
to the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou.

1698
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,720
I've arranged high-speed rails all the way.

1699
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,560
She smiled at me on the top of the mountain

1700
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,280
"What are you going to do?"

1701
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,840
She said she was going to pray for you.

1702
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,440
I felt a huge gap.

1703
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,400
I didn't think about my daughter.

1704
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,320
She is

1705
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,720
being treated differently at home.

1706
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,960
Maybe

1707
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,080
when she was in college, she worked half-time,

1708
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,320
And she went to Shanghai alone.

1709
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,360
without any relatives

1710
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:40,960
or friends.

1711
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,320
She went alone.

1712
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:42,960
I think these moments

1713
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,800
these moments.

1714
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,960
I feel sorry for myself too.

1715
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,280
I'm about to cry.

1716
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,640
I owe my sister a lot.

1717
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,680
Sometimes she comes to tell me something.

1718
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,800
I may not take it to heart.

1719
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,400
including when she texted me on WeChat,

1720
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,440
I don't reply to her messages.

1721
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,640
And sometimes

1722
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,080
long voices, you know?

1723
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,240
I don't even want to listen to it.

1724
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,720
Then I didn't reply.

1725
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,720
But it doesn't matter to me.

1726
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,760
You don't have to reply.

1727
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,840
It's okay.

1728
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,440
Sister is so nice

1729
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,440
Her siblings are revealed.

1730
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,760
Although my sister

1731
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,880
didn't come to this show with me,

1732
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,920
But I think

1733
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,560
I can handle everything well.

1734
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,160
I want to say

1735
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,680
you are really excellent.

1736
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,880
I'm proud of you

1737
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,280
are very proud of you.

1738
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,320
You are the best

1739
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,200
in our hearts.

1740
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,880
During the show,

1741
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,160
don't be too stressed.

1742
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,480
Put down your mind. Come on.

1743
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,920
Come on.

1744
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,360
Can I call you Yinbo?

1745
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,960
Sure.

1746
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,360
Bobo, introduce yourself.

1747
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,360
Hello, my original name is Yuan Bo.

1748
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,480
My sister's name.

1749
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,120
Yuan Qiong.

1750
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,480
How did you know?

1751
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,360
I remember.

1752
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,200
I just put it in.

1753
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,560
Okay.

1754
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,160
I feel

1755
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,560
get to know you again today.

1756
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,320
Why don't we have a toast with the fruit cube?

1757
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,520
Okay.

1758
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,240
Cheers.

1759
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,480
Cheers.

1760
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,080
I found that everyone had ten cups.

1761
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,680
different mixed drinks.

1762
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,560
Really

1763
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,320
It's good no matter how you mix it.

1764
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,760
Sprinkle water.

1765
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,200
It's good.

1766
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:34,880
Very good.
