1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
It’s like a party. It’s like

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a surprise benefit.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Go on Weibo. Take part in #Love siblings and friends observation room #Interaction You might be the next one to be flipped.

9
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,160
It's the first time for boys to have a chat.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,720
A map is missing.

11
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
Yes, there's a map missing. I can't help it.

12
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
Next time, we'll add him.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,080
I'll fix it for him.

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Put a cartoon character together.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
to fix the big ear map for him.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,440
It'll be more fun tonight.

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,320
When do you think his brothers will show up?

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,560
I think they will.

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
How did you know it was his brother?

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,160
I don't think there's more than ten.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,400
I know it's impossible.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,520
but his brothers may not be the ones who show up.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
Maybe he's already here.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,760
Yes, I think his brother is Xiaoling.

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,760
This one.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
That's the smartest move.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
Right?

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,079
I just think there's Terri.

29
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm Harry. He's Tarri.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,400
It's very...

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
both of us are confident.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,079
I know his brother is you.

33
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,920
I see.

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,240
You two are brothers.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,640
You're back.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
What makes you so happy?

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,280
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
A little secret I don't know.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,720
How is it?

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Done.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,120
Right?

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Much more handsome.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
I like it.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
Your hairstyle is totally different.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Why are you laughing?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,480
Look at them.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Let's go.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,800
You're back.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Thank you. Hurry up.

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,079
Have you eaten?

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm a little hungry. Tell me the truth.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm a busy man.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,079
Good evening.

54
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,600
Wait.

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,840
What's wrong?

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Did you notice

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
I just saw

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,800
Why is there an extra dressing table?

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,960
Take a look.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,720
No way

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Really.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
I just saw

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,320
Xinxin.

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,279
Come here.

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,200
What's wrong?

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,000
Come on.

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
Look up.

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,920
There's a bed.

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,720
One more bed.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,640
So there should be a pair

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
New brothers are coming.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,320
So scary.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Suddenly there's an extra bed.

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
A dresser.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,520
I was a little flustered.

76
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,240
But it's okay.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
I'm still curious

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
about this female guest.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
So scary.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Do you think girls will come together?

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,800
Today?

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
I guess tonight...

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
So we don't need to guess

84
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
don't have to guess.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
It could be a split.

86
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
Maybe you all guessed it wrong.

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
So the boys

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
to have dinner.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
to meet the new female guest during dinner.

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
I guess

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,520
and vote for the new female guests.

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,440
The new male guest is your type.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,280
I feel...

95
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,800
I...

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
She said she likes bosses.

97
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
That boy is not the boss at all.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
Yes, but I think when he came in,

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,520
I saw something in your eyes.

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
I think

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
you've met him.

102
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
I haven't seen him yet.

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
You'll see him soon. I'll look at you.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,280
My first reaction was

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,480
to imagine what he would look like.

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
I want to meet him.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,200
I think

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,440
six siblings.

109
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,120
It's only five pairs now.

110
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you think there's another pair?

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think it's possible.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't think they look alike.

113
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,320
They look alike.

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
But they are both models.

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,440
It's obvious.

117
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Do you think you and your brother are alike?

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
Who is my brother?

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
Listen.

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,200
They look very elegant.

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
They have different styles.

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
No, that girl is really elegant.

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Yes, it's obvious what she does.

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
But they have different facial features.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Look at their faces.

126
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
Let's go.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Let's go straight into the room.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,840
Let's go.

129
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,320
Why are you laughing?

130
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,400
Yes, why are you laughing?

131
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,360
I'm speechless.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't laugh.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Hold it back.

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,920
Stop.

135
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
You're back.

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,640
Really?

137
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,280
Let's go.

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,560
Are you going to eat?

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes, we are.

140
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Did you go upstairs?

141
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Have a look.

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
Good evening.

143
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,720
Good evening.

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
Just the three of you?

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,320
Yes.

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,159
I lost it.

147
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
What happened?

148
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,440
There's a big show today.

149
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,520
Hurry up.

150
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Look.

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,000
There's a big show.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,720
You have me.

153
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,440
Do you know how wonderful we are?

154
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,400
You have a big show.

155
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,480
How wonderful are you?

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
We were so funny today.

157
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
You met a girl?

158
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,640
Did you meet the new female guests?

159
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm not telling you.

160
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,720
We met.

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
What are you doing?

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Why can't I say you can go and see it?

163
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
I saw him.

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,880
We have an extra room.

165
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes, there's one more table in their room.

166
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Not yet.

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,680
We should add it.

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Am I good?

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,480
You two...

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Where do you think their new guest lives?

171
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Probably your room.

172
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,800
It can't be our room.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Our room is full.

174
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
We can put a bed together.

175
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,440
It becomes a little crowded.

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,080
Your pressure is coming.

177
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm looking forward to it.

178
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,559
The first job

179
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,120
It's the same as the second job

180
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
But she's not that tall.

181
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,720
Not as tall as you.

182
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,320
Both.

183
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
I told you they would have dinner with girls.

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
Not with girls.

185
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,679
I didn't eat with a girl.

186
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
The four of us ate together.

187
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
How do you know that girl?

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
And you know she's not that tall.

189
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
Not as tall as Xiao Ling.

190
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,440
You must have seen her.

191
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Who says I'm not as tall as her?

192
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Why are you laughing?

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,080
What are you laughing at?

194
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
You guys are so mean.

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Really.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
Why can't I tell you?

197
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,400
The rules.

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,760
Okay, let's go.

199
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,320
Okay.

200
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Press the bell. The white one.

201
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
Someone is knocking.

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Hurry up.

203
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't keep us waiting.

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,760
He's here.

205
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,520
Good evening.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Good evening.

207
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
She has short hair.

208
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
The other girls

209
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,480
either have long hair like me,

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,520
or like flowers and Xinxin.

211
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,800
like flowers and Xinxin.

212
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,880
And she has only short hair.

213
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,960
So I think the style is different.

214
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,040
He's tall too.

215
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,360
I guess she's a model.

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,600
The first impression is a quiet girl.

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
She must be a model.

218
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I can't say it.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
The atmosphere is very Japanese.

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,400
Why don't we take the box up first?

221
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay.

222
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Let me see if it's heavy.

223
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,520
A little heavy.

224
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Come on.

225
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,720
So active.

226
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
Every day I eat.

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
Thank you.

228
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,680
It's a bit heavy.

229
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,040
We didn't know

230
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,920
what's on our attic.

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,880
It turns out to be your bed.

232
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,600
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

233
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,920
Is the map back?

234
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,160
No.

235
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
To Terri and Tata.

236
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,720
Welcome to the lovers' house.

237
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,200
You'll have a Cupid date.

238
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Please think carefully.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
The person you want to date

240
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,760
and write down the date content on the card.

241
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,600
Before sleeping,

242
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
(before sleeping.)

243
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Guess.

244
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,480
Now?

245
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,160
I'll write it tonight.

246
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
Right. Before sleeping,

247
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
before sleeping.

248
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
There's one more person.

249
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

250
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,880
It's okay. Take your time. Take your time.

251
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,280
You can try your best.

252
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,000
to find out who her brother is.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,360
with some connections and means.

254
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,040
Is it that hard to guess?

255
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
It's not hard to guess.

256
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,480
I think I've figured it out.

257
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Really? Why does it feel so hard?

258
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,440
I can see a pair now.

259
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
that pair of scores.

260
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,880
You can ask others secretly.

261
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
I won't.

262
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,800
We won't say it.

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,600
Right.

264
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,520
It's a secret.

265
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,600
We have to let you experience

266
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
what we experienced on the first day.

267
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
If you give it to the wrong person,

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,640
I'll go on that date too.

269
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,520
Tata.

270
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,680
I knew who you would write to.

271
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,920
I think I've guessed it too.

272
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,480
What's wrong with me?

273
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,160
I gave myself away.

274
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
So scary.

275
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,520
Tu is back.

276
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Tu, you're back.

277
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,760
Tu.

278
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,960
Tu, you...

279
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,120
It's been so long.

280
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,680
You...

281
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
What happened?

282
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,360
Something happened.

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
Come on. We have new friends.

284
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
Hurry up.

285
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
Okay, let's go.

286
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
I don't even want to wear my shoes.

287
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,280
Hurry up, Tu.

288
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Hello.

289
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
You'll be surprised

290
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
You'll be surprised.

291
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Really?

292
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,120
Hello

293
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,160
Two new friends.

294
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,920
Hello.

295
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm back.

296
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
I cut my hair.

297
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,520
I found it too.

298
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,880
Can you tell?

299
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
It's obvious.

300
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,120
Okay.

301
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,680
I edited it.

302
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Mangkud Head.

303
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
When I came back,

304
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
I found that

305
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,200
in the house.

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,960
It makes me feel this situation

307
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,520
is getting interesting.

308
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Let me introduce myself.

309
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,960
My name is Tu.

310
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
The map with big ears.

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
The first impression of the picture.

312
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,280
I think he looks good.

313
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
but he has good taste.

314
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,560
When I see a simple guy,

315
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,240
Will you arrive in the afternoon or at night?

316
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,680
I arrived in the afternoon.

317
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I arrived at night.

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
My impression of the picture is the sunshine.

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,400
What a sunny boy.

320
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,240
He's full of energy.

321
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm sure you like your type.

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,880
How to write

323
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,520
I don't know.

324
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,680
Did you guess it?

325
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,480
My mind is empty.

326
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
I think

327
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
I guessed the pair.

328
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,760
Nothing else was obvious.

329
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,160
Yes.

330
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,360
My name is Tata.

331
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,280
I like taking photos.

332
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
I like pets.

333
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,120
I like walking dogs.

334
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
and watching movies.

335
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,240
When I was a sophomore,

336
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,680
my brothers took me into the industry

337
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,000
and started to be a model.

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,280
My brother is

339
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,560
a cheerful boy.

340
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,680
I'm three years older than her.

341
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,000
I happened to see a photo.

342
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
when I was five years old

343
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
with my family when I was five.

344
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,280
She was wearing sunglasses.

345
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,080
and made a cute pose.

346
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,200
That was the first time I realized

347
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I had a sister.

348
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,560
We planned to get the second child.

349
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,840
I told her when we got married.

350
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
I said it'd be best to have two children.

351
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
Whether it's two daughters

352
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Both sons and two children

353
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Because when she gives birth to a daughter,

354
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,520
many people told her not to give birth.

355
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,400
I said no.

356
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
I want to give birth now.

357
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
The two of them are separated.

358
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,800
They're smaller.

359
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,200
and have two children.

360
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,840
They both have friends

361
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
That's how you consider giving birth to two children

362
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,720
Children can be

363
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
One daughter and one child.

364
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,760
It's good to have both children, right?

365
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,320
It's still full of happiness.

366
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,040
I've liked my sister since I was a kid.

367
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,960
When I first saw her,

368
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,120
touch her feet.

369
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,640
Kiss her face.

370
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
It's still warm.

371
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Seeing this scene,

372
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,760
my daughter is a very beautiful

373
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,480
and adorable little girl.

374
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
She's really a good girl.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
In the eyes of others,

376
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,800
they are all very polite.

377
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,280
From elementary school to college

378
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,800
from elementary school to college.

379
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,160
I worked hard.

380
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,600
My family said

381
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,040
they are the best dish

382
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
The best dish.

383
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
The most beautiful dish.

384
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,680
That's what I mean

385
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
We fought a lot when we were kids.

386
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,640
Yes.

387
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't have much

388
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,440
I didn't

389
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,960
to be a brother.

390
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,280
After she graduated,

391
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,920
we're in the same industry now.

392
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,880
Maybe I have more

393
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,720
like a brother.

394
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,040
When you grow up and grow up,

395
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,240
You know how important he is.

396
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,200
I was at home with him when I was young.

397
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,560
I had a

398
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
Mickey watch.

399
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,680
He pretended to take a look.

400
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,480
But he took out Mickey

401
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,360
on my watch.

402
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
She cried at home

403
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
Then he told his mom to come over

404
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,160
It was memorable.

405
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Until now,

406
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,520
my Mickey watch.

407
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
I think you did it on purpose.

408
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,120
Because I feel that he ruined

409
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
was ruined by him.

410
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,040
My hands are so weak.

411
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
Maybe I have the feeling of being mean.

412
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
I want to tease her.

413
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Because since she was young,

414
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,320
she's a good student.

415
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
I've been dancing

416
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
in class.

417
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,280
I may be worried

418
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,560
my parents worry about me

419
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,480
more than her.

420
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,200
They don't worry about my study.

421
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,240
Since I was young,

422
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
watch TV and play with phone.

423
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,880
And sometimes

424
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,840
I'd peel the door quietly.

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
I used to be the role.

426
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
I saw him there secretly.

427
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
or there.

428
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
or playing with something.

429
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
or playing with my phone.

430
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,480
I'll snitch.

431
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,000
My sister often complained to us.

432
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
The elder brother bullied her.

433
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
That's it.

434
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,640
But when we spoil our sister,

435
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
more.

436
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,560
For example,

437
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,920
we have a separate room.

438
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,640
She reserved the room first

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,000
Then her son will choose the rest.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A room that's not good enough

441
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
But we'll give her

442
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,560
and give her something better.

443
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,920
I usually nag a lot of kids.

444
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,760
She's not afraid of me.

445
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,040
When her dad says something,

446
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
they are afraid.

447
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
I just corrected the big direction.

448
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,960
But when her dad talks too much,

449
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,040
or talk too much,

450
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,360
I feel bad for my child.

451
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,520
I always help my child in the middle.

452
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
If a dad sings blushing,

453
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
Mom will sing the white face

454
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,480
Mom sings "Red Face".

455
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
Daddy will sing "White Face".

456
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,840
She's a group pet

457
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
She grew up with the care and care of her family.

458
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,440
She's kind and meticulous.

459
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
but a little slow.

460
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,520
I have

461
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,560
a strong personality.

462
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,560
My daughter is the one who got into college.

463
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,400
I couldn't help but

464
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I hugged her and cried.

465
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,040
I was worried that she couldn't eat well or eat well.

466
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm afraid she'll catch a cold when she sleeps.

467
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,920
I was worried.

468
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,680
When I get home,

469
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,120
I've been in a bad state for days.

470
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,200
I was thinking about

471
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
with my daughter.

472
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,200
I cried for days.

473
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,080
I can't stop

474
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,520
for a long time.

475
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,720
She would share

476
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,040
about her love life.

477
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
For example, let me be the judge

478
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
or analyze this.

479
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
I'll give her some advice

480
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,400
and some feedback.

481
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,120
I don't know if he'll listen or not.

482
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
He's very objective.

483
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,680
Who can listen to this?

484
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
Because she probably

485
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
she would tell me after the deal was done.

486
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,120
I didn't participate in the process.

487
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,960
Because she is

488
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,200
a slow person.

489
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
is among a group of people.

490
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
if she is willing to talk to someone,

491
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
or share,

492
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
Maybe she is interesting.

493
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,360
Yes.

494
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,480
I hope she can become more independent and stronger.

495
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,600
and make the family less worried about her.

496
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Yes.

497
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,240
Daughter, go to this show.

498
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,320
Dad and mom

499
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,440
are your strong support.

500
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
Come on.

501
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I wish my daughter

502
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,880
find a half of her heart.

503
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,800
Come on.

504
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
How do you feel today?

505
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
How do I put it?

506
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Anyway, I got something unexpected today.

507
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,840
and every male guest

508
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,680
each male guest

509
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,640
I had ten minutes to chat with them.

510
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,880
I talked to everyone.

511
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,760
One-on-one?

512
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,160
Yes, one on one.

513
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,280
I was a little nervous.

514
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,360
But today a boy

515
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,280
was absent from work.

516
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,080
So we talked about four boys today.

517
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,240
I have a mission to write.

518
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,560
The Cupid invitation card is

519
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,640
I want to write it to the person I want to date.

520
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
But I have to

521
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,680
to his brothers.

522
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
But you know.

523
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Yes, but I don't know who his brother is.

524
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
Now we have to guess.

525
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,680
The first boy is...

526
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
has a cheerful personality.

527
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,480
We can find something to talk about.

528
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,920
The second one is...

529
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,760
can he take the initiative to find some topics?

530
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,080
Yes, yes. He is E.

531
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,800
The second one is I (introverted).

532
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,600
But I think

533
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,080
is the E most.

534
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,720
Because he talks the most.

535
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,320
When he said he was embarrassed,

536
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,040
he kept looking for something to say.

537
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,800
He kept talking.

538
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,160
And when I talked to him,

539
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,000
when talking to him.

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,560
So I chose

541
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,960
to keep talking to him for ten minutes.

542
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,720
Being with him

543
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,000
makes you more relaxed, right?

544
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Because he wants to talk more.

545
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
The third one is

546
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
the atmosphere is more awkward.

547
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,040
Because

548
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,120
didn't break the ice, right?

549
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
Yes, I've been trying to find the topic.

550
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,320
The order of choosing people is

551
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,440
to see their childhood photos.

552
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,320
But the third boy

553
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
He has thick eyebrows and big eyes.

554
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,440
He looks good.

555
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
What about the second one?

556
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
The second one looks

557
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,840
Not bad.

558
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,280
The fourth boy is...

559
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,120
How should I put it?

560
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
I can talk to him.

561
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,520
But

562
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,840
I can't give him the invitation card yet.

563
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,480
I can't write it to him.

564
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
You'll know later.

565
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
I won't tell you.

566
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,680
Okay.

567
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
What do you mean by surprise?

568
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
Surprise.

569
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,560
That's what I can't tell you.

570
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,960
There's another guy who's working outside.

571
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,120
He just came back tonight.

572
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
We just met.

573
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,640
I don't know much about him.

574
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,760
It sounds like...

575
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,960
Based on my consideration,

576
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,480
I think

577
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,080
to someone who talks more.

578
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,720
And he can cook.

579
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,600
Cooking?

580
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,040
Yes, he can cook.

581
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,240
You feel relaxed when you're together.

582
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,560
It makes you relaxed.

583
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,720
Because the other person talks a lot.

584
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
Yes.

585
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,360
Did you write this invitation card

586
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,200
just an invitation for a date?

587
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
That's what it means.

588
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
Since it makes you comfortable,

589
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,720
you can.

590
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
But I don't know

591
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,880
who his brother is.

592
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,120
A girl...

593
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,360
This guy.

594
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,840
He was lying next to that girl.

595
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,320
I knew you two were close.

596
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,760
Is it your turn?

597
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,480
No.

598
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,640
Are you close?

599
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
We're brothers.

600
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,840
Did you announce it directly?

601
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,600
Didn't you guess it?

602
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
I'll tell you

603
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,200
I'll tell you.

604
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Then they said they were siblings.

605
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,960
But I don't know

606
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
or lying to me.

607
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
It could be confusing.

608
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
Maybe

609
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
You did it on purpose, right?

610
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,080
Yes.

611
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
What if he didn't get it?

612
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
what's the use?

613
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,240
We still need to get in touch.

614
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
I have to guess.

615
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,080
But I just came here today.

616
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,440
I don't think I know

617
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
What do you think? Should I give it to this girl?

618
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,640
I don't know if she lied to me.

619
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,400
but I do feel that they are close.

620
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,960
They exposed their identities.

621
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,800
I think this kind of

622
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,240
is just a bluff.

623
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,720
I don't think they're siblings.

624
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,040
I don't have more information now.

625
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,960
I don't know who to give it to.

626
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,120
I can give it a try.

627
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,040
Okay.

628
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,640
Okay.

629
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
Okay, bye.

630
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,520
Okay, bye.

631
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,240
I ran here.

632
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,840
Let's talk about the feelings.

633
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,920
It's obvious that I can guess it.

634
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,640
Because we're not

635
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,920
boys' chatting party today.

636
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,840
Then we asked

637
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,600
They said who had the best first impression.

638
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,920
Ask Terri.

639
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Terri said Susu.

640
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,040
But he knows

641
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,160
what my name is.

642
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,560
What's her name?

643
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Let me think.

644
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
Okay.

645
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,400
I think we should really forget it.

646
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
or

647
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
it can draw some attention.

648
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
I think he really forgot.

649
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Maybe.

650
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
Who did you send it to? Tell me.

651
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
Soup.

652
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,720
I knew it.

653
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,880
I also sent you the soup.

654
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,520
Yes.

655
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,680
He made me

656
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
sandwich.

657
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,280
It's okay.

658
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,720
As long as you have one,

659
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,520
as long as you have one.

660
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm relieved.

661
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,760
But...

662
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,520
But now I know

663
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,280
we are roommates after all.

664
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,400
We do get along well.

665
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,080
It's obvious that

666
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,160
I think he gets along well with you.

667
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,480
Really.

668
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
Because I think it's because

669
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
with other girls.

670
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,000
No.

671
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
So he only chose me.

672
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,640
But for example,

673
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,880
there will be other dates

674
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,760
or blind choices.

675
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,560
If he had been in contact

676
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,280
for a whole day.

677
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I didn't think he would give me

678
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,000
And I don't think

679
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,440
he would choose me.

680
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,400
Don't worry. I don't think he'll give it to others.

681
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I think he will only give it to you.

682
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,280
You seem to have high expectations for him.

683
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,640
I do.

684
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm disappointed when I have expectations.

685
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,240
I think at least

686
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,400
the fifth, sixth and seventh days,

687
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,200
he will give you.

688
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,800
What did you send him?

689
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,440
I sent him yesterday...

690
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,800
OK.

691
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,560
Next time

692
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,080
more piano songs next time?

693
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
You were not home at that time.

694
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,560
You went on a date.

695
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
and he was playing the piano downstairs.

696
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,840
Then I went down.

697
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
Let him play

698
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,800
my favorite song.

699
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,880
But he said it was too hard.

700
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,840
so he didn't play it.

701
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,200
I wanted to learn that when I came back.

702
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,880
but I couldn't.

703
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,600
Is it hard to learn?

704
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,280
No.

705
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,960
It doesn't look like this.

706
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,880
A little hint?

707
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
Yes, see if he will

708
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,640
my words.

709
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
Yes, let's see if he'll learn.

710
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,200
Yes.

711
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,960
But it's okay if you don't learn.

712
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,760
It's okay.

713
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,680
It doesn't matter.

714
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,360
It does.

715
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm still a little disappointed.

716
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,680
Yes.

717
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,800
It's only been a few days.

718
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
It's a bit demanding. I can only say

719
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,920
Really?

720
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,000
He can play.

721
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,240
He can play the piano.

722
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,760
That's true.

723
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,080
Let's see if he's willing to learn for you.

724
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,160
What did he write?

725
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
We can go out together sometime.

726
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
That's all.

727
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,520
A punctuation symbol and a small expression.

728
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
Do you know what else I came here?

729
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,920
What?

730
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
I had a good chat with you.

731
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,760
Who's talking to you?

732
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,920
I don't think it's Xiaoling.

733
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,720
It should be the new girl.

734
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,880
Very short.

735
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,080
The other one is Xinxin.

736
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Yes.

737
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,920
Anyway, I think it's good.

738
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,760
You have another choice

739
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,000
another choice.

740
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,920
But I don't think Tae-seo

741
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,240
pick his brother.

742
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,680
I think so too.

743
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
And what's Terri?

744
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,520
Tae-ri is also a happy puppy.

745
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,120
ENFP.

746
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,080
Yes.

747
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,880
And he said

748
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,040
he's more emotional.

749
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,920
In a relationship,

750
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,400
if you can't receive

751
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,600
a little hint,

752
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
he will be passive.

753
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,360
But if he received any hints,

754
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,600
he will take the initiative.

755
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,560
That's what he said.

756
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
I like happy puppies.

757
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,360
If you just look at MBTI,

758
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,040
I like happy puppy.

759
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,560
Because I think "Happy Puppy" will be

760
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,760
the straight ball will be more passionate.

761
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,320
But you may not like him.

762
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,160
He is very confident.

763
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,000
He's a confident person.

764
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
I just think that girl

765
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
she must be...

766
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,080
First, I think she's just simple.

767
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,000
Because she's an introvert.

768
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,360
She thinks the texture of talking to me

769
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,920
to chat with me.

770
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,840
It's not that awkward.

771
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Because you talk a lot.

772
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,000
Yes.

773
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,480
That's all.

774
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,760
Who did you text today?

775
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,320
To Xin.

776
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,480
What did you send?

777
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,120
It's too much.

778
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,000
I edited it in advance.

779
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,960
and didn't see me press it.

780
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,320
Then I put my phone down.

781
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
So what did you send?

782
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm not telling you.

783
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Why not?

784
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,360
I just don't want to.

785
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,080
I said mine.

786
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,600
I don't want to say it.

787
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,360
What did you send today?

788
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
I said it's delicious.

789
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Very talented.

790
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Much better than master's

791
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,160
Hunger expression.

792
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,360
This is a bit clear. I can only say

793
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,640
So clear.

794
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,760
Then you should use the whole bracket.

795
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,720
Attention. Where's the piano song?

796
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,240
No.

797
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,160
You're too...

798
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,840
You're forcing me.

799
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,760
Asking her?

800
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,080
Because I'm not in a relationship or clear.

801
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
I can't ask others to go because of me.

802
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,800
Yes, of course.

803
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
I'll keep watch for you anyway.

804
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,280
I'll watch them for you.

805
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
Both of them are in my room.

806
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,600
What do you mean?

807
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,640
Let's see who's more compatible.

808
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
First, I think

809
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,040
Second,

810
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
I think we can get along.

811
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,960
I'll take a look.

812
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,960
Do you want to try Terri?

813
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,600
You want to try Terri.

814
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
I can give him a hint.

815
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,320
that you were wrong today.

816
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,800
OK. Anything is fine.

817
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,600
Do you want to try?

818
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,240
Sure.

819
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,200
Then I can...

820
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,560
I'll find a chance to tell him today.

821
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,920
If he gives me the invitation card,

822
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,320
then you two

823
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,720
go on a date with Cupid.

824
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,840
We'll see. It depends on fate.

825
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,800
Help!

826
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,920
Do you need some advice?

827
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,520
Really?

828
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,280
Let's go back to our room.

829
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,680
Let's go.

830
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,640
Sit on the sofa and talk.

831
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,680
Let me ask you first.

832
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,520
Do you think your guess is right today?

833
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,080
I'm pretty sure of two pairs.

834
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,120
Do you think you're sure of me?

835
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,800
Yes, you and your sister

836
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
and Xiao Ling...

837
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,560
Let me tell you. You're wrong.

838
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,840
Really?

839
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,840
Don't lie to me.

840
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,640
Really?

841
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
If you think you want to go on a date

842
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,040
with someone you like,

843
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,120
Think about it.

844
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,600
If you make a mistake,

845
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,480
it might be a little awkward.

846
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,120
Could it be

847
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
I don't think it's Fatty.

848
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,640
I don't know.

849
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,960
I think there are only a few groups.

850
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Why don't you go with Xinxin or Huahua?

851
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,240
Not necessarily.

852
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,520
I think so.

853
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,160
You can guess like that for now.

854
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,800
Hello.

855
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,480
You're here.

856
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,800
Are you alone?

857
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,680
Am I not human?

858
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,760
I want to say, just new friends?

859
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,840
I thought Tata.

860
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,920
Have a seat.

861
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Sit on the bed.

862
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,680
It's okay.

863
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,320
Sit here.

864
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,840
I was too anxious just now.

865
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,280
I felt

866
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,480
Something must have happened

867
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,760
something happened today.

868
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,200
Because today,

869
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,280
we had a good chat.

870
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,320
After chatting,

871
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,880
who his crush is.

872
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,400
First impression.

873
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,080
Yes, first impression.

874
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,960
Yes.

875
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,880
They also have this.

876
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,400
Cupid.

877
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,920
So you're hesitating who to write.

878
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Yes.

879
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
My sister didn't receive her message.

880
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,440
So I want to help her.

881
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
A new friend.

882
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,840
Give her a chance.

883
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Do you think you'll give it to me?

884
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,640
Do you think...

885
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,640
If he didn't tell me this,

886
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,520
I might have given it to you.

887
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,920
Follow your heart. Don't listen.

888
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,560
Listen.

889
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm only here today, right?

890
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,880
That's why you should cover yourself.

891
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,400
Cover yourself?

892
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,720
According to my guess,

893
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,840
I said I'll help you.

894
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,920
I'll help you when we eat.

895
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,440
Since she wants to, as her brother,

896
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,680
I think I should help her.

897
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,160
It may not be good,

898
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
to my roommate,

899
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,639
But I can try it.

900
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,159
I think I know

901
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,880
who he likes.

902
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,400
But you have to see for yourself.

903
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Yes.

904
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
Take a guess.

905
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
So I'm telling you,

906
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Follow your heart.

907
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,719
I'm here to help you.

908
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,719
What do you mean?

909
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,199
I know who he likes.

910
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,480
I'm here to help him.

911
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay, I'll check over there.

912
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Sure.

913
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,520
Go for a walk.

914
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,360
Did you ask me to vote for you?

915
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,719
Give me the invitation card.

916
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,679
I didn't say anything.

917
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,600
You can think about it.

918
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,480
Yes.

919
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,199
So I'm sure

920
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,400
give Fatty this invitation card

921
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,159
or

922
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,800
It should be Fatty.

923
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
Shake your head.

924
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,680
Really?

925
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,520
Think about it.

926
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,520
I'm helping you now.

927
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,080
If you say so,

928
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,840
it must mean to you.

929
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,920
Don't make it so clear.

930
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm just here to talk to you.

931
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay.

932
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,400
If you choose someone else,

933
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,120
you might have made a wrong choice.

934
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,080
I know and I find that

935
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,640
Why didn't you listen to me?

936
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,760
If you chose

937
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
I hint to you,

938
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,680
you'll know what that person is like.

939
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,600
and tell me

940
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,720
whether I have

941
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,200
to you?

942
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,120
Thinking in the wind

943
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm going for a walk too.

944
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,680
Okay, go ahead.

945
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,560
Help!

946
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,800
It's down. I've decided.

947
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Still thinking.

948
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,840
Let me think about it.

949
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
Give it to me.

950
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,720
Give it to me.

951
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,680
I want to know

952
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,400
what Harry drugged you.

953
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,200
He's so sincere.

954
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,480
I trust you this time.

955
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,440
Will you choose?

956
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
You choose slowly.

957
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,440
Trust you.

958
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,280
Trust you once.

959
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,760
Trust me once.

960
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,520
I hope you didn't lie to me.

961
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,040
Harry.

962
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,880
When I asked for Cupid's invitation card,

963
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,560
he told me a lot.

964
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,000
I think he is a very sincere person.

965
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,680
So I chose to trust him in the end.

966
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,080
And I gave him

967
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,200
my (Cupid) invitation card.

968
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
Good evening.

969
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,680
You're my brother.

970
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,040
You are me.

971
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,800
I can understand why

972
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
Why don't you have one?

973
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,320
Why not?

974
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,800
I have no contact with anyone.

975
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,720
And I think

976
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,320
they are all in love.

977
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,680
Who are you sending to?

978
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
I'll send it to Xinxin.

979
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
Guess who I sent it to today.

980
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,360
I'm definitely not a newcomer.

981
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,560
I sent him a welcome check-in.

982
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
I thought maybe no one

983
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,800
no one would send it to him.

984
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,520
So I sent him a welcome message.

985
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,960
Because in this small house,

986
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,840
I just want to have more contact with them.

987
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,960
But from today,

988
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,000
I think we can send it to the newcomers.

989
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Let him feel our warmth.

990
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,520
I found that our passion was destroyed.

991
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,640
The last time we came to the siblings' house,

992
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
Do we look alike now?

993
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
But today, the two of us...

994
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,840
I'm telling you, I've confirmed it.

995
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,400
Comedians don't have love

996
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,480
So from tomorrow

997
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,960
I'm not funny anymore.

998
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,840
Me too.

999
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,600
I can't do that anymore.

1000
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm here to date.

1001
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm not here to be funny.

1002
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,480
You're not here to cook

1003
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes.

1004
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,160
I'll behave tomorrow.

1005
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,000
I'll be the cold prince tomorrow.

1006
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,360
I'm a cold and warm man.

1007
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,320
Then I'm the ice queen.

1008
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,680
You're the Ice Princess.

1009
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,720
Then they found out they were talking to you.

1010
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,880
Can you pretend for one day tomorrow?

1011
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,760
Okay.

1012
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,640
Pretend for a day.

1013
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,040
If you don't receive my message at night,

1014
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll stop pretending.

1015
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,920
Just funny men and women

1016
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,000
So tired.

1017
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
I want to lie here for a while.

1018
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,320
I think

1019
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,240
Tired.

1020
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,280
Yes.

1021
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,840
It's okay. I'll get it tomorrow.

1022
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
So it's still the same conclusion.

1023
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,000
The slogan.

1024
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,040
There's no love between a funny man and a woman.

1025
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
I'll focus on observing tomorrow.

1026
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,000
Susu and Xinxin.

1027
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,600
Can you be your master?

1028
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,480
Go for it yourself.

1029
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,040
Why are you observing them?

1030
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,360
You just pick up the dishes left by others.

1031
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,840
Can you take the initiative?

1032
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,200
But after observing them,

1033
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,560
I found out if others have feelings for him.

1034
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,640
If someone else likes him,

1035
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,960
why would I butt in?

1036
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,080
Then why? No.

1037
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,200
She likes him.

1038
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
People change.

1039
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,560
Everyone changes.

1040
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,600
It's not fun to grow old

1041
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,960
Let's get to know each other.

1042
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,360
And I actually want to know about Xiao Ling.

1043
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,800
Xiao Ling...

1044
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,680
Xiao Ling said she's changing too.

1045
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,240
But I don't know

1046
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,880
Really?

1047
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,960
You...

1048
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
But I'm sure she didn't send it to me.

1049
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,440
Of course not.

1050
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,600
How can I send you the zero?

1051
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,240
Pay more attention to others.

1052
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,800
And don't "central air conditioner".

1053
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,640
I think Xiao Ling

1054
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,920
I guess there's no rule today.

1055
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,320
Yes.

1056
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,200
You also have zero clauses.

1057
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,280
Two for Susu.

1058
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
Then I'll learn from Xiao Ling.

1059
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
Dok-mi!

1060
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
The heroine.

1061
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,760
It's their loss to not like me.

1062
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,720
It's not my loss.

1063
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,080
I won't be a comedian from tomorrow on

1064
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,960
I won't be a comedian

1065
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,720
Come on.

1066
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,560
Go.

1067
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,800
You suddenly kicked me.

1068
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm sorry.

1069
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,080
We have to cheer up.

1070
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,120
Cheer up.

1071
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,600
So tired.

1072
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
I feel more tired.

1073
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,920
Good evening.

1074
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,680
Here's something for you.

1075
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Here's something for you.

1076
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,800
What?

1077
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,000
Hand cream.

1078
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Do you apply hand cream?

1079
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
That's enough. Thank you.

1080
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,360
I think I'm a mixed dough.

1081
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,320
But it's dry when I do it.

1082
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,400
He needs a hand cream.

1083
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,560
It's been a few days.

1084
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,440
I haven't found the right time

1085
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,200
to give it to him.

1086
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,880
in front of many people.

1087
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,680
It's quite awkward.

1088
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,080
So I choose

1089
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,200
to give him this hand cream

1090
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
when we're alone.

1091
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,280
I'm so happy.

1092
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,720
Today is the first day.

1093
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,680
Are you nervous?

1094
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
A little.

1095
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
Do you have anyone

1096
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,360
you really want to date today?

1097
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,480
There's someone who tends to date, right?

1098
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I think I have an idea too.

1099
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,680
There's an answer.

1100
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,040
I guessed it.

1101
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,960
I guessed it.

1102
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,920
Can you drink it?

1103
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,800
Yes.

1104
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
Let's add wine together.

1105
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,920
and wish us a sip of peach wine.

1106
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,280
Peach blossoms will be there soon.

1107
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,520
You're really something.

1108
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
It tastes good no matter how I mix it.

1109
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,080
Do you have a mission?

1110
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,480
Here.

1111
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,520
Do you have a mission?

1112
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,880
When?

1113
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
Just now.

1114
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,000
Hurry.

1115
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,360
First come first served.

1116
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,960
Hurry.

1117
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,520
Is there a new mission?

1118
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,480
Come down.

1119
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,440
I'll be right there.

1120
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,320
To members of the house

1121
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,960
Crack and play snow together

1122
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,720
In this romantic winter

1123
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,840
in this romantic winter.

1124
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,600
Here are five invitations for partners.

1125
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,520
But on the card,

1126
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,840
on the card,

1127
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,200
to him.

1128
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,320
Finished forming.

1129
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,520
First come first served.

1130
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,600
Attention, those who have received many invitations

1131
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,480
can make a choice.

1132
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,360
Those who are rejected

1133
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,160
You need to choose your partner again.

1134
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
Okay.

1135
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,360
Sprinkle flowers.

1136
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,720
Come and get it.

1137
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,600
I didn't receive any text yesterday.

1138
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,120
And I'm not sure

1139
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,240
if someone will pick me today.

1140
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,280
I don't want to choose others.

1141
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Because I think

1142
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,800
a little awkward.

1143
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Then I didn't move.

1144
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,280
Who did you write?

1145
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,000
Susu.

1146
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,360
Here's your invitation card.

1147
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,120
Thank you.

1148
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,320
Are you good at sports?

1149
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,280
I...

1150
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,320
Not bad.

1151
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,840
She's amazing.

1152
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,920
Do I trust you?

1153
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,120
Yes.

1154
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,720
What?

1155
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,240
Pick me.

1156
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,720
I'll choose someone who's good at sports.

1157
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,520
Don't let me down.

1158
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,760
I'll try.

1159
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,160
I saw him

1160
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,120
I gave it to Xiaoling.

1161
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,640
I feel a little disappointed.

1162
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,880
Coming.

1163
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,720
Is it for me?

1164
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,360
What else?

1165
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,000
Let's go.

1166
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,440
Why are you giving it to me?

1167
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
Invite you.

1168
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,000
What does this mean?

1169
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
What does it mean?

1170
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,240
What does it mean?

1171
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,880
What does it mean?

1172
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,840
Isn't it a boy giving it to a girl?

1173
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,480
Who said that?

1174
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,840
Whoever gets the card has the right to give it

1175
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,240
It makes me

1176
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,520
scratched my ears and cheeks.

1177
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,600
Let's eat

1178
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,520
It's getting cold for a while.

1179
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,880
Did you make this for everyone?

1180
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,080
Yes.

1181
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,680
First come first served.

1182
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,200
Try the poison for me.

1183
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,880
First come first served.

1184
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,680
Come on, bro.

1185
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Come on.

1186
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,000
I can try five poisons.

1187
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,440
You can try them all.

1188
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,800
This pot is all your "poison".

1189
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,560
I saw you eat.

1190
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,720
Then I saw your expression.

1191
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
Dumplings

1192
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,400
is delicious when cooked.

1193
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,640
Then give me a bowl.

1194
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,120
Have you ever seen dumplings taste bad?

1195
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,120
Do you have a portion?

1196
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,680
Everyone has a share.

1197
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,920
It looks delicious.

1198
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,320
I'll get you chopsticks.

1199
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,440
I'll take it there.

1200
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,160
It's hot.

1201
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,000
Thank you.

1202
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,280
It's hot, right?

1203
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,520
Did Xiaoling eat?

1204
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,000
No.

1205
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,880
I'll eat it now.

1206
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,560
Okay.

1207
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,360
The idea Hua gave me is

1208
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,800
if you want to know more about others,

1209
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,640
try to understand others.

1210
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,520
But today I feel

1211
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,640
a little unhappy today.

1212
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,120
Did you get

1213
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,720
Did you get the invitation card?

1214
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, I got one for you.

1215
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
You're really a good roommate, Rafang.

1216
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,720
I voted for soup for you.

1217
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,960
I'll go get that.

1218
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,320
Bring me the cake I bought.

1219
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,800
Today's birthday.

1220
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,280
Tae-seo.

1221
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,120
I had no idea.

1222
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,760
Last night...

1223
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,240
You went up yesterday.

1224
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,400
What?

1225
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Look at the time.

1226
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,480
Today is your birthday.

1227
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
Really?

1228
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,320
Today is Tae-ri's birthday.

1229
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,560
I forgot.

1230
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,960
My friend sent it, so I realized it.

1231
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,640
Yes.

1232
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,360
Leave the cake to me.

1233
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,520
Terri doesn't know yet.

1234
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,840
Who did you give the map to?

1235
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,640
I don't have the invitation card.

1236
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,920
The map didn't (invite). Cut.

1237
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,480
Actually, I was a little late.

1238
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,520
It's not that

1239
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,200
Why?

1240
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,000
Isn't it good to have the initiative?

1241
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,640
Actually,

1242
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,880
if someone receives two at the same time,

1243
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,200
one of them

1244
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,960
and be abandoned.

1245
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,000
You need to find someone to team up with.

1246
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,680
Yes.

1247
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,400
It's a bit miserable.

1248
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
I only gave it to one person.

1249
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,560
That person rejected me.

1250
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,200
I'll choose again.

1251
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,080
Is that what it means?

1252
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,680
I think so.

1253
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,480
But if it's only one person,

1254
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,760
I don't think he'll refuse.

1255
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,200
I gave it to him at the same time.

1256
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,840
Who?

1257
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,560
Soup.

1258
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,120
Yes.

1259
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,760
Tae-seo, let's take a photo.

1260
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,920
Tae-seo.

1261
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,640
Let's take a family photo.

1262
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,760
Come and take a photo.

1263
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,560
Happy birthday to you

1264
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,840
Thank you.

1265
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,720
Let me do it.

1266
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,280
Let's take a video first.

1267
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,800
And the video.

1268
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,200
Blow it.

1269
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,840
Happy birthday to you

1270
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,680
Recording videos again

1271
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,800
and sing me a birthday song.

1272
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,480
Really

1273
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,760
We ordered cakes again

1274
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm so touched.

1275
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,000
This birthday

1276
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,720
I feel really happy.

1277
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,200
Okay, thank you.

1278
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,320
Thank you.

1279
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,360
Thank you so much for the cake.

1280
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,960
Thank you.

1281
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,400
Eat up.

1282
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,480
You have cake and

1283
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
dumplings.

1284
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,760
Yours.

1285
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,600
What should I do?

1286
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,280
What should I do?

1287
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,560
Come with me.

1288
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,240
What should I do?

1289
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,040
Who should I return the invitation card to?

1290
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,800
Today is Tae-seo's birthday.

1291
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,000
Don't think about

1292
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,680
about your birthday.

1293
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,880
But I rejected her

1294
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,720
and then rejected her.

1295
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,560
Don't be upset because of your birthday.

1296
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,360
Listen.

1297
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,000
If it's normal,

1298
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,800
I would choose soup.

1299
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,240
Why?

1300
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,760
Because he was the first one to give it to me.

1301
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,680
Then you choose the soup first.

1302
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,440
Do you know why?

1303
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,840
Because Tae-seo hesitated for a long time.

1304
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,800
I don't know if it's because I'm sorry.

1305
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,960
I was hesitating.

1306
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,200
Can you not wear shoes?

1307
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,120
Can you come over?

1308
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,480
Okay.

1309
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:30,840
What's wrong?

1310
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,040
Happy birthday.

1311
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,880
Thank you.

1312
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,280
I'm sorry.

1313
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,920
OK.

1314
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,720
After KeyNG returned the invitation card to me,

1315
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,560
I feel complicated.

1316
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,280
Because I was quite confident.

1317
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,480
I didn't expect to be rejected.

1318
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,800
Do you have a backpack?

1319
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,760
Do you have something to put in your bag?

1320
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,040
I want to die.

1321
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,920
I returned the invitation card to your brother.

1322
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,440
Why?

1323
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,280
Because I have two.

1324
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,400
I want to return one.

1325
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,400
You rejected him?

1326
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,760
No.

1327
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,280
I'm not saying no.

1328
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,120
Because he was the second to give it to me.

1329
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,440
I still want to choose that one.

1330
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,240
Clear.

1331
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,040
Xiao Ling.

1332
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,960
I'm going to a sports event with Susu's team today.

1333
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,480
Can I borrow your fragrant shampoo

1334
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,560
that fragrant shampoo last time.

1335
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,880
You've learned to flatter yourself.

1336
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,600
Fine, take it.

1337
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,400
This is my dating weapon.

1338
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo.

1339
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,360
Can you use it?

1340
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,600
Of course I know.

1341
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,320
It's so fluffy after washing my hair.

1342
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,520
You can grow two centimeters taller.

1343
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,680
OK. You’re really 1.9 meters.

1344
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,800
It’s confirmed.

1345
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,280
Go ahead.

1346
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,080
I wish you success.

1347
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,960
Thank you.

1348
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,760
Come on. Gather around.

1349
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,920
Let's go.

1350
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,800
Let's go.

1351
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,080
Susu, Tata.

1352
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,200
Coming.

1353
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,360
Tata, did you give the invitation card?

1354
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,000
I did.

1355
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,760
Who did you give it to?

1356
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,640
Harry.

1357
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,280
Do you have two?

1358
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,240
How many?

1359
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,120
One.

1360
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,520
But I gave it to her.

1361
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,880
They're done. Let's go out.

1362
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,400
Bye.

1363
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,000
We have six left.

1364
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,960
Harry, are you sure to give it to Xinxin?

1365
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,760
When I went out,

1366
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,440
I found out

1367
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,960
Harry has an invitation card too.

1368
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,160
and sent it to Xinxin.

1369
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,760
I've already admitted

1370
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,200
I formed a team with Harry.

1371
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,400
I'm a little surprised.

1372
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,080
Just the four of us.

1373
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,000
Just the two of us.

1374
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,320
Okay.

1375
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,480
Can I?

1376
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,040
Yes.

1377
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,520
Let's go.

1378
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,640
It's easy.

1379
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,560
Let's go.

1380
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,960
This is our first group trip.

1381
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,800
Everyone.

1382
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,520
Yes.

1383
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,400
Yes.

1384
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,920
Let's go.

1385
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,760
Here we are.

1386
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,320
Let's go.

1387
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,240
The Avengers attack!

1388
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,400
Go, go, go.

1389
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,960
Snow!

1390
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,120
Don't fall.

1391
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,080
He has a unique skill.

1392
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,120
You scared me.

1393
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,360
Help me.

1394
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,520
So scary.

1395
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,840
Be careful.

1396
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,280
I can't stand a slight fall.

1397
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:28,840
Really.

1398
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,560
Brother

1399
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,200
Get lost.

1400
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,400
Slow down.

1401
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,360
The Avengers.

1402
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,520
Hua, be careful.

1403
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
It's okay.

1404
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,840
Help me.

1405
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Really hold it

1406
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,800
It's true to fall here.

1407
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,160
I...

1408
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,720
Hello, Xiao Niao.

1409
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,520
No.

1410
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,560
They are the funniest.

1411
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,120
Let me tell you.

1412
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,120
his chassis are too high.

1413
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,600
I'm so scared.

1414
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,120
My bones are crispy.

1415
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,640
Let me help you.

1416
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,760
How about this way?

1417
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,440
The snow with traces won't slide.

1418
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,000
Our Guoli

1419
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,680
You have a message.

1420
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,280
Got it?

1421
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:55,760
Yes.

1422
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,760
To members of the house.

1423
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,440
The five groups

1424
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,080
will be determined through different projects.

1425
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,360
the team with the highest points.

1426
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,080
Friendship first.

1427
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,160
No, competition first.

1428
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,320
Friendship comes first.

1429
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,520
Competition first.

1430
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,840
Friendship second.

1431
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,120
Let's set the rules first.

1432
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,520
Because if we

1433
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,560
If we battle in two pairs,

1434
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,920
there will be an extra pair.

1435
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,960
Let's do this.

1436
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

1437
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Whoever wins will be left out.

1438
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,720
If you win, you can choose to play or advance directly.

1439
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,800
Okay.

1440
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,320
Rock, paper, scissors.

1441
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

1442
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

1443
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,600
Scissors.

1444
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,320
It's okay.

1445
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,760
We won.

1446
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,720
The power of a birthday girl

1447
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,720
Drive slowly.

1448
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,200
We're not in a hurry.

1449
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,440
We don't need to win.

1450
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,960
Do you want to win?

1451
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,680
No.

1452
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,600
You can't. No.

1453
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,320
You're an athlete.

1454
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,400
How could you not want to win?

1455
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,640
I'm not strong.

1456
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,280
I'm afraid of death.

1457
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,720
I think I will win.

1458
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,240
So confident?

1459
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,040
Just kidding.

1460
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,880
Let's go faster.

1461
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,640
Slow down.

1462
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,280
Slowly.

1463
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,760
Okay.

1464
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,120
I don't want to win.

1465
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,440
Okay.

1466
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,000
Good luck, soup.

1467
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,840
Let's go.

1468
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,840
I want to go home.

1469
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,160
Trust my driving skills.

1470
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,960
You can do it.

1471
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,240
From here to here.

1472
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,320
Just one circle?

1473
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,280
One or two?

1474
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,120
Two circles.

1475
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,320
Be careful.

1476
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,880
We'll win if we get here as soon as possible.

1477
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,040
Okay, referee.

1478
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,920
Don't hit the car.

1479
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,360
Go!

1480
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,360
Go!

1481
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,760
So fierce.

1482
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,480
Wait.

1483
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,160
Good luck, Soup.

1484
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,320
I'm scared.

1485
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,480
Be careful.

1486
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,760
Mom.

1487
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,120
We won!

1488
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,240
The Avengers!

1489
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,520
Run!

1490
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,760
And drift.

1491
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,320
I just...

1492
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,160
When he started,

1493
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,480
I'll step on it to the end.

1494
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,640
Come on, get in.

1495
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,680
Let's go.

1496
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,560
To be honest, I'm scared.

1497
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,040
Ready.

1498
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,040
Go.

1499
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,760
It's a sense of rules.

1500
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,520
Let's go outside.

1501
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,000
You've really made a big circle.

1502
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,280
Make the biggest circle.

1503
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,200
Round it?

1504
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,360
We'll definitely lose if we try our best.

1505
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,280
You're right.

1506
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,080
It's really fun.

1507
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,840
This.

1508
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,360
We're overtaken.

1509
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,520
Fatty.

1510
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,720
Safety first.

1511
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,600
The road is too rough.

1512
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,240
Slow down.

1513
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,440
I think we won too easily.

1514
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,400
They're already behind.

1515
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,120
Yes.

1516
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,800
Just don't drop me.

1517
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,560
No.

1518
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,360
Victory is

1519
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,200
is easy to get.

1520
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,680
The red car is the top.

1521
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,240
Okay.

1522
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,960
It's so cold.

1523
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,440
Do we have a final round?

1524
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:55,960
Let's...

1525
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,280
The final round.

1526
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:57,840
You do it.

1527
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,760
Let's change a car.

1528
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,280
Or...

1529
01:00:59,280 --> 01:00:59,840
Okay.

1530
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,080
We decide to drive a car for the final.

1531
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,520
OK.

1532
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,640
The four of us will have a car race.

1533
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,400
Sure.

1534
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,720
Shouldn't the final be with us?

1535
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,640
Yes, the final is ours.

1536
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,640
Not yet.

1537
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,440
After the meeting,

1538
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:15,960
Okay.

1539
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,640
Let's go.

1540
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,160
Let's go.

1541
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,880
Xiao Ling, come on!

1542
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,040
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

1543
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,880
I'm afraid Xiaoling will fall out.

1544
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,280
Why does Fatty look like a big crab?

1545
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,960
Slow down.

1546
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,520
Come on, Tata.

1547
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,120
I'll go first.

1548
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,680
It's stuck.

1549
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,800
You're so strong.

1550
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,960
You're number one.

1551
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,320
The one who can't drive is the strongest.

1552
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,280
You're too strong.

1553
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,240
You drive very well.

1554
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:35,600
You know?

1555
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,960
I feel like I'm flying.

1556
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,640
is the steadiest.

1557
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,000
You're a racer.

1558
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,840
Fly like this from now on.

1559
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,160
Why are you so good?

1560
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:43,920
I don't know how to drive.

1561
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,640
That's why I'm strong.

1562
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,000
Really all-rounder, right?

1563
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,720
Come on.

1564
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,160
The final is coming.

1565
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,360
One-on-one first.

1566
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,120
Boys and boys.

1567
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,160
Girls and girls.

1568
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,440
Okay.

1569
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,200
My red horse will have to fight with you.

1570
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,280
Go!

1571
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,480
Come on.

1572
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,760
Fatty, come on.

1573
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,120
Stop flipping.

1574
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,960
Xiao Ling is so cool.

1575
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,440
Come on, the final round.

1576
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,880
Let me do it.

1577
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,640
What is this?

1578
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,400
Yu Shi versus Dilraba?

1579
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:20,760
Go.

1580
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,160
Grab your track.

1581
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,480
Where is Tae-ri?

1582
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,440
Did you go home?

1583
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,240
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

1584
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,160
Xiao Ling is really good at riding.

1585
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Amazing.

1586
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,920
I must take a photo.

1587
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,840
Awesome.

1588
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,400
Come on.

1589
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,640
We're going to win.

1590
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,400
I'm so happy.

1591
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,280
Happy.

1592
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,960
Awesome.

1593
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,920
Dilraba is better than Yu Shi.

1594
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,080
Really.

1595
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,560
This is so professional.

1596
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,120
See?

1597
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,880
What do you mean?

1598
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,840
Come to our second project.

1599
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,160
Let's go.

1600
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,160
Let's go over there.

1601
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,120
Don't fall.

1602
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:26,640
Slow down.

1603
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,200
Okay.

1604
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,240
Slide from above.

1605
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,160
The one who slips to the farthest wins.

1606
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,400
There are five tracks.

1607
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,840
Boys have a round.

1608
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,760
Then the girls have a round.

1609
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,040
and the final round.

1610
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,840
Xiaoling, I brought you a bigger one.

1611
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,880
Okay, thank you.

1612
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,440
Let me do it.

1613
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,040
I can do this.

1614
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,880
Don't fall down.

1615
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,520
Okay.

1616
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,760
I've never played this before.

1617
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,760
This must be fun.

1618
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,600
Let me help you.

1619
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,960
It's okay. Let me do it.

1620
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,800
It's okay. I can do it. Go get yours.

1621
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,440
Okay.

1622
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
Try it first.

1623
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,840
Try it first.

1624
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:11,960
Wait.

1625
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,880
Help me.

1626
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,480
Help me.

1627
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,960
Harry.

1628
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,160
I've never

1629
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,640
such a funny thing in my life.

1630
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,480
Help me!

1631
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,320
Somebody help me

1632
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,320
Come on.

1633
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,560
Try it, okay?

1634
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,320
Not bad.

1635
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,200
It won't go far.

1636
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,680
Okay, the first team is out.

1637
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:55,920
I pushed you.

1638
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,360
I pushed you to that floor. Did you see that?

1639
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,760
I'm scared. Don't do this.

1640
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,560
Okay.

1641
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,880
Hold these two sides.

1642
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,520
Tata, go.

1643
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,840
Do you want to win?

1644
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,320
No.

1645
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:08,760
Do you want to win?

1646
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,200
No.

1647
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,520
I don't want to wrestle.

1648
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,640
Harry, are you going to kick Xinxin out?

1649
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,840
I'm so scared.

1650
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,880
Are you going to shoot it?

1651
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,320
I'm scared.

1652
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,200
He's so gentle.

1653
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,480
No, I have to push harder.

1654
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,360
No, I'm scared.

1655
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,800
You didn't even debut.

1656
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,240
The track is not out.

1657
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,360
Okay, don't move. The second one.

1658
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,400
Do you hate Xinxin?

1659
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,800
She's still inside.

1660
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,920
Come on, let's...

1661
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,120
You did it ruthlessly.

1662
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,680
Yes.

1663
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,080
We seem to be the best.

1664
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,240
Hua.

1665
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,200
What do you mean?

1666
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,120
Don't move.

1667
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,240
Okay, don't move.

1668
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,600
Next.

1669
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,480
I'm ready.

1670
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,400
Why should I turn?

1671
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,280
How do I turn?

1672
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,960
Oh no, it's slanted.

1673
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,640
The curve of her track

1674
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,720
Good.

1675
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,520
We have a chance.

1676
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,160
We're in second place.

1677
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,960
As champions,

1678
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,800
we must show you

1679
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,160
I'm a little scared.

1680
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:37,720
Here.

1681
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,520
Watch your feet.

1682
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,200
She's the first and I'm the second.

1683
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,319
One, two, three.

1684
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,640
Four, five.

1685
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,520
The soup.

1686
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,080
How do I get down?

1687
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,960
I'll save me like Harry did just now.

1688
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,840
I'll push you.

1689
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,240
What?

1690
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:13,840
I'll push you.

1691
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,680
Okay.

1692
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,000
Why are you a little heavy?

1693
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:20,640
Can you move forward?

1694
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:22,840
Let's go.

1695
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:26,200
OK. Three, two, one.

1696
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,640
Why are you so slow?

1697
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,240
It's stuck.

1698
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,160
We saw you move.

1699
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:44,600
Move on your own.

1700
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,560
We saw it.

1701
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:46,840
Don't move.

1702
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,960
Cheating.

1703
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,840
Show us the face shake.

1704
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,440
Help me.

1705
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,000
You're still moving.

1706
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,040
No need.

1707
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,600
Trust me, Tata.

1708
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,560
Come on.

1709
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,360
Tata is a very serious girl

1710
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,800
and responds.

1711
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,560
She looked up immediately.

1712
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,520
The moment her heart flutters.

1713
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,440
He's so passionate.

1714
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,240
Really.

1715
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,640
Trust me, Tata.

1716
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,240
The map stood on the slope

1717
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,200
and yelled at me.

1718
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,760
He said, "Trust me, Tata."

1719
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,200
He'll do his best

1720
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,960
to make me believe that he will win the first place.

1721
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,200
His behavior touched me.

1722
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,800
Because I'm not a person

1723
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,760
who would express his emotions.

1724
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,120
I think he's cute.

1725
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,760
His legs are too long.

1726
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
You can't lie down.

1727
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,200
Go.

1728
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,920
I'll push you first.

1729
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,480
Then you push me.

1730
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,240
Okay.

1731
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,080
Come on, bro.

1732
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,480
Come on.

1733
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,080
An old man came down.

1734
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,000
Grandpa

1735
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,320
Move.

1736
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,040
Your butt.

1737
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,000
Move.

1738
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,160
More than soup.

1739
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,400
Your butt.

1740
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,640
You can't do this.

1741
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,800
It's the finale.

1742
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,160
Don't destroy the props.

1743
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,040
Let's go.

1744
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,840
Why doesn't it feel like falling?

1745
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,360
It's stuck.

1746
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,360
It's stuck.

1747
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,120
Okay.

1748
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,600
The map.

1749
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,640
Drawing! Drawing!

1750
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,200
He's using his hands.

1751
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,920
Good, second.

1752
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,400
Good.

1753
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,400
You can use your hands.

1754
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,640
You've voted for him.

1755
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,680
You're not as fast as him.

1756
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,200
Who's the first?

1757
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:54,880
You were the first.

1758
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,600
I was the first.

1759
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,000
She was the first and I was the second.

1760
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,640
We are the third.

1761
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,680
They should be number one.

1762
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,000
They always get the first place.

1763
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,480
Trust me, Tata.

1764
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,600
Right?

1765
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,200
So passionate.

1766
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,040
The boys will announce their scores.

1767
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,760
Three points for our team.

1768
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,280
Awesome.

1769
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,920
I think I can feel

1770
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,920
what I feel

1771
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,880
more joy.

1772
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,240
Because we just focus on playing.

1773
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,440
We had fun.

1774
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,240
This is what I feel the most.

1775
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,200
Harry.

1776
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,440
Five points.

1777
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,240
I think he did a good job

1778
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,920
in the sports day.

1779
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,440
And he's very considerate.

1780
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,600
He's been blocking the wind by my side.

1781
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,560
Our team got five points too.

1782
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,760
Awesome.

1783
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,680
I think there will be sparks

1784
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,000
I think there will be sparks.

1785
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Because we are

1786
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,640
moving forward for the same goal.

1787
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,240
And we went up to get the tires together.

1788
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,920
He's afraid I can't carry it.

1789
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,680
He will take the initiative to carry two hands.

1790
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,640
Like this.

1791
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,640
Five points.

1792
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,080
He's quite careful with the soup.

1793
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,520
Because today's ice noodles are slippery,

1794
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,480
as long as I'm walking,

1795
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,080
he kept reminding me

1796
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,400
to be careful not to fall.

1797
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,600
When I fell down,

1798
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,680
when I fell down.

1799
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,560
I think

1800
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,800
he's quite considerate.

1801
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,640
Nine points for our team.

1802
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,360
The winner today is Tata.

1803
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,040
or the map?

1804
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,680
No, we worked together.

1805
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,920
I'm very happy.

1806
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,240
Because I think

1807
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,960
work together.

1808
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,240
We did a great job.

1809
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:37,800
Thank you.

1810
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,640
This is the first time I've played ice-cream.

1811
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,320
I feel very fresh.

1812
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,520
And with the drawing,

1813
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,360
He worked so hard

1814
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,920
to win the first place.

1815
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,120
The whole process was very fun.

1816
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,760
The winner gets the mission card.

1817
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:55,600
Congratulations.

1818
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,200
You're the most valuable team member

1819
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,960
of winter festival.

1820
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,040
You'll become the king of the little house.

1821
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,400
and enjoy two liters of clothes.

1822
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,640
A sip of fruit juice wine.

1823
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,240
You can appoint a male member

1824
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,360
to make a non-date request.

1825
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,280
You can't refuse the designated ones.

1826
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,880
Invite him to lift the fruit jar together

1827
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,120
and complete the assignment.

1828
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,760
The designated ones

1829
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,080
needs to complete the requirements within 12 hours.

1830
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,320
I've decided to give this yuzu-flavored fruit jar

1831
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,520
to

1832
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,280
A map.

1833
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,320
You worked too hard, right?

1834
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,960
Yes, Tu is tired today.

1835
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,840
Yes.

1836
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,200
I'll think about

1837
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,720
I'll think about it and tell you.

1838
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,280
Okay.

1839
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,160
Let's take a photo together.

1840
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,720
One, two, three.

1841
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,240
I'm so happy. I'm back.

1842
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,440
We're finally here.

1843
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,560
We're home.

1844
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,520
I caught a wild one today.

1845
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,400
Slow down.

1846
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,840
I caught a wild girl today.

1847
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,680
It's so comfortable at home.

1848
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,160
Where is my little kitty?

1849
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,680
Mimi.

1850
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,440
Have you lost weight?

1851
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,120
You look

1852
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,000
You've lost weight. I think it's eaten too much.

1853
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,080
I'm going down.

1854
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,280
Okay.

1855
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,720
Do you want it?

1856
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,560
No.

1857
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,280
I'm going to eat dinner later.

1858
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,320
She's going to cook noodles later.

1859
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,800
It's our turn today.

1860
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,200
Yes.

1861
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,040
When I came back,

1862
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,480
The floor was slippery.

1863
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,080
I almost fell over there.

1864
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,440
Then he came to catch me.

1865
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,240
I did stand firm.

1866
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,280
He fell down.

1867
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:47,800
Soup?

1868
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,560
He...

1869
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,560
Then he asked me to cook him a bowl of noodles.

1870
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,760
Then I said, "I'll eat a bowl of noodles."

1871
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,240
She told me that's all you can do.

1872
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,040
Are you hungry?

1873
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,000
I'm fine.

1874
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,360
You're not hungry?

1875
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,960
I didn't eat this morning.

1876
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,160
I think I can eat this bowl of noodles now.

1877
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,240
I'll cook it now.

1878
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,520
Anyone wants instant noodles?

1879
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,360
Are you going to make instant noodles?

1880
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,240
Me too.

1881
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,440
Do you want some? I'll cook for you.

1882
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,760
Why would he cook for me?

1883
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,120
Harry cooked it for me.

1884
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,800
So I made two packs.

1885
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,640
I'll cook for someone.

1886
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,360
Cook for Xinxin.

1887
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,400
No, Tu and Xinxin.

1888
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,000
I'll cook for them. I don't want to eat.

1889
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,680
You're betrayed.

1890
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,880
No, I'm not eating.

1891
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,760
I'm just doing you a favor.

1892
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,320
It seems to be unstable.

1893
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,600
Yes, it's a bit unstable.

1894
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,880
I'll do it. You go.

1895
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,600
You have to live up to your bottom.

1896
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,240
I am.

1897
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,200
I think if you don't cook well,

1898
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,880
I feel sorry for it.

1899
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,280
Not only that,

1900
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,240
but also your stomach.

1901
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,160
Yes.

1902
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,040
Why is someone cooking with sunglasses on?

1903
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,120
Take it off.

1904
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,440
Cool.

1905
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,280
Unfortunately, the person I want to show is not here.

1906
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,760
I'm hungry.

1907
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,000
Xin, what would you like to add?

1908
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,240
What?

1909
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,080
Did you cook it for me?

1910
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,520
We're helping you.

1911
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,680
Can't you tell?

1912
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,320
No.

1913
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,840
It's hard for you, right?

1914
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,400
Let me tell you.

1915
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,320
People need to grow in training.

1916
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,760
Is it mine?

1917
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,400
There's a map.

1918
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,360
is not the only one.

1919
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,440
Eat them all.

1920
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,840
This is delicious.

1921
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,000
Eat this first

1922
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,480
Is the noodles ready?

1923
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,720
I'll eat a little.

1924
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,760
Then...

1925
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:04,760
Map.

1926
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,520
Give some to Susu.

1927
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,560
Okay, I got it.

1928
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,320
I can't eat that much.

1929
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,760
Let's put it on first.

1930
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,520
Okay.

1931
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,240
Whose bowl is this?

1932
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,160
Yours.

1933
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,120
So many.

1934
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,160
Thank you, Chef.

1935
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,600
Ling'er, why do you have such a big bowl?

1936
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
Fatty got it for me.

1937
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,200
Who cooked this for you?

1938
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,160
Fatty.

1939
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,960
He's afraid she can't eat enough.

1940
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,840
Tu.

1941
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,880
Hurry.

1942
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,320
Wait. Let go.

1943
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,560
Give this to Tata.

1944
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,960
I'll cook it for you.

1945
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,200
Excuse me.

1946
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,720
Let Tata eat first.

1947
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,880
I'll cook it.

1948
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,000
Tata.

1949
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,520
Who's calling me?

1950
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,440
Do you want noodles?

1951
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,440
Put it on first.

1952
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,360
No.

1953
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,480
I don't need it now.

1954
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,600
No, I have to go out later.

1955
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,560
You're going out?

1956
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,600
Have a bite.

1957
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,640
It's ready.

1958
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:21,920
Really?

1959
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,320
Yes.

1960
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:22,720
Okay.

1961
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,720
Harry and others just made it. You eat first.

1962
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:35,760
What about you?

1963
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,440
You gave it to someone else.

1964
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,040
I did.

1965
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,040
Don't ask me to cook for you anymore.

1966
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,040
What's wrong?

1967
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,040
My heart was broken.

1968
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,680
I cooked for him and he gave it to someone else.

1969
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,320
He gave it to Tata.

1970
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,960
He borrowed the flowers to offer Buddha.

1971
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,880
What do you want? You eat hang noodles.

1972
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,560
I want to eat more.

1973
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,480
Don't.

1974
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,560
Let's have dinner later.

1975
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,840
I want to eat too.

1976
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,160
Okay.

1977
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,160
Just say it doesn't taste good.

1978
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,200
It's okay.

1979
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,120
I'm not full.

1980
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,720
Here.

1981
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,480
Don't feed Xiao Ling too much tonight.

1982
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,240
Call Terri.

1983
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,720
Go get him. It'll get soggy.

1984
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,960
Tae-seo.

1985
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:29,880
I cooked yours.

1986
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,440
I cooked yours. Have a bite.

1987
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,320
Eat.

1988
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,040
It's not spicy.

1989
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,640
Yes.

1990
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:34,800
Sure.

1991
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,560
Is it good, Xiao Ling?

1992
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,400
Yes.

1993
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,520
Is Tae-ri good?

1994
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:44,880
It's good.

1995
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,680
It's so delicious.

1996
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Can we play games? Is there enough people?

1997
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:54,760
Yes.

1998
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,800
Just the six of us?

1999
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,520
Yes, only six left.

2000
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,080
What about the others?

2001
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,320
A date with Cupid?

2002
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,920
Really?

2003
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,400
Yes.

2004
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,760
Susu went out to get changed.

2005
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,160
No.

2006
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,680
She's definitely not going on a date.

2007
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,640
It's just...

2008
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,720
Because she

2009
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,160
She didn't wear that dress a few days ago.

2010
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,160
No wonder you don't eat.

2011
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,280
Yes.

2012
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,840
They are in a hurry for dinner.

2013
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,360
Yes.

2014
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,840
They started this date.

2015
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,560
So, Tata will...

2016
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,400
Tata is going.

2017
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,040
Tata went to

2018
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:28,520
Tae-ri left.

2019
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,480
I'm so stupid.

2020
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,920
I even forced others to eat noodles.

2021
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,440
Yes.

2022
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,080
I even gave it to others.

2023
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,840
No wonder they said they weren't hungry.

2024
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,480
So Harry left too.

2025
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,880
He went on a date.

2026
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,360
Yes.

2027
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,160
Are you sad?

2028
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,480
Are you sad?

2029
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,120
Why would I be sad?

2030
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,080
I can go on a date too.

2031
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,800
No one asked me out.

2032
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,920
They all went out.

2033
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,760
Maybe not yet.

2034
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,800
I'll go take a look.

2035
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,080
I...

2036
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,360
I'm outside.

2037
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,200
What are you doing?

2038
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,600
Are you going out?

2039
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,280
Yes.

2040
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,400
Okay.

2041
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,720
We won't have dinner tonight.

2042
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,000
We have to.

2043
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,760
No.

2044
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,720
Didn't you go out for dinner?

2045
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,200
Just like

2046
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,360
when I was rejected this afternoon.

2047
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,280
It's complicated.

2048
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,520
Because she doesn't know me.

2049
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,920
Maybe she knows soup better.

2050
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,800
They moved in a few days earlier than us.

2051
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,480
I want to change my impression

2052
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,880
to change her impression of me.

2053
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,640
Good evening.

2054
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,280
Good evening.

2055
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:16,920
Have a seat.

2056
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,360
Okay.

2057
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,760
How is it?

2058
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,560
Are you surprised?

2059
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,720
It was an accident at first.

2060
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,240
Really?

2061
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,960
Yes very

2062
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,560
Yes.

2063
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,920
Because I might have something

2064
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,840
I think

2065
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,520
more words.

2066
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:41,600
Yes.

2067
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,680
Yes, the first time I entered the house,

2068
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,200
Right?

2069
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,440
Because at that time,

2070
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,800
When you came,

2071
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,800
my wisdom tooth was inflamed.

2072
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,920
I have a toothache. I don't want to talk.

2073
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,120
Yes.

2074
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:56,520
I thought you were quiet.

2075
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,400
Is today your second date?

2076
01:24:59,400 --> 01:24:59,880
Right?

2077
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,600
Yes.

2078
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:00,920
Yes.

2079
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,960
How did you know?

2080
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,840
Because when we entered the room,

2081
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,640
everyone said

2082
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,440
the first time a girl chose a boy.

2083
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,440
Yes.

2084
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,320
And...

2085
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,560
I want to know

2086
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,120
Is it the same person you want?

2087
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,120
You don't have to say anyone.

2088
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:17,920
Yes.

2089
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,560
Okay, got it.

2090
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,360
It's a coincidence.

2091
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,680
But you didn't guess

2092
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,920
Harry is Xin's (brother).

2093
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,280
When I first moved in,

2094
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,880
they kept talking.

2095
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,440
Then Xinxin felt

2096
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,920
when talking to Harry,

2097
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,960
She's very oppressive.

2098
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,120
So you were very sure.

2099
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,320
Yes, I was very sure.

2100
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,560
You thought you were too smart.

2101
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,320
Yes, I think I'm too smart.

2102
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,200
Because you don't talk and sit next to me.

2103
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,560
How do you want me to guess?

2104
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,880
I'll be the first to exclude you.

2105
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,800
I'm introverted.

2106
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,440
Me too.

2107
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,640
So you're always passive.

2108
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,880
Thank you.

2109
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,840
Whether it's a relationship

2110
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,760
or in daily life,

2111
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,480
are passive.

2112
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,560
If I can feel

2113
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:34,120
a very determined choice,

2114
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,720
I will walk towards him.

2115
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,040
But if I feel

2116
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:39,960
and he walks,

2117
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,280
10, 20, 30.

2118
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,760
I can be indifferent. Yeah.

2119
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,160
Almost the same. Me too.

2120
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,320
I'm usually passive.

2121
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,920
And

2122
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,360
they might give me some signals.

2123
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,560
I might

2124
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:56,880
We're just friends, right?

2125
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,920
Me too. Yes.

2126
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,840
Yes mutual

2127
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,400
He said the soup yesterday

2128
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,160
He was also

2129
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,320
passive.

2130
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:10,720
Yes.

2131
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:14,160
When they asked me about my first impression,

2132
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,280
he gave me five.

2133
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,960
I thought it was.

2134
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,360
I was passive when I was in a relationship.

2135
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,480
And he said

2136
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,760
I thought it was because of this. Give me five.

2137
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,560
And then

2138
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,880
I said you were the first.

2139
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,600
Then he explained

2140
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,680
and explained.

2141
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,000
Yes.

2142
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,640
He said he was clapping for this reason.

2143
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,680
Are you embarrassed?

2144
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,440
I'm fine.

2145
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,480
Then we...

2146
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,960
to compete fairly.

2147
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,120
I think boys

2148
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,000
Just say whatever you want.

2149
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,840
There's no need to be embarrassed.

2150
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,480
Because I'll return it to you today.

2151
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,400
I was really torn about

2152
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,240
Why?

2153
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,360
So I always

2154
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,200
to the end,

2155
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,400
I made the choice.

2156
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,160
Someone told me on our way there today

2157
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,000
I gave you the soup first.

2158
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,800
Yes.

2159
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,920
Do you really think so?

2160
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,720
Yes.

2161
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,120
Well,

2162
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:15,960
Maybe I was busy

2163
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,960
so I didn't deliver the soup fast.

2164
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,080
Yes.

2165
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,760
But

2166
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,920
I didn't expect you to send it to me.

2167
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,480
Because you can't remember my name.

2168
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:33,560
I'm sorry.

2169
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,480
Everyone except me remembers it.

2170
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,720
I thought

2171
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:41,240
I'm sorry.

2172
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,240
It's okay.

2173
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,200
So you really forgot.

2174
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,360
I really forgot.

2175
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,640
The brain crashed.

2176
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,360
Really crashed

2177
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,200
I really forgot

2178
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,120
Everyone's name

2179
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,480
There are too many names.

2180
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,480
I was thinking

2181
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,720
Is it AA or BB or CC?

2182
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,240
I don't remember either.

2183
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,240
Because I may

2184
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm a little avoided.

2185
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:03,800
and avoided.

2186
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,280
The more I care,

2187
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,680
the less I feel.

2188
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,640
Yes.

2189
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,320
My best friend is Gemini.

2190
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:12,880
She said

2191
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,480
it's really hard to talk to you.

2192
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,600
I don't want to talk to you.

2193
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,040
You're so boring.

2194
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,560
My friend kept saying that I was boring.

2195
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,280
And then

2196
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,120
when I introduced myself,

2197
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:23,680
I said,

2198
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,440
I think I'm a boring person.

2199
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,560
I'm also a boring person.

2200
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,080
But I'm very confident.

2201
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,880
I always find things to do at home.

2202
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,840
Even if I open a package,

2203
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,680
is my way of self-destruction.

2204
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:34,640
Do you know how exaggerated

2205
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,120
in New York?

2206
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,120
I just went there.

2207
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,400
I had no friends.

2208
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,520
I was so exaggerated that I found a cafe

2209
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,230
I sat there all afternoon watching people.

2210
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,240
So many people come and go.

2211
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,150
Loneliness.

2212
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:45,560
No.

2213
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,480
I can't stand this loneliness.

2214
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,830
I never eat alone.

2215
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:49,560
But I can't

2216
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,960
be alone in the same environment.

2217
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,350
If I see

2218
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,920
see others there,

2219
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,880
I feel much better.

2220
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,280
I can't stay at home alone.

2221
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,960
I really need someone

2222
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,960
who needs company.

2223
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,270
Yes, you don't have to say anything.

2224
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,640
But I need someone to arrange things.

2225
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:07,230
I have to ask him out if no one asks me out.

2226
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,920
All right.

2227
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,720
What are you doing today?

2228
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,400
What are you doing tomorrow? What are you doing tonight?

2229
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,520
Yes.

2230
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,070
What do you want to do?

2231
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:16,120
Do you want to come to my house?

2232
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,240
Yes.

2233
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,320
All right.

2234
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,750
After the overall chat,

2235
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,920
we are similar.

2236
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:25,680
Similar.

2237
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,350
We have a lot to talk about today.

2238
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:29,150
Our chat

2239
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:31,710
in a relaxing way.

2240
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,600
They had a good chat.

2241
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:36,880
I'm curious

2242
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,960
the last time you had a date with Cupid,

2243
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,160
when you went on a date last time?

2244
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,120
Or will it be dry?

2245
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,680
I'm trying my best to get to the point.

2246
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,600
So today, I'm looking for...

2247
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,240
No.

2248
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,960
I responded very actively.

2249
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,480
When I knew

2250
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,470
she was the one

2251
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:55,160
when she was looking for the topic.

2252
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,000
I'm actually

2253
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,640
in my heart.

2254
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,390
Because today,

2255
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,830
she said she was a passive person.

2256
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,320
Since she's willing to make soup,

2257
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,190
she took the initiative to talk about it.

2258
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:05,720
And to me,

2259
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,280
I'm looking for the topic.

2260
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,990
I feel a gap.

2261
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:14,750
Let's play a game.

2262
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,760
Okay.

2263
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,240
Do you like that girl now?

2264
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,800
Do you think she's older than you?

2265
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,120
I think I like her type.

2266
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,200
She has more looks.

2267
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,680
But it's usually very important

2268
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,520
at first sight.

2269
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,760
Did you have fun with Tata today?

2270
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,160
Yes.

2271
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,200
So Tata is the girl

2272
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,920
you would like at first sight?

2273
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,360
I think so.

2274
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,960
if the person you like

2275
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,430
her feelings have changed,

2276
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,440
will you continue to express your feelings to her

2277
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,790
or change it right away?

2278
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,600
I'll try my best.

2279
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,750
But

2280
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:01,080
I just want to fight for it.

2281
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,440
or try your best.

2282
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,400
I think

2283
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:22,590
I think with the speed of this house,

2284
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:24,670
two to three days

2285
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,040
in two to three days.

2286
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,190
It's the first time I've heard the fluid description

2287
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:33,790
This house feels like it's only for one day

2288
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,800
like ten days outside.

2289
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:36,440
Yes.

2290
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,200
What if both sides are responding?

2291
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,040
I think it might not be two or three days.

2292
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,350
Then maybe stretch back a little.

2293
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,800
When she accepts two people,

2294
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,600
when she accepts two people.

2295
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,520
No, I think she has the right

2296
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,280
to meet more people.

2297
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:53,920
It's her.

2298
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,710
It's like being alone in the house.

2299
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,310
Time passes slowly.

2300
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,880
I only have one thing for him.

2301
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,800
My first impression was

2302
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,120
I had a good eye.

2303
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:41,720
I just want to

2304
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,920
get to know each other more.

2305
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:57,840
Good evening.

2306
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:59,550
Good morning.

2307
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,480
Good morning.

2308
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,320
We meet again

2309
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,560
We meet again.

2310
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,110
Do you know I'm on a date with you today?

2311
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:11,120
I know.

2312
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,840
How do you know?

2313
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,600
Because there's only

2314
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:15,520
Tae-ri and you.

2315
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,760
Then I can't go on a date with Tae-seo.

2316
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,360
Is it for me?

2317
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,600
Really?

2318
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,640
You're...

2319
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,240
Because you have a Cupid date.

2320
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,480
It's a letter from your brother.

2321
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
I was the kind of person

2322
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,150
by you

2323
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:42,750
Or did you just want to

2324
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:43,710
I guessed.

2325
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:44,720
Here.

2326
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,320
Susu.

2327
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,200
Okay.

2328
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:11,920
Let's eat.

2329
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:18,840
Who did you date the other day?

2330
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,870
Can I ask that?

2331
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:20,510
Sure, no problem.

2332
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,120
I can tell you.

2333
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:21,920
Who did you meet?

2334
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,520
Xiao Ling.

2335
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:27,480
It's also a date.

2336
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,760
It's like having dinner with friends.

2337
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,480
I said I found my confidant.

2338
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,160
Yes.

2339
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:31,920
Yes.

2340
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,520
So can you eat spicy food?

2341
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,190
I can eat spicy food.

2342
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:40,830
Yes.

2343
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,880
Did I really remember it wrong?

2344
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,760
You really remember it wrong.

2345
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,600
I didn't order spicy food today.

2346
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,800
I don't know what to say now.

2347
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,000
This is the first time I feel I can't answer the phone.

2348
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,400
You know?

2349
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,720
What is this?

2350
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,120
This is melon powder.

2351
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,480
Wait.

2352
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,000
Do you need help?

2353
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:11,760
Then you do it.

2354
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:19,390
No, I can't.

2355
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:20,160
I really can't.

2356
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,120
Wait.

2357
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,240
Are you really from the north?

2358
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,230
What do you mean?

2359
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,350
What are you doing?

2360
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,320
Because there's a difference between the South and the North.

2361
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,070
Really?

2362
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:47,800
Look.

2363
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,910
I put the bowl on the plate.

2364
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,510
This is the bone disc.

2365
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,960
But you put it in the vegetable.

2366
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,000
It's okay.

2367
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,870
No.

2368
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:00,760
So what?

2369
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,440
No, I can.

2370
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,240
So what?

2371
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:02,840
Yeah.

2372
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,600
Let's talk.

2373
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,240
Why did you

2374
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,440
the invitation card today?

2375
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:08,920
Xin.

2376
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,200
Can I have some water?

2377
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,880
Why are you nervous?

2378
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,560
I want some water.

2379
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,390
My mouth is a little dry.

2380
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,120
It's hot.

2381
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,040
It's hot.

2382
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:51,960
Tell me.

2383
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:56,000
I feel like I've been tricked.

2384
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,680
Let me ask you a question.

2385
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,680
Do you think love at first sight

2386
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,440
is love at first sight?

2387
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:03,920
Will you choose

2388
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,590
or will you choose to fall in love as time goes by?

2389
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,200
Actually, I believe in love at first sight.

2390
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,190
But I can also accept love that grows over time.

2391
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,360
Because we are slightly opposite.

2392
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:22,910
Because I just think

2393
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:24,510
if it's love at first sight,

2394
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:25,400
it could be

2395
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,320
a little bit.

2396
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,200
or because of her skin.

2397
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,800
I think for a boy,

2398
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,840
to a man.

2399
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,480
Shallow.

2400
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,070
Li Ronghao: You're like this. Li Ronghao: You're like this.

2401
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,800
If we don't get along,

2402
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,390
if you don't get along with each other,

2403
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,630
I don't respect you and others.

2404
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,640
So

2405
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,080
to get to know her.

2406
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,800
Right? That's what it means.

2407
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,160
Yes.

2408
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,720
After all, we've been together longer.

2409
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,310
Actually, I thought you and Xinxin

2410
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,200
were siblings.

2411
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,550
Because yesterday,

2412
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:56,720
didn't lie to me once.

2413
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,600
I hesitated.

2414
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,400
I'm a fool.

2415
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:01,280
Yes.

2416
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,960
In the end,

2417
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,840
Susu.

2418
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,280
is quite smart.

2419
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:05,760
But

2420
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,800
I saw you two

2421
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,030
with each other yesterday.

2422
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:09,470
I'm familiar with everyone.

2423
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:12,920
I'm familiar with everyone.

2424
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:13,790
Don't you think so?

2425
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,680
Are we close?

2426
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,280
Are we close?

2427
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:20,670
Okay, it's fine.

2428
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:21,920
Try to get familiar with each other after this meal.

2429
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,480
and be more familiar with each other.

2430
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:30,360
Okay.

2431
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,400
Today,

2432
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,550
I can't catch up with what you said.

2433
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:41,080
What do you think

2434
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,430
what kind of person do you think I am?

2435
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,080
I think you are

2436
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,040
a passive person.

2437
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,760
And I think

2438
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,280
If you like someone,

2439
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,520
if you like someone.

2440
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,150
Look at one more person.

2441
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:58,200
If you like someone,

2442
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,680
when you like someone.

2443
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,470
subconsciously.

2444
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,920
I need to think about what you said.

2445
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,760
Is it like this?

2446
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:07,040
I think

2447
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,030
in this aspect.

2448
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:10,200
I was really passive.

2449
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,480
Because he felt

2450
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,640
So he's been trying to be positive.

2451
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,120
to talk to me.

2452
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,880
Do you think your other half

2453
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,480
are complementary or similar?

2454
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,310
Do you think it's better?

2455
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:26,560
better?

2456
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,510
It's the same as asking me this question.

2457
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,630
Because I am

2458
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,920
who can change with my other half.

2459
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,790
You think you can change yourself?

2460
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:35,040
I think I can change.

2461
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,800
I think boys can change.

2462
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:37,880
No.

2463
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,440
It's hard to change your personality.

2464
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,040
If you really like someone,

2465
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,480
why don't you change it?

2466
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,440
I have to change it if it doesn't suit me.

2467
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,120
Am I wrong?

2468
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,880
You won't.

2469
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:52,990
I think

2470
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:53,840
a lot.

2471
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,550
This will change as the other person does.

2472
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,310
In this case,

2473
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,310
which is the real me?

2474
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,910
Do you think our current state

2475
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:08,510
is the same as my state in the room?

2476
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,590
Not really.

2477
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,720
Which one do you think is the real me?

2478
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,040
A little house.

2479
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,840
The one in the small house is more relaxed, right?

2480
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:19,520
To be precise,

2481
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,800
You're stressed now, right?

2482
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,400
A little.

2483
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,880
How should I put it? It's the same frequency.

2484
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,870
I think

2485
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,880
complementary

2486
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,870
It's not that absolute.

2487
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,360
It depends on the details.

2488
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,510
personality or hobby.

2489
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,590
Do you think it's a hobby that requires frequency?

2490
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:39,160
But I think

2491
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,830
it's better to complement each other.

2492
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:41,680
Personality complementary.

2493
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,640
I think we should have the same hobby.

2494
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,760
Yes.

2495
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,440
Surprisingly, he said

2496
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,080
he would change himself

2497
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,040
because of his personality.

2498
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,440
I think

2499
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,120
is

2500
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:54,640
to me.

2501
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,350
When I hear this answer,

2502
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:58,880
I would feel happier.

2503
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,710
Can I apply for clothes?

2504
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,200
What kind of boy do you like?

2505
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,230
A more delicate boy.

2506
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:21,200
He's gentle.

2507
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:23,520
That's all.

2508
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:24,990
This is very important.

2509
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,520
Personality is very important.

2510
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,360
I think

2511
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,200
meticulous,

2512
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:32,440
in some details.

2513
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,880
and have a good temper.

2514
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,880
You must have a good temper.

2515
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,310
Because in love,

2516
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:38,880
in love.

2517
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,840
Do you think I have a good temper?

2518
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,870
I should have a little temper.

2519
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:53,040
I have a little temper.

2520
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,270
I think

2521
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,190
you will lose your temper.

2522
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,600
It's not that you don't have a temper at all.

2523
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,000
I have no temper at all.

2524
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,600
Seriously?

2525
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,840
I'm very easy-going.

2526
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,640
I really have no temper.

2527
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,680
If I had a temper,

2528
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,160
I would hold it back.

2529
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,920
I'll be exhausted.

2530
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:11,390
But only in front of strangers

2531
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,830
in front of strangers.

2532
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,200
No, I don't know people I know either.

2533
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,120
If I'm in a relationship, I'll say...

2534
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:16,480
How about this?

2535
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,000
Give me a few days to calm down.

2536
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,520
I'll talk to her after I calm down.

2537
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,760
Can I call it a cold war?

2538
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,830
Calm doesn't mean you don't reply to my texts.

2539
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:29,880
Yes.

2540
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,400
It's you.

2541
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,200
Calm down.

2542
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:32,640
I won't discuss

2543
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,520
or discuss the truth with her.

2544
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,680
Let's put this problem aside.

2545
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,550
Yes, put it down first.

2546
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:36,640
It must have put it in.

2547
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,110
It won't take more than an hour.

2548
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:40,720
Then I'll come back

2549
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,680
to deal with this.

2550
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,840
I won't fight with anyone.

2551
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:47,760
Aren't you bored?

2552
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,830
Aren't you

2553
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,640
very boring.

2554
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,160
What's wrong?

2555
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,400
You're so dull.

2556
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,200
Right?

2557
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,360
Silly.

2558
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,030
Shallow, right?

2559
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:57,120
Shallow.

2560
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,200
I don't usually

2561
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,240
I seldom set up a party

2562
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,120
or ask someone out for fun.

2563
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:03,840
But if you call me,

2564
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,560
I'll go there basically.

2565
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,760
Okay, let me ask you

2566
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,160
what kind of girl do you like?

2567
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,720
I think

2568
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,480
if that girl

2569
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,440
a quiet girl,

2570
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,470
I'll take the initiative.

2571
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:22,080
If that girl

2572
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,000
is a proactive girl,

2573
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,510
I'll listen to her a little bit.

2574
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:26,430
Now there's a quiet girl

2575
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:28,350
and a proactive girl.

2576
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:28,990
You...

2577
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:33,440
You really...

2578
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:38,480
Who do you want to know more?

2579
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,360
If I have to choose,

2580
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,230
I would choose

2581
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:44,440
a quiet girl.

2582
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,440
Be quiet.

2583
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,070
Okay.

2584
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,720
I feel that

2585
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,280
a little rebellious

2586
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,960
in life.

2587
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,200
That's a little different from me.

2588
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,990
I follow the rules.

2589
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:15,520
He's a little naughty.

2590
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,360
I'm just a little worried.

2591
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,880
during the conversation tonight,

2592
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,240
will my passive

2593
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,790
will cause him trouble.

2594
01:46:21,790 --> 01:46:23,360
But he chose

2595
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,150
He said to be quiet.

2596
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:27,390
to be quiet.

2597
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,440
After meeting Tata today,

2598
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,960
more cheerful and cheerful than before.

2599
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,400
and talk more.

2600
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,400
I think her feelings

2601
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,760
and life.

2602
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,350
might overlap with my thoughts.

2603
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:45,920
and more frequent.

2604
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,040
such a Cupid date.

2605
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,320
I think the first one is more like

2606
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,480
Like how we get along with Xiaoling as friends.

2607
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,710
Second, she just

2608
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:53,200
really like someone.

2609
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,280
I want to know more

2610
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:57,150
and chat.

2611
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,190
I'm having a hard time right now.

2612
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,240
Do you have someone you want to post today?

2613
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:21,920
Just follow your heart.

2614
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,670
My heart is a mess right now.

2615
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:29,630
I just feel

2616
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:31,440
I'm with Hua.

2617
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,080
Like

2618
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,560
when I'm with Xiaoling.

2619
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,870
Do you think...

2620
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:36,880
I think you and Xiaoling

2621
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,800
with Xiaoling,

2622
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:41,120
I don't feel that intimacy.

2623
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,030
It's not in the same picture.

2624
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,440
Don't think too much.

2625
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,760
At this moment,

2626
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,440
who do you think you're getting along with?

2627
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
I'll definitely send it to Xiaoling today.

2628
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,030
Don't talk about others. Who do you want to send it to?

2629
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:00,990
That's good.

2630
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:06,750
So you and Harry are like this.

2631
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,280
Do you think he'll be shaken?

2632
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:13,120
Maybe.

2633
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,680
Do you think he'll give it to me today?

2634
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:16,080
I think he will.

2635
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:17,280
If he didn't give it to me,

2636
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,240
I would cry.

2637
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,550
I'll be the first one

2638
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,720
I'll give it to him even if he doesn't give it to me.

2639
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,720
So who will you text today?

2640
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,280
Tonight?

2641
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:33,520
I have to tell you that too.

2642
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,430
Who will you send it to?

2643
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:42,960
Not telling me?

2644
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,480
Or do you want to hesitate?

2645
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,560
I'll tell you.

2646
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,040
Who are you sending it to?

2647
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,030
I won't tell you.

2648
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,920
If you don't tell me,

2649
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,680
I'll tell you if you tell me.

2650
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:51,870
Just tell me.

2651
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,520
I won't tell you.

2652
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:55,520
Can I ask you

2653
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,200
who did you send it to two days ago?

2654
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:07,600
I sent it to Xinxin on the first day.

2655
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,640
and sent it to Xiaoling the next day.

2656
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,680
I went on a date with her.

2657
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:10,480
and said it clearly.

2658
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,080
I said thank you.

2659
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:12,990
You didn't make me embarrassed.

2660
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:13,630
My friend.

2661
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,030
But you made me feel awkward today.

2662
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:20,830
What?

2663
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:22,640
When I gave you the invitation card,

2664
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,520
you asked me why I gave it to you.

2665
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,880
Why do you want it?

2666
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,320
I didn't.

2667
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,520
You did.

2668
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,080
Why did you tell me when I gave it to you?

2669
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,400
Really?

2670
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,000
Yes.

2671
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,760
Because you've invited someone else,

2672
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,430
you probably didn't expect me to invite you.

2673
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:36,350
Why are you giving it to me?

2674
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,950
I invited you.

2675
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,040
I was so surprised that you wanted to

2676
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,640
Why?

2677
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,350
Because of me.

2678
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:45,520
Because of you.

2679
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,320
I can understand your text.

2680
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,280
Actually,

2681
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,270
Choose one of the three

2682
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:51,000
But

2683
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
who excluded me

2684
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:57,600
who was excluded.

2685
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,040
I had no choice.

2686
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,280
What's wrong?

2687
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:05,920
Right?

2688
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,600
Speaking of which, right?

2689
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,190
No.

2690
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:08,670
Suddenly.

2691
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:09,950
I thought it was thundering.

2692
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:11,440
A "wo" sound.

2693
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:13,680
No.

2694
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:14,680
No?

2695
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,430
I told you. You're funny, right?

2696
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,640
Good words, bad words.

2697
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,480
Good words.

2698
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,280
Isn't that good?

2699
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,790
Great.

2700
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:27,710
You said I was dull and I said you were funny.

2701
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:29,400
You listen to me.

2702
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:35,230
If you say so, I'll...

2703
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:36,480
with high EQ.

2704
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,830
We can complement each other.

2705
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:46,880
Right?

2706
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,560
You don't even say that.

2707
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,080
He didn't say anything.

2708
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,040
What's wrong?

2709
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,160
You're so dull.

2710
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,040
Just wait.

2711
01:50:58,430 --> 01:50:59,320
Then what are you?

2712
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:01,400
I'm Big Bull.

2713
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,000
Think about it.

2714
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,110
You don't have to talk.

2715
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:07,280
I'm not embarrassed now.

2716
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:08,670
Aren't you embarrassed now?

2717
01:51:08,670 --> 01:51:09,280
You are.

2718
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,520
No.

2719
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:11,960
Then why do you keep

2720
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:13,150
want to talk?

2721
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,560
Then I'll stop.

2722
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,230
Say it.

2723
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:15,960
Then I'll stop.

2724
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,480
Say it.

2725
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:25,080
So cold.

2726
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:33,920
So quiet.

2727
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,400
Who is this

2728
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,400
Looking at men or women

2729
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:40,960
Good evening.

2730
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:42,840
Good evening.

2731
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,000
Why are there only four of you?

2732
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,320
Do you want to join us?

2733
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,310
Get changed first.

2734
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,680
Good evening.

2735
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,520
Do you want taco?

2736
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,030
What?

2737
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:32,510
Taco.

2738
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:33,120
I'm not eating.

2739
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:33,880
Eat later.

2740
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:34,880
You guys eat first.

2741
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,240
I just woke up.

2742
01:52:38,910 --> 01:52:39,360
Oh no.

2743
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:39,920
It's too hot.

2744
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:41,150
It's too hot.

2745
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:14,560
It's hot.

2746
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,870
The microwave is a bit strong.

2747
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,880
Why is my first reaction dodging?

2748
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,160
I was afraid I might splash on you.

2749
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,400
A man should protect himself.

2750
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:44,080
What happened?

2751
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:44,560
Nothing.

2752
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,790
I was sitting at the restaurant.

2753
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:26,910
She didn't look at me.

2754
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,400
We wiped it face to face.

2755
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,800
She just walked over.

2756
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,150
I don't know how to communicate.

2757
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:56,000
and what choice she would make.

2758
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,760
Should I wait for you?

2759
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:04,720
Why are you...

2760
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,550
Why are you still bringing this up?

2761
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:08,240
Don't you want to eat?

2762
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,200
No, I do.

2763
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,200
Let everyone eat.

2764
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:10,640
Warm it up.

2765
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,120
We need to save food, you know?

2766
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:12,720
Let's go.

2767
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,390
Let's go.

2768
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,520
Why are you dressed up?

2769
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,160
You have food too. Oh no. I ate too early.

2770
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,600
It's all delicious.

2771
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:31,230
They haven't even touched

2772
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:31,760
Right?

2773
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,040
So many delicious food.

2774
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:37,880
What's wrong?

2775
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:39,920
Nothing.

2776
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,080
I'm not.

2777
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,400
You have something?

2778
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,440
I have something important to do.

2779
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:45,920
Let's sit over there.

2780
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,030
Changed seats.

2781
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:50,640
That's too much attention.

2782
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,630
Smile.

2783
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,320
Not my buddy.

2784
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,880
What are you laughing at?

2785
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,680
Have fun.

2786
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,400
Smile on the face but in the heart

2787
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,640
What?

2788
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,840
What's in your heart?

2789
01:56:08,830 --> 01:56:09,880
Nothing.

2790
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:13,920
What? Is it fun?

2791
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:16,800
I think we had a good chat.

2792
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,920
Xinxin is not happy.

2793
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:20,510
No.

2794
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:22,400
I...

2795
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,440
How should I put it?

2796
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,590
But I'm curious about your choice later.

2797
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:28,960
Okay, you got me.

2798
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,270
You're a little hesitant.

2799
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:31,920
Very conflicted and contradictory.

2800
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,760
Does he like you?

2801
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:34,590
I don't know.

2802
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,240
But I think we had a good chat.

2803
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,880
First, her Cupid invitation card.

2804
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:38,680
Give me my brother.

2805
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,640
I asked her, she said she wanted to choose me.

2806
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,630
and texted me the second day.

2807
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:42,750
The third day he sent me this morning

2808
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:43,520
That one.

2809
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:45,400
She gave me the invitation card for the sports day.

2810
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,910
I chose Xinxin.

2811
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,480
But I think she's good.

2812
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,080
I think maybe

2813
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:55,920
you hesitated.

2814
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:00,920
I brought a book of answers.

2815
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,470
You know?

2816
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:03,440
For now.

2817
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,350
Okay.

2818
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,790
Hurry up. It'll be too late.

2819
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,640
You drive.

2820
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,280
Just open it?

2821
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,590
Open it yourself.

2822
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:15,920
Wait.

2823
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,520
So I want you

2824
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,640
not to change your choice.

2825
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:21,880
If you don't want me to change, then...

2826
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,560
So,

2827
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,920
you've already thought about it before you flip it.

2828
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,720
Definitely.

2829
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,560
I was hesitant.

2830
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,560
Who knows?

2831
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:38,110
Go ahead.

2832
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,560
See? I said I have the answer.

2833
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:58,160
To whom?

2834
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:03,320
Who?

2835
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:04,720
Who else?

2836
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,070
Which one?

2837
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:18,960
Yes.

2838
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,670
What did you say?

2839
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:22,430
Seriously.

2840
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:24,240
This is quite fun.

2841
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:24,880
Not bad, right?

2842
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:28,560
When I was reading the Book of Answer,

2843
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,160
I firmly decided

2844
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,320
and do my best.

2845
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,080
Who do you think I want to send messages to?

2846
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,320
You can choose whoever you want.

2847
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,710
What do you think?

2848
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,990
I can't give you an answer.

2849
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:52,670
What?

2850
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:53,470
Nothing.

2851
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,000
I'm a little hesitant.

2852
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,670
I can't choose.

2853
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:23,070
In fact, I'm very torn.

2854
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:28,560
I didn't think about the result.

2855
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,520
I don't know.

2856
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,360
This choice

2857
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:36,640
I will be harder than before.

2858
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:39,440
It's hard.

2859
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,310
Harry went on a date.

2860
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:43,200
I don't know how his date was.

2861
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,440
I'm going to text him soon.

2862
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,680
It'll be hard.

2863
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,960
Next time we'll get the first place.

2864
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,400
I guess Fatty sent it to me.

2865
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,200
Because we got the last place today.

2866
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,080
and sent it to Xiaoling.

2867
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:49,840
I've sent it. We'll get the first place next time.

2868
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,280
First, I said next time.

2869
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:54,840
I just want to get along with you.

2870
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:04,760
I received a reply from Xiaoling.

2871
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,040
I'm quite happy.

2872
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,920
She sent me

2873
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,680
Although she got three points today,

2874
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,720
she was happy.

2875
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,110
So I mean

2876
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:15,760
today, it means I feel happy

2877
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,360
makes her happy.

2878
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:21,310
I texted Fatty today.

2879
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:24,280
I just want to express

2880
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:25,920
my emotions.

2881
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,200
I had fun.

2882
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,280
There was a smoke bomb in the text.

2883
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,150
Did she say she had a good date today?

2884
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,440
I still sent it to Harry.

2885
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,230
I asked him if he had a good date today.

2886
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,360
That's what I wanted to ask

2887
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,320
at that time.

2888
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,190
I think this sentence

2889
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,630
has my own style.

2890
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:19,120
He will know it's me.

2891
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:27,320
I think today's message

2892
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,880
was sent by Xin.

2893
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,360
I think Esther and Tata

2894
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:31,640
are the girls

2895
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:34,400
who can send messages to me.

2896
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:38,270
Esther's personality is to play with me.

2897
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:39,280
and play with me.

2898
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,600
A girl

2899
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,000
Tata belongs to

2900
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,880
who can chat with.

2901
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,470
Harry was in the car tonight.

2902
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:50,840
He was inquiring about me.

2903
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,960
who I'm sending to tonight,

2904
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:53,950
I actually felt that

2905
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:55,640
He might be hinting at me.

2906
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:58,360
I think the most romantic thing

2907
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:00,190
the most romantic thing is preference.

2908
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,760
So I'm looking forward to it.

2909
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,430
I think Harry sent it.

2910
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:21,360
Maybe he chatted with me in the car.

2911
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,390
in the car.

2912
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:25,440
He probably wanted to know more about me.

2913
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:29,360
I must be happy then.

2914
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:32,480
Because he still thought about me after the date.

2915
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,520
But I think

2916
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,520
a little perfunctory.

2917
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,600
So happy.

2918
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,600
No.

2919
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,040
No way.

2920
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:03,280
I'm pretty sure

2921
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,600
who sent it to me.

2922
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,600
Harry.

2923
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:28,400
You're such a bad guy.

2924
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,600
This is too obvious, right?

2925
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:30,800
The content of our chat tonight

2926
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,640
This is him.

2927
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:32,670
Aren't you bored?

2928
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,400
You don't belong

2929
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,550
a boring one.

2930
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:36,030
What's wrong?

2931
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:37,310
You're so dull.

2932
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,160
Right?

2933
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:41,920
He's bolder than yesterday.

2934
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,320
He dares to make fun of me.

2935
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,040
He said I was a dummy.

2936
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:47,960
But I think if it were yesterday,

2937
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,630
he wouldn't dare to say that.

2938
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:51,920
He just showed his feelings.

2939
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,040
about my feelings.

2940
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,270
I didn't mean to hint her.

2941
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:55,840
It's obvious that I sent it.

2942
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,840
Tata's face

2943
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,680
to my taste.

2944
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,320
I sent the message to Xinxin.

2945
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,200
The girls in the small house are excellent.

2946
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,350
Actually, I want to get in touch with them.

2947
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:32,990
I received Hua's message.

2948
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:34,640
It was obviously her.

2949
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,560
We had fun this afternoon.

2950
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,880
I texted Tae-seo

2951
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:43,120
I sent it to Tae-seo.

2952
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,880
I think Tae-seo is very careful.

2953
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,320
I didn't always skate on the snow.

2954
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,520
When Tae-ri saw it,

2955
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:50,520
he will help me.

2956
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,070
Here.

2957
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:51,710
Thank you.

2958
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:52,510
Don't slip.

2959
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:53,080
Okay.

2960
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,480
I think he's quite considerate.

2961
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:58,160
After spending the whole day with him,

2962
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,160
I think I get along quite well with him.

2963
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,070
I can get to know more about him.

2964
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,160
I'm very happy today.

2965
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:13,560
I think this one

2966
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,070
was sent by the map.

2967
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:22,040
Today's message was from Tata.

2968
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:24,030
Because I want to know more about

2969
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,520
other than

2970
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,800
we have

2971
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,440
in life.

2972
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,230
and praise me for being a cheerful boy.

2973
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,670
I guess it's Tata.

2974
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,040
I sent my message to Map tonight.

2975
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,600
When we rushed down from the slope,

2976
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,440
from the slope,

2977
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,040
the map was standing on the slope

2978
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,600
on that slope.

2979
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:53,600
Trust me, Tata.

2980
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:54,640
Come on.

2981
02:06:58,080 --> 02:06:59,230
Next.

2982
02:06:59,230 --> 02:07:01,400
During the sports day,

2983
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:04,190
he was always full of energy.

2984
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:06,400
He's always full of energy.

2985
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,030
Actually, I really need

2986
02:07:08,030 --> 02:07:09,720
a friend like him.

2987
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:12,960
or accompanying

2988
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,720
Actually, when I received your message,

2989
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,830
I didn't know whose text it was.

2990
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,520
But I have a guess.

2991
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,120
it should be soup.

2992
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:56,830
I don't really understand

2993
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:59,070
the meaning of this letter.

2994
02:07:59,070 --> 02:07:59,870
But I can feel

2995
02:07:59,870 --> 02:08:03,320
the enthusiasm of this letter

2996
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:05,310
is not very high.

2997
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,800
It's very plain.

2998
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,760
It doesn't look like it.

2999
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,640
The soup is usually sent to me.

3000
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,720
That kind of text.

3001
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:26,320
I'll send it to her today.

3002
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,160
I firmly chose

3003
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:28,830
Susu.

3004
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,640
Being with her

3005
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:33,470
I think I have a lot of time to be happy.

3006
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,240
I'm curious if she'll send me

3007
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,240
to Terri.

3008
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:09,150
Because it was his birthday that day.

3009
02:09:09,150 --> 02:09:10,520
he was refunded like this.

3010
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,550
I think

3011
02:09:11,550 --> 02:09:13,920
I should apologize

3012
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,240
and something I want to say.

3013
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,560
When we were eating,

3014
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:18,840
we had a good chat.

3015
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:20,280
I found that we are very similar.

3016
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:27,840
When I saw Susu's message,

3017
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:31,000
I thought I still had a chance.

3018
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,040
to receive the text.

3019
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,880
I was quite disappointed.

3020
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,200
Unhappy.

3021
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:12,920
If we like each other,

3022
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:16,440
this kind of situation doesn't exist.

3023
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,320
You should care about each other's feelings

3024
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,680
than your own feelings.

3025
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,720
I can totally feel

3026
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:35,480
he's developing towards Xiao Ling.

3027
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:54,840
I'm still a little disappointed.

3028
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:56,720
That's the awkward part.

3029
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:57,630
He said

3030
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:58,590
I hope he can accept other girls.

3031
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:01,310
But there's still hope in his heart.

3032
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:01,790
If he doesn't want it,

3033
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:03,070
he will firmly choose me.

3034
02:11:03,070 --> 02:11:03,800
No matter what,

3035
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,400
he's willing to follow me.

3036
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:19,870
Don't laugh.

3037
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,320
I think she must have received

3038
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,720
received Harry's message today.

3039
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,320
If she didn't receive Harry's message,

3040
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,760
she would've jumped up and snatched the house.

3041
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:56,600
Don't be angry.

3042
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:00,800
Actually, I really feel cold sweat for her.

3043
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:01,630
Because I think

3044
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:03,760
it wouldn't have been two days in a row.

3045
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,360
for two days.

3046
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,640
I think

3047
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:08,440
some minor problems.

3048
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,040
She may not

3049
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,590
not as active as others.

3050
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:11,520
She hid herself

3051
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,200
hide or protect herself well.

3052
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,030
Don't always help others.

3053
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:18,520
and try to get in touch with them.

3054
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,520
My brothers didn't receive any text today.

3055
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,320
When I found out about this,

3056
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,000
my first reaction

3057
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,440
I glanced at him subconsciously.

3058
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:50,080
I was afraid that he was looking at me.

3059
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:50,910
because I didn't want him to find out.

3060
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:52,160
I was observing him.

3061
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,600
Then I took it back immediately.

3062
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,880
But after a while, I couldn't help

3063
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,960
I kept looking at him.

3064
02:12:57,150 --> 02:12:58,880
His expression is

3065
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,990
I think he laughed helplessly.

3066
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:04,800
I can feel that

3067
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,480
tired and uncomfortable.

3068
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,000
So I think

3069
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,520
it must be related to the text.

3070
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:19,390
Terri received two messages tonight.

3071
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:21,470
I think one is Susu.

3072
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,960
and Huahua.

3073
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,600
Because he actually

3074
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,000
with Hua.

3075
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:36,240
The map and Harry are very obvious.

3076
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,630
It's them.

3077
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:40,080
I want to know

3078
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,270
who Map and Harry will favor more.

3079
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:47,070
Tata.

3080
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,080
Tata, I miss you.

3081
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:51,480
I miss you.

3082
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,120
Launch of love

3083
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:37,310
I think my brothers

3084
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:38,680
because he knows me better.

3085
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:39,800
through me.

3086
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,120
I can tell

3087
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:43,360
I could tell that I was struggling.

3088
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,470
Then he snatched the house of siblings.

3089
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,480
Both of them have a lot

3090
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:50,480
to talk to each other.

3091
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:57,470
I want to laugh.

3092
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,390
Because I saw your face.

3093
02:14:59,390 --> 02:15:00,120
You know what?

3094
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,720
I didn't ask many questions.

3095
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:05,440
I know.

3096
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,360
But you didn't choose the soup.

3097
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,560
I just didn't send it to him.

3098
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,480
You didn't send it to him?

3099
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,000
Yes.

3100
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:11,760
You sent it to...

3101
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:12,640
I knew it.

3102
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:15,600
He didn't send it to you.

3103
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:16,560
He didn't.

3104
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,000
Actually, I'm fine.

3105
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:20,830
I sent it to him because I think

3106
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,880
he seems to care.

3107
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,920
I rejected him today.

3108
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:24,760
When we were eating and chatting,

3109
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:25,760
he said it several times.

3110
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:26,200
Anyway...

3111
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:26,840
And...

3112
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:29,310
I want to send it to him

3113
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:32,880
I think I should send it to him.

3114
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:35,390
Actually, I thought about

3115
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:36,720
after I sent this message,

3116
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,400
should I explain to Soup?

3117
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,400
Are you going to explain?

3118
02:15:40,990 --> 02:15:43,070
Is this the reason for your birthday?

3119
02:15:43,070 --> 02:15:44,160
But it's really like this.

3120
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,920
To be honest,

3121
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,120
An explanation is just a cover-up.

3122
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:53,310
Who did you send it to?

3123
02:15:55,710 --> 02:15:56,720
Who?

3124
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:57,400
The one next to you.

3125
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:58,480
Tata.

3126
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:01,360
I had a great chat today.

3127
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,040
Okay.

3128
02:16:03,550 --> 02:16:04,600
So who sent it to you today?

3129
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,040
I don't think it's her.

3130
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,230
You think it's Xinxin?

3131
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:09,200
Do you know why I don't think it's a tower?

3132
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:12,080
Because Tata sent me

3133
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:12,880
English name.

3134
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:14,270
Today I sent

3135
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:14,840
Chinese.

3136
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:15,390
Harry.

3137
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:17,560
If I knew

3138
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:19,440
I could talk to her so happily today,

3139
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,600
I would pick her during the day.

3140
02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:21,720
I had a good chat too.

3141
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:22,880
But we are

3142
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,440
we are very similar.

3143
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:26,480
We are really

3144
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:28,880
not very similar.

3145
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,160
but they complement each other.

3146
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,070
I'm just like

3147
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:32,799
is exactly the same as Tae-seo.

3148
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:34,680
I think he's my brother, you know?

3149
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:36,240
I think he's my brother.

3150
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:37,080
We have the same frequency.

3151
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,040
We look alike.

3152
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:40,120
That kind of brother.

3153
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:42,959
So you're more biased

3154
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:43,520
more tarot.

3155
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,080
Esther is more.

3156
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:47,709
It's quite complicated.

3157
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,799
I think I'll choose a tower anyway.

3158
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,240
How do you feel?

3159
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,520
I don't know who sent it to me.

3160
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,799
I know.

3161
02:16:57,469 --> 02:16:59,160
It must be soup.

3162
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:00,400
If you say that,

3163
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:01,080
Why?

3164
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:02,590
Because he told me that

3165
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:04,000
ordinary content.

3166
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,230
I can guess what you wrote.

3167
02:17:07,230 --> 02:17:08,400
You probably can't guess it.

3168
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:09,920
It's very plain.

3169
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:12,030
It must be soup.

3170
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:17,559
We are really

3171
02:17:17,559 --> 02:17:18,520
Or...

3172
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:25,879
After the whole day,

3173
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,200
and soup during the day,

3174
02:17:32,350 --> 02:17:33,719
he took care of me.

3175
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:36,799
He fell 80 times.

3176
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:37,790
and helped me 80 times.

3177
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:46,639
What am I doing?

3178
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:50,160
Don't fall down. Slow down.

3179
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:52,990
I saw it.

3180
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:58,270
What should I do?

3181
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:02,400
I'm frustrated.

3182
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,400
I'm really frustrated.

3183
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,160
When I knew

3184
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,030
this letter was sent by soup,

3185
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:10,430
after the soup was sent.

3186
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:11,709
Ask?

3187
02:18:11,709 --> 02:18:13,040
Or you go by yourself?

3188
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,440
I'll think about it.

3189
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:16,830
Think about it.

3190
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:17,520
Yes.

3191
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,000
Is it fun?

3192
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,469
Is it getting interesting?

3193
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,680
I don't understand.

3194
02:19:03,639 --> 02:19:05,600
I'm just sad.

3195
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,000
It's helpless, isn't it?

3196
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:22,840
Are you busy?

3197
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,240
Are you free?

3198
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:25,520
Just wait.

3199
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:26,750
Okay.

3200
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:41,719
I can feel it.

3201
02:19:41,719 --> 02:19:44,190
he doesn't want to talk about

3202
02:19:44,190 --> 02:19:45,240
to talk about this.

3203
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,240
I think

3204
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:37,280
she doesn't really like me.

3205
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:41,520
I never

3206
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:45,680
contact many people.

3207
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:03,600
I've given you everything I have.

3208
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,120
I gave everything I had.

3209
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,440
But she might not choose me.

3210
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,480
It's a pity.

3211
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,720
I don't know

3212
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,400
I think what happened these days

3213
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:34,280
is quite fake.

3214
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:45,280
I'm frustrated.

3215
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,800
I feel like I did something wrong.

3216
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,560
How is it?

3217
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:29,480
I'm fine.

3218
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:30,120
Okay.

3219
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:33,400
Where are we going?

3220
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:34,520
This way.

3221
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,200
You sent it to me today, right?

3222
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:09,280
I chose to send it to Tae-seo today

3223
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:11,080
because

3224
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,080
when we were eating,

3225
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,960
we said we were like

3226
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,880
He's my brother.

3227
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,040
He's my brother.

3228
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,840
I'm his sister.

3229
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,280
And

3230
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:21,960
I think on his birthday,

3231
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:24,520
on his birthday.

3232
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:26,560
If today is my birthday,

3233
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:27,720
on my birthday,

3234
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,800
I might

3235
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,560
send this to someone

3236
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:31,960
sent this.

3237
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:33,840
But he turned me down.

3238
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:35,080
And

3239
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:37,480
As you can see,

3240
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:38,560
I feel uncomfortable

3241
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:40,160
I feel uncomfortable all day.

3242
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:42,160
And I feel awkward.

3243
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I would feel very sad.

3244
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,800
Actually, before I went on a date,

3245
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,040
I would send this message to him.

3246
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,600
But the message I sent is...

3247
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:55,160
I'm sorry I rejected you this afternoon.

3248
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:57,360
And happy birthday to you again.

3249
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:03,280
But

3250
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,680
I'm afraid you'll overthink.

3251
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,000
I'm struggling.

3252
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,400
I've been struggling for a long time.

3253
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:21,800
I don't want

3254
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:25,000
who will be in a bad mood because of me.

3255
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,800
But I may

3256
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:30,600
ignored my real thoughts.

3257
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:32,840
I think

3258
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:35,280
this text doesn't mean

3259
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:38,680
send it to whoever you love more.

3260
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:39,880
I think

3261
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:42,000
I should send it to him.

3262
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,040
Don't you have anything to say?

3263
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:54,000
No.

3264
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:54,680
Let's talk tomorrow.

3265
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,920
Can you understand me?

3266
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:57,960
Not now.

3267
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:01,960
Not now.

3268
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,560
Why?

3269
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:10,000
Isn't this text

3270
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,720
send this message to someone you like?

3271
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:23,600
From my point of view, you can't.

3272
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:26,160
She may not be serious.

3273
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,440
to this matter.

3274
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:29,480
she probably

3275
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:32,200
that I care about her so much,

3276
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:35,240
or put my feelings

3277
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,760
her consideration.

3278
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,320
I didn't consider

3279
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,480
my real thoughts.

3280
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:52,200
So I'm afraid you'll misunderstand.

3281
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,920
I feel like I did something wrong.

3282
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:58,480
Well,

3283
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,200
feel guilty.

3284
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,920
You...

3285
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:08,400
more interested

3286
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:10,200
in him.

3287
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,200
Where do you think so?

3288
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,360
When there are many people,

3289
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:19,880
your attention might be on him.

3290
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,200
When?

3291
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:29,000
Let's talk tomorrow.

3292
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,520
You don't want to talk to me?

3293
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:33,960
I want to sleep.

3294
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:37,720
Okay.

3295
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,280
Let's talk tomorrow.

3296
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,560
Will we talk tomorrow?

3297
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:43,840
Really?

3298
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,040
Will you be unhappy?

3299
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,240
You sleep at night,

3300
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,880
You won't have insomnia

3301
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:50,760
Are you unhappy?

3302
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:52,800
I don't think so.

3303
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,320
I'm going back to wash up.

3304
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:55,800
Okay.

3305
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:56,520
Sleep early.

3306
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:00,800
I hope you can think about

3307
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:02,880
what I told you today.

3308
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:03,480
Okay?

3309
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:06,880
Good night. Go to sleep.

3310
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,200
You've already chosen.

3311
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:19,840
Right?

3312
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:22,520
You've already chosen.

3313
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:24,640
I don't know if I'm right.

3314
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,040
After you came back today,

3315
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:27,360
when you came back today?

3316
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:27,880
Yes.

3317
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:28,960
After today's chat,

3318
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,480
I feel I'm like her.

3319
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:31,760
I don't know if this is

3320
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,080
I was just imagining things.

3321
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,960
I'm just saying whatever I want.

3322
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,200
We talked a lot

3323
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,320
and talked a lot.

3324
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:44,520
Then I said you don't have to say.

3325
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:45,800
I know the answer.

3326
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:49,680
Good.

3327
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:50,720
I think it's good.

3328
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:29,360
What's wrong?

3329
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:37,640
I have a task for you.

3330
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:38,320
What?

3331
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:39,520
Get it some water.

3332
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,040
Sure.

3333
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:43,840
Take this upstairs and put it in your room.

3334
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:45,040
What's this?

3335
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,040
humidifier.

3336
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:46,600
Okay.

3337
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:52,720
Take a cup.

3338
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:57,080
It doesn't drink.

3339
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,240
It needs flowing water.

3340
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,960
I almost thought

3341
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:01,040
you bought it a drink machine.

3342
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:03,560
I bought it a water machine.

3343
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:05,440
It's like an automatic drinking machine.

3344
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:10,000
No way.

3345
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,160
I said I shouldn't.

3346
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,040
It was so fun today.

3347
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,160
What?

3348
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,320
Interesting.

3349
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:19,280
What's wrong?

3350
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:26,200
It's gone.

3351
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:30,920
It's gone.

3352
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:35,160
Sit there and talk.

3353
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,120
Okay.

3354
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,360
You sent it to me three times.

3355
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:39,960
Okay, stop it.

3356
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:41,800
I'm leaving. It's so awkward.

3357
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:42,760
Whether it's a letter

3358
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:43,760
or text.

3359
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:45,280
I'm glad you know. I'm leaving.

3360
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:48,080
I'm sorry.

3361
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:51,200
Why did you say it out loud?

3362
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:52,880
It's awkward.

3363
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,080
There's no one else.

3364
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:57,800
I'm here.

3365
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:00,200
Tell me.

3366
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:04,680
And today you said why I gave it to you.

3367
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:05,560
Well...

3368
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:05,800
No.

3369
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:07,360
That was unconsciously speaking out.

3370
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:09,160
It was subconsciously.

3371
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,400
I was too subconsciously.

3372
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:11,280
If you think

3373
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:12,200
If you don't like it,

3374
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:12,960
I'm just embarrassed.

3375
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:15,760
Because you can feel

3376
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:17,240
what my mouth looks like.

3377
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,520
From the first day to today,

3378
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,280
they think I’m E.

3379
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:24,760
But I think when we talk,

3380
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:25,960
when we talk.

3381
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:29,440
Let's go.

3382
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:31,960
It's so dramatic.

3383
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:32,680
Bye.

3384
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,720
I think

3385
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:58,240
this text doesn't mean

3386
02:31:58,240 --> 02:32:01,160
send it to whoever you love more.

3387
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,400
I think

3388
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,640
I should send it to him.

3389
