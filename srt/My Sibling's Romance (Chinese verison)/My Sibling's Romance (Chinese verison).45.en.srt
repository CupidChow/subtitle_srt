1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,360
represents my unknown love.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,480
Unknown love.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,360
My unknown love.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,280
This is a big declaration.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,040
But I think Fatty should say this.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,960
Just be generous.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,840
If there is, then there is no.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,280
Yeah, good.

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,079
This might be your last chance.

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,440
Unknown love.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,480
I was quite surprised.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,560
In front of so many people,

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,880
in front of so many people.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Since we're out,

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,280
And this is a rare opportunity.

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,360
Because I'm not sure

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,200
if I will

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,440
with Hua?

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,240
That's why I said this.

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,440
I think Fatty is joking.

21
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:38,920
Let us

22
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,760
in a joke.

23
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,120
But

24
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,400
I've made up my mind.

25
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,520
to be friends.

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,880
I didn't think too much.

27
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
Okay, take a good look.

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
You'll see it later.

29
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,240
Put it at home and bring it home.

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,560
Give it back to him.

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
It's my turn.

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,240
This one.

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,520
These three.

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,319
Handsome.

35
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,880
0.5 times. Indeed.

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
I didn't pull my legs. It's very high.

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,640
His head is small too.

38
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,039
1.9 meters.

39
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
There's no technique.

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,039
Hard and handsome. Nothing else.

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,680
When we go out,

42
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,800
I'll take a sample for him.

43
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,600
I told him

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,680
I want this angle.

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
I'll take it for you first.

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,800
Then I got it right.

47
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,960
he can aim at this.

48
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,160
the same flip.

49
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,080
Otherwise, he won't be able to film it.

50
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,360
It's just teaching.

51
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,039
Fatty is indeed slimmer.

52
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,640
Indeed.

53
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,960
This jawline is not as sharp as blade,

54
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,240
but

55
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
you can keep going.

56
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:41,920
You can do it.

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,320
Okay.

58
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,640
Join us sooner or later.

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,360
Join us.

60
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Fatty is the hardest part.

61
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
So I think everyone should choose me.

62
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,840
OK.

63
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
It's quite difficult.

64
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,440
What's so hard about Tae-ri?

65
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,200
Yes.

66
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,440
Stand there.

67
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,280
Anyway, you have to choose us.

68
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,280
How about this?

69
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's take each photo

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
and go out.

71
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
Let's look at each other.

72
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,120
The map is afraid you'll forget him.

73
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,440
There's a text message.

74
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
The best photographer in your mind.

75
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,760
Now please guess

76
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,640
who will be the best photographer in this round.

77
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,600
The wrong person will be punished

78
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
by the netizens on Weibo.

79
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,280
On the day of the show,

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,840
on Weibo.

81
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
Three, two, one.

82
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Map.

83
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
Soup.

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,720
Only Bom is different from us.

85
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,800
OK. Let’s see who it is.

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,560
The drawing got five votes.

87
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,600
Map.

88
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,560
Five votes.

89
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,040
Awesome.

90
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for your love.

91
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,040
Thank you, the most beautiful model.

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm not.

93
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,360
You are...

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,320
Have you forgotten your sister?

95
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
I ignored you.

96
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,480
We're almost done.

97
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,800
Let's go.

98
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
Let's go.

99
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,079
Let's go.

100
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,760
OK.

101
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,720
Congratulations to the seven of us

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,480
the seven of us have succeeded.

103
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Mr. Lynne

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,320
needs to post on Weibo

105
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
on the day of the show.

106
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
comments or the siblings you support

107
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
or partners.

108
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
send their wishes

109
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,920
in the way you like.

110
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
In fact, during the trip,

111
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
taking photos

112
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,520
is something everyone has experienced.

113
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
Have you

114
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,240
with the other half,

115
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,160
do you have any memorable photos

116
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,360
Can you share with us?

117
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,560
Because I'm a real equipment party.

118
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Before doing anything,

119
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,200
I must prepare the equipment first.

120
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
For example, before playing music,

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,440
I need to prepare all the instruments.

122
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,079
Then I'm going out.

123
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,480
For example, take a scenery photo.

124
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,920
For example, going on a trip with the other half.

125
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,320
I must rent the camera

126
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Now I use my phone

127
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,360
Yes, just take a photo with your phone.

128
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,080
The most memorable

129
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,960
is this photo of going to Iceland to see aurora.

130
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,480
This is killing.

131
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,640
She took it for me.

132
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,560
If I brush it again,

133
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll have her photos.

134
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,279
Brush.

135
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
It's troublesome to shoot the night view.

136
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,400
First, we need to stay away from the city's light source.

137
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
We drove

138
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,400
from that town.

139
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,720
Then what is the speed of the fast gate?

140
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,680
Then what?

141
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,920
If we check there, we'll freeze to death.

142
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,200
How fast is the fast door?

143
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,120
Because the aurora takes time.

144
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
So we have to wait for it to come out

145
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Hurry up.

146
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Then press it.

147
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
and run to take photos.

148
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
So besides taking photos,

149
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,840
did you

150
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,720
For example, record a song

151
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,400
Do you have a video?

152
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,080
on a road without people.

154
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,960
and sing your favorite song together.

155
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,560
Yes.

156
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,159
So romantic.

157
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm looking forward to your musical.

158
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes, what's the name of a musical?

159
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
"Looking for Li Er Gou".

160
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Come on.

161
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Wish Jiang Dunhao’s musical a hit.

162
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Thank you.

163
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
It's like My Middle Girl's Generation.

164
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,440
Please support it.

165
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,960
Of course.

166
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,440
My photo is...

167
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,360
Where is this Great Wall?

168
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,000
The Great Wall.

169
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,280
This is the first time we went on a trip.

170
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
to climb the Great Wall.

171
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,240
Then I found that his Chinese was poor.

172
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,960
I was hiking there.

173
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
He was afraid that I would fall down.

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,480
He wanted to tell me to be careful,

175
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
but his Chinese is not good.

176
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
He always said

177
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,720
Worried.

178
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
So cute.

179
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,080
This one.

180
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,200
So sweet.

181
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,320
Blade Point’s jawline.

182
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,840
This is

183
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,200
before we had kids.

184
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,840
before having kids.

185
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,080
Yes.

186
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,760
We were in a relationship at that time.

187
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
for more than ten years.

188
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes.

189
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
It still feels sweet.

190
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
Because it's just the two of us.

191
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah, it's different if you have a child.

192
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,720
Yes.

193
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,200
So on that trip,

194
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
And this was on a bus.

195
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
on a public bus.

196
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
Because we had kids,

197
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,440
we haven't travelled together.

198
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Yes.

199
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,320
So I miss it when I see this.

200
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
Yes.

201
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,840
It's really different

202
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
It's different when I see it.

203
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,600
Then I miss

204
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,840
When it was just the two of us,

205
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,960
we should go more places.

206
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
It's okay.

207
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,480
We'll wait until

208
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,320
our kids will abandon us when they are older.

209
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
But I have buts.

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
You have "but".

211
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
But last year

212
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,040
my husband and I went to Danish alone

213
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
And this is

214
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
walking on Danish street,

215
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
my friend was behind us

216
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
on the street.

217
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
The two of us

218
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,720
can still see the world.

219
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,240
Only the two of us

220
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
It feels like

221
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,440
in love.

222
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,560
So I suggest

223
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,800
we should work hard

224
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,000
we should try to create some opportunities

225
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
to go on a date alone.

226
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
to get back the feeling of love.

227
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,360
I have a photo

228
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
for me and my parents.

229
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,920
It's warm.

230
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
The atmosphere is good

231
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
Yes, it's warm.

232
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
This is

233
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
In Dubai.

234
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,080
I knew it.

235
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Yes.

236
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,840
It's in a dark desert.

237
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,040
So you're wearing

238
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,520
like the Middle East.

239
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,080
Yes.

240
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,760
Right?

241
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
It's a Bossimian style.

242
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,280
or Middle East.

243
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,680
There was a photo he took for me.

244
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,080
That day,

245
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,160
It was the first day

246
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,640
the first day we raised a dog.

247
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,520
and brought it back.

248
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Then I put it on my back.

249
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,480
I think it's cute.

250
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,000
and loving.

251
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,560
So the photo

252
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
the memory.

253
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
Can you remember the story?

254
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes.

255
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
I took the bus.

256
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
Go upstairs.

257
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
I feel it.

258
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,560
Here.

259
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,680
Sit here

260
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,760
Both of you sit down.

261
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,080
Sit with my sister.

262
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Fatty is sitting with Hua.

263
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Amazing love. Hello.

264
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,760
What?

265
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Unknown Love. Hello.

266
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
Come on.

267
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,520
Get off.

268
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,560
What did you do before?

269
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,040
I asked you to make up

270
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,280
Now you have to make up for it.

271
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
Men grow up in love.

272
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm so mad.

273
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,560
I dare not ride on the Ferris wheel.

274
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
I dare not, bro.

275
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Let's take the Ferris wheel.

276
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
When I reach the top,

277
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,080
I'll lie down

278
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
You're at the top

279
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,120
When I reach one sixth,

280
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
I trembled. I was the highest.

281
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
Me too.

282
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
They had a good time back then.

283
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Your hands are cold.

284
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
You look warm.

285
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,760
They're so sweet.

286
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
It's useless.

287
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Because there's a card behind me.

288
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
This kind of detail is very important.

289
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
My left hand is not cold.

290
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm not cold. I'm fine.

291
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
Only my face is cold.

292
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,640
I forgot you gave me the scarf.

293
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,600
Look.

294
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
Don't look at me.

295
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,680
Why don't you just show your eyes?

296
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,760
Now the soup looks at Susu with love.

297
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
Rath.

298
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Actually, I can...

299
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
Forget it. It's okay.

300
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,360
What can you do?

301
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,960
Nothing.

302
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,520
Go ahead.

303
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,080
Nothing.

304
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,200
What's wrong?

305
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,320
So what?

306
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,120
A long distance.

307
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
He's going abroad.

308
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
A long distance.

309
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,560
We've been holding each other.

310
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
Xiao Ling, why aren't you afraid of the cold?

311
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,120
I don't know.

312
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,240
because Xinjiang is very high.

313
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
This cold is nothing.

314
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,920
You know?

315
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
People from Xinjiang.

316
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
It's my first time meeting soup.

317
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,600
Soup told me he was a mixed American.

318
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,480
When I went back to the house,

319
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,800
you said he was from Xinjiang.

320
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,680
I started to suspect that he was lying to me.

321
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
I thought he was from Xinjiang.

322
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,680
You two are really like Xinjiang people.

323
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,680
I can lie to you with a language.

324
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,880
I love you.

325
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,360
Why did you say I love you?

326
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
You know?

327
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
How do you know?

328
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,240
Because she loves me.

329
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
I mean you.

330
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
He said...

331
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,720
He asked why you love me?

332
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,600
You scared me.

333
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,760
She said well, so she came out naturally.

334
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,720
Don't be so sensitive.

335
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,000
Here's the thing.

336
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,400
Why are you leaning on me?

337
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
You really don't care about anyone's life.

338
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,360
Your filter is so scary.

339
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
It doesn't look like me at all.

340
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,560
You have to press that.

341
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Why is my face so big?

342
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,880
He tried his best

343
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,400
to get it back.

344
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280
I tried my best to take the initiative. Look.

345
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,560
Yes.

346
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,960
Fatty.

347
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,480
I want to get it back.

348
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,320
You stepped on my foot.

349
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Sorry.

350
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
I want to take a Ferris wheel.

351
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,960
and stepped on my foot.

352
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
Tae-seo.

353
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,560
Here.

354
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Terri doesn't need it.

355
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll take a Ferris wheel.

356
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,560
Tae-seo.

357
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
Tae-seo, take a photo for us.

358
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm expensive. I'll take a photo.

359
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll give you 50 cents.

360
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,360
That's too much.

361
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,880
Tata takes the initiative to Harry.

362
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,840
He has a sense of atmosphere.

363
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,600
I can't take it anymore.

364
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
What?

365
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,080
It's too sweet.

366
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,880
Really.

367
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,840
It's good to take any random photos.

368
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,160
Tae-seo did a great job.

369
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
It's really pretty.

370
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
Which one? I want to see it.

371
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,320
Awesome, Tae-seo.

372
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,200
They want to take pictures of the picture too.

373
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,600
And these two.

374
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,160
Yes.

375
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Me too.

376
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,880
Give me some soup.

377
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,560
It's okay. I feel it.

378
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm leaning on you.

379
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,760
Good. I feel it.

380
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
They seem to get along well.

381
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
How's the soup?

382
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,480
Do you want some?

383
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,680
Take one.

384
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
Use my phone.

385
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,480
Come closer.

386
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Ask them to kiss.

387
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
Sweet, okay?

388
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
Soup.

389
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,960
Cool.

390
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Good. Again. Good.

391
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,080
That was good.

392
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
I like this one.

393
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,720
Fireworks!

394
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,280
I saw it.

395
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm so happy.

396
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,200
I think Fatty is very active today.

397
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Super proactive.

398
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,320
Unknown love

399
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm confused.

400
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm gossiping.

401
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,600
They are also eating.

402
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,640
I decided to chase them.

403
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,840
You decided to chase him in a few days.

404
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
He started chasing.

405
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
He figured it out.

406
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,640
It's just a few days away.

407
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,360
I think we need to move.

408
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,560
If you don't send it tonight,

409
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm very prideful.

410
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,640
When they asked me out,

411
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,920
I said I'm not going.

412
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,480
Indeed.

413
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
People like me

414
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,360
I'll pay for my impulsiveness.

415
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
I always say

416
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,800
Fatty is good at guiding me.

417
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Fatty is good at guiding me.

418
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Then he scratches his head.

419
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,840
What should I do?

420
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,400
We shouldn't have done that.

421
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes.

422
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,080
To members of the house,

423
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,400
Tomorrow is the group trip.

424
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,080
The two routes are

425
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,320
"Joking" and "teasing you".

426
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,200
Please choose a representative in each room.

427
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
to get the mission card.

428
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Draw the blind box to decide the route.

429
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,680
Okay, I'll go.

430
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm going.

431
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,920
I'm going.

432
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,600
Okay.

433
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,520
Don't fight with me.

434
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,960
It's meaningless.

435
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,120
Four babies.

436
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
What do you think?

437
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,040
Take whatever you want.

438
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,760
All blind boxes.

439
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,520
Who is it?

440
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,440
I don't know who will take it first. It's a clear card.

441
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,720
I want to draw

442
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,200
draw a group.

443
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,440
I want to play with him.

444
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,480
Bao Xianling.

445
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,120
What are you?

446
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,760
Are you a "medium"?

447
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm "kidding".

448
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm "suke".

449
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's do it together.

450
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
No, I'm really crazy.

451
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
See you.

452
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,080
Bye.

453
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,800
Good night.

454
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,160
What are you doing

455
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,800
What are you doing?

456
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,200
I want some specialties from Tianjin.

457
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
Let's go.

458
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
A trip is great.

459
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
Yes.

460
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,800
Sit with me.

461
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,560
Our team should be running today.

462
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
We're not...

463
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Excuse me.

464
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,520
Can someone help me?

465
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,480
I'll help you. You go up.

466
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,360
They've been together for a long time.

467
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes, this is destiny.

468
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,360
Why is the map here?

469
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,160
Hello, everyone.

470
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,800
Did you think it was me?

471
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,080
Did he switch with Hua?

472
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,800
Wonderful.

473
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm...

474
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm number one in the photography competition.

475
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,440
Now I have a right

476
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,480
to switch with

477
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,280
with another group.

478
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,320
Change the flowers.

479
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
You're crazy.

480
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I'll contact Tae-seo if I go there.

481
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,280
Tae-seo isn't here.

482
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,120
Tae-ri is in his team.

483
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,720
Yes.

484
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Bring it on. He can't beat me.

485
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,440
Fatty took the initiative.

486
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,360
Actually, I think

487
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,320
it's the best choice to switch with you.

488
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,720
Sure.

489
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,200
Let's change.

490
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
Would you mind if I sit here?

491
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
Of course not.

492
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,680
Will you be angry and scold me in your heart?

493
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,360
It's your bag.

494
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,240
As long as Xiao Ling is there, you must come.

495
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,880
Actually,

496
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,240
we knew it must be you.

497
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
You worked so hard yesterday.

498
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280
Really?

499
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,800
No.

500
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,280
If I knew it was a reward like this,

501
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
I don't want to win.

502
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,720
What do you mean?

503
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,640
What is he talking about?

504
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,240
I was happy

505
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,119
I still feel happy.

506
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
With us?

507
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,880
Yes.

508
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,000
Surprise?

509
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,880
Surprised?

510
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,079
This group is pretty.

511
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
I like it.

512
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Mr. Hua, sit in the middle.

513
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,720
You will arrange it.

514
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,640
Hurry up.

515
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,560
I'll sit in the middle.

516
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,560
Hurry up.

517
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,440
If you

518
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,880
let him go now,

519
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,600
If he asks you to go,

520
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,480
will you go there?

521
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,280
No.

522
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,160
Of course not.

523
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,360
But she's gone.

524
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,560
No, he's a nice guy.

525
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,240
She's like this sometimes.

526
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520
She doesn't want her to lose face.

527
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
But if you go like this,

528
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,440
you'll make Tae-seo lose face.

529
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,160
If they don't

530
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,240
in the third corner,

531
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,560
he can do this.

532
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,920
But Terri is right next to him.

533
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,880
Jiang Dunhao, join us.

534
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,360
It’s already a fight.

535
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,840
Stop fighting.

536
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,800
If it were me,

537
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,240
I would say wait.

538
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
I won't embarrass them.

539
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,440
But I will also

540
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,920
to be less humble.

541
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,760
You're like a deer who never goes there.

542
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,960
She said shut up.

543
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,520
She sent a message.

544
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
Did you see it?

545
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
Yes.

546
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,680
I need to learn the local Tianjin dialect.

547
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
I came to Tientsin.

548
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
I didn't learn it.

549
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
It's done.

550
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,000
Isn't it just one sentence?

551
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,400
It's a similarity.

552
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,920
It is.

553
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,400
Isn't this it?

554
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
It's a mixture.

555
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
You said it's numb.

556
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
They might take you to the bus.

557
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
and send you away.

558
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
What do you think we will do?

559
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,680
I can't tell

560
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,240
what "kidding" means.

561
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,880
Where are you going?

562
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,320
I think they'll tease me.

563
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm in Beijing now.

564
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
Could it be

565
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,040
solve the problem?

566
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,720
Is it that hard?

567
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,880
It should be too hard.

568
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,400
I think

569
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,200
related to the culture in Tientsin.

570
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Are you sleepy?

571
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm about to fall asleep.

572
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,600
Okay.

573
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,160
I'll apply for it.

574
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
Let's go separately.

575
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,840
It's okay.

576
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,040
Because they are

577
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,600
They know a long-distance relationship is coming.

578
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
Yes.

579
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,000
Emotions.

580
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
I don't want to be with you anymore.

581
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,920
They have entered the next stage.

582
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,240
Dear members of the House,

583
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
From now on,

584
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,560
you can ask the members

585
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,080
about your age.

586
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,240
You can't ask directly, right?

587
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,320
Information, age.

588
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
Anything else related?

589
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,480
What's your zodiac?

590
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,560
What was my zodiac?

591
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,040
When were you an adult?

592
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,360
I think I was born in the Year of the Horse.

593
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,720
Horse?

594
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,480
Really?

595
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
Do you believe it?

596
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,200
Of course not.

597
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,280
He doesn't look like one.

598
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,520
But he looks younger than you.

599
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,160
He gets off when he's younger than me.

600
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Why?

601
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Let me tell you why.

602
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,880
Because she doesn't like younger ones.

603
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,920
Really?

604
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,400
Not even a month or a day.

605
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,000
You know me so well.

606
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
That's all, bro.

607
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm sorry.

608
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,480
I didn't expect

609
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,440
I didn't expect that.

610
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,160
I have to say

611
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,240
his humor is quite useful.

612
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Right?

613
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,520
I didn't expect that.

614
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
So I was one day younger than you.

615
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,240
even one day younger than you.

616
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Yes.

617
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,080
I've told Bobo.

618
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,360
Have you talked about

619
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,200
Have you heard about it?

620
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,960
No. Don't talk about age.

621
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
We can talk now.

622
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,960
There are so many people now.

623
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Wait, let me ask you secretly.

624
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,600
Later I found that I was one round older than you.

625
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
That's great.

626
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,760
Let's hold hands.

627
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
I have to

628
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
and her age.

629
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
Otherwise,

630
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
I think this is more interesting

631
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,960
more interesting.

632
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,320
Yes.

633
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,040
It’s hard for me to win this track.

634
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,840
Not you.

635
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,640
Can you accept a girl older than you

636
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,440
is dating?

637
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,160
To be honest,

638
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
I had a relationship before.

639
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,560
No.

640
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Let's not talk about the past.

641
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
You should be five years old.

642
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,440
You can be five years old.

643
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
You can accept that

644
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,440
five years older than me.

645
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,400
I can be five years older than me,

646
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
but I can't accept that you're five years younger than me.

647
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,760
I can.

648
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
Guess

649
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,440
What you said

650
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
I have a very accurate prediction.

651
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,800
From 1990 to 1995,

652
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,400
From 1990 to 1995.

653
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
Get off.

654
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,280
It's a big leap.

655
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
Susu, do you prefer older

656
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,800
or younger?

657
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,200
Before and back.

658
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,640
We can't be too different.

659
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,360
You like the soup?

660
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
A little older than you.

661
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,760
or younger than you?

662
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,640
It depends on who I like.

663
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,760
So fake.

664
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,160
Too sweet.

665
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
Are you going to say it or not?

666
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,680
"Dragon Girl".

667
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
"Dragon Girl".

668
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,360
What?

669
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I'm not a dragon.

670
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,200
Okay.

671
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Okay.

672
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,840
My sister was born in 2000.

673
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,560
How old are you?

674
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,840
Don't sleep. How old are you?

675
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
It's okay. Go to sleep.

676
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,120
Which year are you in?

677
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm 20 years old.

678
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
But I really want to know

679
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,840
who's older?

680
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,800
I think she's older than me.

681
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
It should be me.

682
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,440
I was born in 2004.

683
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,720
What about you?

684
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,240
You know, right?

685
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,320
You should be able to guess.

686
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,920
She was born in 2002.

687
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
How did you know?

688
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,160
Actually, I've always guessed

689
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,600
Tu Tu is younger than me.

690
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,160
But when I heard him say

691
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840
in 2004,

692
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
I felt a little upset.

693
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,160
I would say no.

694
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
It feels like this.

695
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
Xiao Ling was born in 2002.

696
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
I was born in 2004.

697
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,920
Because I heard Xiaoling say

698
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,040
I said I didn't communicate with young people.

699
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,600
So I thought

700
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,120
a little gap.

701
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,680
That soup was made in 2004.

702
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,600
The soup is smaller than mine.

703
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
The soup should be from 2003.

704
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
The soup was made in 2003.

705
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Yes, you were born in 2002?

706
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,520
What about you?

707
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,280
I was born in 1996.

708
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,680
Really?

709
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,040
I can't tell.

710
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,720
Sister

711
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,120
28 years old.

712
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,560
Yes.

713
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,280
Where is Fatty?

714
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,320
Thirty.

715
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,040
He said it directly.

716
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes.

717
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,160
It's not inquiry information anymore.

718
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,360
Where's Tata?

719
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,960
2001.

720
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,760
In 2001, it's just as I expected.

721
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm curious how old Terri is.

722
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,520
He was born in 1997.

723
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
27 years old.

724
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,480
You're right.

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,080
right?

726
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,200
How big did you guess?

727
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,240
I guess 28 years old.

728
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,600
I guess 278 too.

729
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Yes, almost.

730
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
Who else in that car?

731
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,760
Where is Hua?

732
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,520
Guess Hua.

733
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
1998, right?

734
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,200
1997.

735
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
She was born in 1997 too.

736
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,400
She was in 1997.

737
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,880
Is this a blind date corner?

738
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,040
What is this place?

739
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,000
Park.

740
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
There really is

741
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
What kind of sticker is that?

742
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,960
Gosh.

743
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,720
This is fun.

744
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
This is very fun.

745
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
Let's go and have a look.

746
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
I'll take you to the corner of the park.

747
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,960
Put my photo on it.

748
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,800
Okay.

749
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,920
Where is the blind date corner?

750
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
Are you really going?

751
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,880
to see if there are any good guys.

752
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
What a blind date.

753
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,160
182 meters, 1981.

754
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,040
Hurry up, Yinbo.

755
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,240
I’m 1.82 meters.

756
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,000
Here, young man.

757
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,280
Register here. Here, 100 yuan.

758
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,040
Register.

759
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Let's go.

760
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,200
Why are they all so handsome?

761
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,560
Thank you.

762
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,320
Why are you so handsome

763
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,720
So handsome.

764
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,520
This too.

765
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,200
Why are you all so handsome?

766
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
How tall are you?

767
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,480
Almost the same height.

768
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,520
So handsome.

769
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,600
No.

770
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,200
Look.

771
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,040
The eyes of the parents are shining.

772
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
Tientsin people are very enthusiastic.

773
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,520
Yes.

774
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,560
Which one?

775
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,400
Which one?

776
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,120
1983.

777
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,640
A man.

778
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,120
This is a bit good, to be honest.

779
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,520
I know him.

780
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,680
more than 1.59 meters.

781
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm over 1.59 meters.

782
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,360
Go. You can't.

783
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,320
1.9 meters.

784
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
Maybe not.

785
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,320
He's so handsome.

786
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Someone likes the soup.

787
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,600
Popular.

788
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,680
So popular.

789
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,720
He's handsome.

790
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,280
He looks like Fei Xiang.

791
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,840
He got it right away.

792
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,640
So handsome.

793
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,440
So handsome.

794
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,200
Why are you so handsome?

795
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,600
How pretty.

796
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
Absolutely beautiful.

797
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,600
He's really handsome.

798
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,320
A beautiful scenery.

799
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,400
Thank you, uncle.

800
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,840
Handsome guys are looking for pretty girls

801
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm a little shy.

802
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,360
That young man

803
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,720
No, this young man...

804
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,720
learn Tientsin dialect.

805
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,680
Tientsin dialect.

806
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
I think they look kind.

807
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Sister or auntie?

808
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,920
Sister.

809
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,960
Can you teach us some Tientsin dialect?

810
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,800
Are you from Tianjin?

811
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,280
Are you a local?

812
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,560
Okay.

813
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
Can you speak Tientsin dialect?

814
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,200
Okay.

815
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,760
Thank you.

816
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,400
Excuse me.

817
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
It's okay.

818
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,240
Sir, can you speak Tientsin dialect?

819
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,160
Yes.

820
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,680
Can you teach us?

821
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,840
Do you want to learn?

822
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,720
Yes.

823
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,040
Have you eaten?

824
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,240
Where are you going?

825
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,640
Can you remember this tune?

826
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,560
Have you eaten?

827
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,880
Where are you going?

828
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,800
I want to learn how to say

829
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,920
how to say I like you.

830
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
I like you so much.

831
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,560
I like you so much.

832
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
I've learned it.

833
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,360
What?

834
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Tell me.

835
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
You look like Jackson Wang.

836
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,880
I've learned it.

837
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
You sound like a foreigner.

838
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,000
You're a foreigner.

839
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,520
How do I say I miss you?

840
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,560
I've never said that in my life.

841
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
You make him shy.

842
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,440
Sir.

843
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
I haven't said this for a long time.

844
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
How do I say I miss you?

845
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
I miss you.

846
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
It's cold. Wear more clothes.

847
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,720
Sir, I want to learn more.

848
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
It's getting cold. Wear more.

849
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,280
You've learned it all.

850
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,000
Put on more clothes.

851
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
Are you two lovers?

852
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes.

853
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,360
No.

854
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,920
It looks like it.

855
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,080
You didn't even grab Terri.

856
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
I'm writing it down.

857
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,000
It has a face.

858
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Fatty really doesn't care about Terri.

859
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,080
He's already focused on his language.

860
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,720
Don't.

861
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,680
You don't care about me anymore.

862
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
No.

863
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
No, just kidding.

864
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,560
He doesn't like me.

865
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
She thinks I'm not enough.

866
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
What is Tae-seo doing?

867
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,360
Tae-seo is running away.

868
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,800
He doesn't dare to look up.

869
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Sir, let's take another look.

870
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,080
Thank you, sir.

871
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,560
Bye.

872
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,760
I like you.

873
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,680
Wear more clothes when it's cold.

874
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
Yinbo.

875
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,200
How old are you?

876
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Write down the documents I gave you.

877
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,880
Sure.

878
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,080
She's actually talking to Tae-ri.

879
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,480
Height.

880
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,400
180 cm.

881
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,080
Height.

882
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,640
1.85 meters.

883
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,240
Weight.

884
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,880
No weight

885
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,400
Weight.

886
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,160
Are you polite?

887
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,680
You said that with your girlfriend.

888
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,440
She's not my girlfriend.

889
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
This is my girlfriend.

890
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,880
Yes.

891
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Okay, bye.

892
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,320
Fatty took the initiative these few times.

893
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,760
But Hua's reaction is

894
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,800
Fatty, you take the initiative.

895
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,760
I'll look for Terri's reaction right away.

896
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,680
Mr. Lynn.

897
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,920
What kind of psychological movement is this?

898
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,680
We talked about this before.

899
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,760
Flower may

900
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,600
Sometimes,

901
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
she wants to verify your love for me.

902
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,320
if your love for me

903
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,800
strong enough?

904
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,440
Clear.

905
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
Yes, confirm.

906
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,800
So she probably wants to

907
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,160
how Tarri will react

908
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,840
Tae-seo will react.

909
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,960
But he doesn't give girls any misunderstanding.

910
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,520
You don't care at all?

911
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,800
Yes.

912
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm worried about that too.

913
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,000
So it's Terri's

914
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
of Terri.

915
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,520
He might have to do it.

916
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,240
Maybe he won't

917
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
in front of Fatty.

918
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,960
What are they doing?

919
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,080
Tae-seo should say, "Not yet."

920
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,440
It's a bit...

921
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,040
Yes.

922
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Maybe.

923
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,280
Yes.

924
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,680
Uncle, teach me some Tientsin dialect.

925
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,640
We're talking in Tientsin dialect.

926
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,960
How can a dog ignore a bun?

927
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,880
The dog ignores the bun.

928
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,800
Dog.

929
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,800
The dog ignores the buns.

930
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,760
How beautiful!

931
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,120
Are you from Tianjin?

932
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,960
She's from Beijing.

933
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,120
Isn't Beijing called Little Girl?

934
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,720
Girl.

935
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
I learned it too.

936
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Girl.

937
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,680
Thank you.

938
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,240
Thank you.

939
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,320
Thank you.

940
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,640
Okay.

941
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
Thank you.

942
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,160
I feel embarrassed.

943
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,440
I have social phobia.

944
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,960
Let's go upstairs.

945
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,680
From the perspective of an idol drama.

946
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,280
My legs are weak.

947
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,680
Step back.

948
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,160
You can't fall from this height, can you?

949
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,280
No, I'm afraid of heights.

950
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,200
What about those ones?

951
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,840
They learned it secretly.

952
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,400
I think we learned a lot.

953
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,160
The dog ignores the buns.

954
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
Hello.

955
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,680
It's CJ.

956
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,400
What else?

957
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
This guy is really...

958
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Great.

959
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,560
Are you 1.9m tall?

960
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Five sentences.

961
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
Five lines already.

962
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,280
Are you 1.9m tall?

963
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
Okay, I've learned enough.

964
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
Good match.

965
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,960
Yes, the more I look at it, the more I look at it.

966
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,880
Sweet.

967
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,640
The view is so beautiful.

968
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,200
Give me a hug.

969
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Let's eat candy.

970
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,720
Let's go.

971
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,560
Are you still cold?

972
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,040
No.

973
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,240
It's not cold when the sun shines.

974
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,240
Where did they go?

975
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,800
Tell me secretly.

976
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,120
1994.

977
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,920
Which year are you in?

978
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,000
1997.

979
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,880
She was born in 1996.

980
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,520
Really?

981
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,400
1996

982
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,520
I was born in 1996. What's wrong with you?

983
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,040
No.

984
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,280
Tell me. Which year are you in?

985
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,080
I don't know.

986
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
I was born in 1997.

987
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
You were born in 1997.

988
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,800
March.

989
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,920
You're in 1997. I'll be the biggest.

990
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm already January 9.

991
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
I'll pay you back in a month.

992
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,200
It's only a few months older than me.

993
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,800
Yes.

994
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,960
That's big too.

995
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Both are older than her.

996
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,880
I know.

997
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,760
Tae-seo is five months older than me.

998
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
So it doesn't affect

999
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
in the future.

1000
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,640
Most importantly,

1001
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,880
not age.

1002
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
Hua once said

1003
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,840
she doesn't like younger girls.

1004
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,760
Today, she was younger than me when we talked about age.

1005
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,160
I was quite happy

1006
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,880
to hear this.

1007
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,920
How to say? Are you done?

1008
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,600
Who are you referring to?

1009
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,640
It's Jisugu.

1010
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,320
Who is it?

1011
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Are you 1.9m tall?

1012
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,360
Why do you sound like

1013
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,600
a foreigner?

1014
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,520
You're 1.9 meters tall.

1015
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,160
Me too.

1016
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,120
You won't. You're not right.

1017
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,880
Handsome.

1018
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,320
Handsome.

1019
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,760
So handsome.

1020
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
You're all so handsome.

1021
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,240
Let's go.

1022
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,560
Are you happy?

1023
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,200
Yes.

1024
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,520
Take a walk.

1025
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,480
I passed by the square yesterday.

1026
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Is this where we were yesterday?

1027
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,280
Are you cold?

1028
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Shall we walk in the sunlight?

1029
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,920
I think so too.

1030
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,200
Let's go inside.

1031
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Flower is with Terri.

1032
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,120
Fatty is in the middle of the hourglass.

1033
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Yes.

1034
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,000
In the middle of you.

1035
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,120
Where are you going so fast?

1036
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,840
She's cold.

1037
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,440
Who's cold?

1038
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,880
Beauty.

1039
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Is it pretty?

1040
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,440
But why didn't it start recording?

1041
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,960
I started recording.

1042
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,440
Where are we?

1043
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,880
Min Park Square.

1044
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,080
I just found out.

1045
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,120
Min Park Square.

1046
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,680
Okay.

1047
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,040
Take a look. Turn around.

1048
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,800
Why are you following us?

1049
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,400
The look in your eyes.

1050
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,440
Rath.

1051
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay, that's all for now.

1052
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,320
You deduct. You still have a turn, right?

1053
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,400
I don't know what to say.

1054
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,480
The little boy's love can't be hidden.

1055
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,960
We've always been like this

1056
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,760
like this.

1057
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,680
They look like a couple.

1058
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,360
I'll keep recording

1059
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,000
The focus is on me.

1060
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They look great together.

1061
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,720
No, this face is too big.

1062
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,080
No, my face is wider than yours.

1063
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,760
No.

1064
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Pull your hair away.

1065
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,840
No.

1066
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,199
Susu is so beautiful under the sun.

1067
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,639
Smile.

1068
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,040
Susu is good-looking.

1069
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,560
Yes.

1070
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:24,840
Yes.

1071
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
The more I look at it, the more beautiful it is.

1072
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
Don't steal others' balls.

1073
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Are you cold?

1074
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm fine.

1075
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,239
Let me take a photo for you.

1076
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you want a photo?

1077
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
Yes.

1078
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
Is it pretty?

1079
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
I can't see clearly.

1080
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,320
Yes, because you may have some reflection.

1081
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,840
OK.

1082
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,320
Sunshine.

1083
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,920
I trust you.

1084
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Let's go over there.

1085
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,840
Let's buy a ball.

1086
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Let's go.

1087
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
They are roommates.

1088
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,760
He's asking for help

1089
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,920
The kids are crying too.

1090
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
Why doesn't Fatty join "war"?

1091
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,760
Forget it.

1092
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Forget it.

1093
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,720
He's a little upset.

1094
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,320
He's eager to get an answer.

1095
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,200
I think he might gradually understand

1096
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,960
Yes.

1097
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,600
Age is his last straw.

1098
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,400
The last hope.

1099
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,080
No hope.

1100
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Let's put it aside.

1101
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,440
even if age

1102
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
is revealed,

1103
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,880
if Fatty should take it,

1104
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,320
do I have to keep going?

1105
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,000
I didn't say

1106
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I didn't say I don't want him at all.

1107
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,840
I don't think it depends.

1108
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
Fatty should ask your heart.

1109
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,440
if you like flowers.

1110
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
If you really like it, keep working hard.

1111
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,240
And his hard work

1112
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,840
he has to find

1113
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,400
a formal way to work hard.

1114
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,920
You can't always say that

1115
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,680
This is my girlfriend.

1116
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,720
The girls might think

1117
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,440
you're joking.

1118
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,000
Maybe you just like to

1119
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,800
domineering dramas.

1120
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,040
And I'll also think that

1121
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,600
Just confess your love seriously, right?

1122
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,480
Yes, be honest.

1123
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
He confessed all over the world.

1124
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,880
He has no idea about his love.

1125
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
That's enough to confess.

1126
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm not serious.

1127
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,640
It's not formal.

1128
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,080
Isn't this...

1129
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,720
We need to be more formal.

1130
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,360
And it's not continuous enough.

1131
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,520
I can't see clearly.

1132
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
The sun is too bright.

1133
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,200
I'll believe you.

1134
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,920
It's pretty.

1135
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,480
Pretty.

1136
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,720
I can't see clearly.

1137
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,440
Pretty.

1138
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Yinbo.

1139
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,840
OK.

1140
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Good for you.

1141
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,120
Like a puppy.

1142
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,160
Happy puppy.

1143
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,520
Hello.

1144
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm speechless.

1145
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,880
Let's take a video.

1146
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,400
The light is nice.

1147
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,880
We need to look pretty.

1148
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,920
Yes, face.

1149
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,040
Take a photo for me.

1150
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,600
Take a photo for me.

1151
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,880
Take a photo with my phone.

1152
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,360
You asked Tae-seo to do it.

1153
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,680
The color is wrong.

1154
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,960
Bobo, teach me how to pose.

1155
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
How to shoot a ball?

1156
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,680
Raise the ball.

1157
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,120
Can it float?

1158
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Yes.

1159
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,280
Good.

1160
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,200
Not bad.

1161
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,640
Let me take a photo for you.

1162
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Do you know the professional quality of a model?

1163
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,080
It's pretty.

1164
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,840
Tae-seo, you'll thank me later.

1165
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
It's pretty.

1166
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,080
Look, she's taking a photo for Terri.

1167
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,320
But she doesn't help Fatty.

1168
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,280
Forget it, Fatty.

1169
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,400
I think we should forget it.

1170
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
Let's really forget it.

1171
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,640
Let's go.

1172
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,040
There's a carriage over there.

1173
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,440
Sure.

1174
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,280
Let's go.

1175
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,360
You can leave now, Fatty.

1176
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,520
It's time.

1177
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,280
I've tried. That's enough.

1178
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll sit with Bobo.

1179
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,800
Why?

1180
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,120
I don't understand.

1181
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,680
Hua, why didn't you

1182
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,160
with Bo?

1183
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

1184
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
They went up first.

1185
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,000
They sat in the back.

1186
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,640
But I thought

1187
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,000
if I do it now,

1188
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,800
I'll be

1189
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,000
between them.

1190
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It was awkward.

1191
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,720
Then I sat

1192
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,840
at the side corner.

1193
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,000
It's too cold.

1194
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,280
You can take off the soup?

1195
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,960
What?

1196
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,760
You can take it off?

1197
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,640
I have a vest.

1198
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
He wants to wear it for Susu.

1199
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,160
No, she...

1200
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,600
Her short skirt. I think she's too cold.

1201
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,600
Okay.

1202
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
Thank you.

1203
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
This boyfriend power.

1204
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,440
We're taking a carriage on the Five Avenue.

1205
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,520
It's stuck together.

1206
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,800
Stick it.

1207
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,840
We are...

1208
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,240
Yes, we're three third third wheels.

1209
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,320
The third wheel.

1210
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,960
Okay.

1211
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,840
He took the initiative.

1212
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
The soup is on the rocket-like speed.

1213
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,960
Yes.

1214
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,720
Very good.

1215
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,400
Soup.

1216
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,600
Hello.

1217
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,720
You've improved, young man.

1218
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,880
Hello.

1219
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
This is a relic.

1220
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,200
Rich

1221
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,240
Fulai

1222
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,080
So sweet

1223
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,400
He's enlightened.

1224
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,960
Great.

1225
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
Finally

1226
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,600
in this world of fast rhythm,

1227
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,960
Take a break.

1228
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
There's a place where you can stop like this.

1229
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
Love can make a man grow.

1230
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,960
Yes.

1231
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,920
So warm.

1232
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,880
It's so bright now

1233
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,240
Sweet.

1234
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,320
Let's go to the crosstalk show.

1235
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,080
Really?

1236
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,840
Really?

1237
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,320
Let’s go.

1238
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,360
Jiang Dunhao,

1239
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,720
is

1240
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,920
the exclusive background music of sweet partners.

1241
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,960
It's an honor to be their exclusive.

1242
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,640
You'll find that

1243
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,120
after the Cat Cafe incident,

1244
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,640
Su Su and soup

1245
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Ride the rocket.

1246
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,720
To a good direction.

1247
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,000
He drove without looking back.

1248
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,440
Yes

1249
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,080
I was so emotional just now.

1250
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,480
The soup has improved a lot.

1251
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,120
Every time,

1252
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,880
every time he experienced something,

1253
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,360
he will grow up.

1254
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,080
Yes.

1255
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,760
And every time I ascend, you know?

1256
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Learning ability.

1257
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,160
Yeah, he understands the others.

1258
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,840
Then he can change it right away.

1259
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,880
It's a bonus.

1260
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,120
Before the soup,

1261
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,440
before the soup.

1262
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,280
because he didn't want girls to feel offended.

1263
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,520
or too gentle?

1264
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,760
He's a good person.

1265
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,560
Tientsin Ancient Cultural Street.

1266
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,680
Take a look.

1267
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,040
So many people.

1268
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,840
So many people today.

1269
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,600
So lively.

1270
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,600
We can buy something as souvenirs.

1271
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,120
What is it?

1272
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,720
Let's take a look.

1273
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,480
There are so many people in line.

1274
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Isn't it delicious?

1275
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,920
And shadow puppets.

1276
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,080
I came to Tianjin.

1277
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,120
I didn't learn it.

1278
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,240
Osmanthus cake.

1279
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,720
Ma'am, one osmanthus cake.

1280
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,040
It's sticky.

1281
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,720
This is my favorite.

1282
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,040
I want some too.

1283
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,800
Take one.

1284
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
Delicious.

1285
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,320
Not bad.

1286
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,760
Don't you want pancakes?

1287
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,480
Have one.

1288
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,600
Do you want scallion spicy sauce?

1289
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,200
Yes.

1290
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,240
How do you say pancakes in Tientsin dialect?

1291
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Pancake fruit.

1292
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,560
A set of pancake fruit.

1293
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,600
Got it?

1294
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Pancake fruit.

1295
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,200
Tientsin Fruits.

1296
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,280
Handsome.

1297
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Two beauties are more beautiful.

1298
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,360
Thank you.

1299
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,240
Da-jun.

1300
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,000
Da Jun.

1301
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
I got it.

1302
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,640
We learned how to make pancakes.

1303
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,320
Fried crispy meat.

1304
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm going to buy some.

1305
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,080
This way.

1306
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,080
One each.

1307
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,280
Holy pancake fruit, one set.

1308
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,320
A set of pancakes.

1309
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,960
Learn from me.

1310
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,920
A set of pancakes.

1311
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,880
What's wrong?

1312
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,680
I bit it.

1313
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,560
What's wrong?

1314
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,960
He's pretending.

1315
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
He bit his mouth.

1316
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
He wants to draw your attention every day.

1317
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,960
He sees through the way we get along

1318
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,560
I want Mi's comfort.

1319
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,520
Yes.

1320
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,640
I want Mi every day.

1321
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,120
What's wrong, Tu?

1322
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,320
It's so fun to watch love scenes.

1323
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,200
Let's go.

1324
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,600
Give me that.

1325
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,280
I'll throw it away.

1326
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:47,520
Okay.

1327
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,360
I'll throw it away for you.

1328
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,240
It smells good.

1329
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,200
Have one.

1330
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,400
Do you want some?

1331
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,520
Yes.

1332
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,320
Thank you.

1333
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,640
I'm leaving.

1334
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,120
Break it.

1335
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,720
This is mung bean cake.

1336
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,440
Handmade mung bean cake.

1337
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,160
Mung bean cake.

1338
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,000
What's this?

1339
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,520
This is

1340
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,120
It comes out one by one.

1341
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,840
Can we try this?

1342
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,560
Yes.

1343
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,120
Just take a glove.

1344
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,520
Okay.

1345
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,640
I want a massage too.

1346
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,160
I feel relieved

1347
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,240
Is it fun?

1348
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,480
It's good.

1349
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,560
Tu.

1350
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,960
Don't go back to school.

1351
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,040
Stay in Tianjin.

1352
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,000
Tianjin needs you.

1353
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,680
Come on.

1354
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,160
What's the point

1355
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,720
Like this?

1356
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,400
Yes.

1357
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,800
So you're tightening it, right?

1358
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,240
It's like hitting a mole.

1359
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,720
Hit the mole.

1360
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,920
It's fun.

1361
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,360
Finished.

1362
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,800
Yes, after it's done,

1363
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,840
it will be smashed one by one.

1364
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,480
Yes.

1365
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,400
Are you interested in this?

1366
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,160
What is this?

1367
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,520
Haven't you seen it before?

1368
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,600
Never.

1369
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,000
This is...

1370
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,200
This is a traditional Chinese dessert.

1371
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,120
You can eat it when you drink tea.

1372
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,840
Is this sweet?

1373
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,360
Basically.

1374
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,600
It's delicious.

1375
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,840
Where are you from?

1376
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Italy.

1377
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,920
Yes.

1378
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
Are you coming to Beijing or Tianjin?

1379
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,120
Tianjin.

1380
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,800
Are you here for a trip?

1381
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,320
Do you like this place?

1382
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,320
Yes.

1383
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,680
This place is fun, right?

1384
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,480
Let's go.

1385
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,880
We have to go somewhere else.

1386
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,400
Have a good day.

1387
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,560
Have fun.

1388
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,520
Thank you.

1389
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,400
The picture follows in English immediately.

1390
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,520
He was wondering why

1391
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,800
so good in Chinese.

1392
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,360
The mud man Zhang Art Museum.

1393
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,480
Welcome to the mud man Zhang art museum.

1394
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,840
This is squeezed out.

1395
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,800
It's not left behind.

1396
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,480
Amazing.

1397
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,160
Most of the works

1398
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,720
of the exhibition.

1399
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,680
You can follow me

1400
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,800
Let's take a look at the first centre.

1401
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,360
What you see here

1402
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,200
is a photo of the six generations of the Clay Man Zhang family.

1403
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,960
The founder is in the middle.

1404
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,040
Mr. Zhang Mingshan.

1405
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Our host

1406
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,080
is Mr. Jang Yu.

1407
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,320
The successor of the Sixth Generation.

1408
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,600
Now, if we're here,

1409
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,800
we will show

1410
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,480
and the non-material cultural heritage in Tientsin.

1411
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
the first Mr. Zhang Mingshan

1412
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,440
during his first practice.

1413
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,000
It is said that a piece of this size

1414
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,440
can be done in the sleeves.

1415
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,080
Crush blindly.

1416
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,760
Yes, it's all in your hands.

1417
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,840
Awesome.

1418
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,600
So cute.

1419
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,440
This row

1420
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,760
are the first founders.

1421
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,200
Mr. Zhang Mingshan.

1422
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,280
These works

1423
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,920
around 1780 years.

1424
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,760
His works are based on

1425
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,200
based on real characters.

1426
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,520
Will the color not fade?

1427
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,240
No.

1428
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
The paint on our work

1429
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
is mineral paint.

1430
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,480
If this color is saturated,

1431
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,520
it will be 40 to 50 times.

1432
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,880
This way

1433
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,760
is the second museum of our museum.

1434
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,000
This group is the work of a prostitute.

1435
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,200
It's the descendants of the 234th generation.

1436
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,800
to work together.

1437
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,920
God of Wealth.

1438
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Yes, God of Fortune.

1439
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,480
A lot of customers are here.

1440
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,760
as wallpaper.

1441
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,320
Take a picture.

1442
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,800
Take the money.

1443
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,040
This person created the God of Wealth.

1444
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,880
This one here...

1445
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,560
for nothing.

1446
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,680
Take a look at the price.

1447
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,840
Eight million.

1448
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,800
Why is this...

1449
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,440
That's right.

1450
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,520
All of our works

1451
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,160
belong to top two cultural relics.

1452
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,000
This work is more meaningful.

1453
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,960
It will help China

1454
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,280
for Chinese medical treatment.

1455
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,760
At the same time,

1456
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,440
he made three

1457
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,160
he made three pieces in total.

1458
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,880
One is kept in the Chinese museum.

1459
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,280
One was in 2002.

1460
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,560
at the auction in Singapore,

1461
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,640
at the auction in Singapore.

1462
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,640
This is the last one.

1463
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,360
And this is

1464
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,760
an essay for primary school.

1465
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,360
The illustrations of commemorating the White Letters

1466
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
is the picture of this work.

1467
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,560
Monthly Magazine of Chinese Art.

1468
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,680
The cover of the first week

1469
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,840
for the first issue of Weekly Magazine.

1470
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,040
So the price will be higher.

1471
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,320
We've seen

1472
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,240
the clay man Mr. Zhang Yu pinched.

1473
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,400
Six generations.

1474
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,520
They've passed down from generation to generation.

1475
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,200
Over 200 years,

1476
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,640
and passed down a technology.

1477
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,960
That's why they're called aristocratic families.

1478
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,160
So I think it's very vivid.

1479
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,800
Look at those mud people.

1480
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,080
Look at those colors.

1481
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,000
Most of them are from more than 100 years ago.

1482
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,040
It hasn't dropped yet.

1483
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,920
I think it's amazing.

1484
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
No wonder it's not legacy.

1485
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,200
To be honest,

1486
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,520
when you are immersed in

1487
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,360
this culture

1488
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,600
of this culture,

1489
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,520
you can feel

1490
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,880
the shock from the clay Zhang.

1491
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,600
They make mud people

1492
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,880
all kinds of polishing and coloring.

1493
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,880
and reflection.

1494
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,200
It makes you feel

1495
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,520
very meaningful.

1496
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,080
I fell in love with Tianjin after this episode.

1497
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,760
I want to travel.

1498
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,040
Yes.

1499
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
Can you invite the God of Wealth to my house?

1500
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,000
I really need it.

1501
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,560
Me too.

1502
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,360
Change it into wallpaper.

1503
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,040
Sure.

1504
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,840
I've changed it.

1505
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,720
Yes.

1506
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,480
You're too active.

1507
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,280
God of Wealth will see your sincerity.

1508
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,160
Yes.

1509
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,320
Sachet. Sachet.

1510
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,800
Take a look.

1511
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,840
Go in and take a look

1512
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,560
Take a look.

1513
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,440
Does it smell good?

1514
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,200
Smell it.

1515
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,400
Perfume cream.

1516
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,120
Apply this here.

1517
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,480
for 12 hours.

1518
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,640
Thank you.

1519
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,680
It smells good.

1520
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,400
Smell this.

1521
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,040
What new method is this?

1522
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,560
I don't know.

1523
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,120
You don't know.

1524
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,520
That's how you hit others.

1525
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,000
It's my first time being hit.

1526
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,880
Smell it.

1527
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,400
It's poisonous.

1528
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,120
I'm speechless.

1529
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,680
I thought you were going to tell me something.

1530
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,640
Let's go.

1531
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,240
Let's go.

1532
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,840
I miss you in Tianjin.

1533
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,640
Roasted pears. Have one.

1534
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Little pear soup.

1535
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,160
I want it.

1536
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,200
Learn this.

1537
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,360
How do you say that in Tientsin dialect?

1538
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,920
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.

1539
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,400
Really?

1540
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,280
I miss you in Tianjin.

1541
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,560
I miss you.

1542
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,280
I miss you in Tianjin.

1543
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,240
What's wrong with the scarf?

1544
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
You two...

1545
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,120
What's wrong, scarf?

1546
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,880
I don't know.

1547
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,120
It's a bit stuck in my neck.

1548
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,120
Is your neck stuck?

1549
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,840
Yes.

1550
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,520
A little.

1551
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,840
Let's go.

1552
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,120
Look over there.

1553
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,160
So sweet.

1554
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,760
Yes

1555
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,920
You were so sweet in 2002.

1556
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,480
I'm speechless.

1557
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,760
Don't talk to kids in 2004.

1558
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,000
This way.

1559
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,640
Let's take a look here.

1560
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,640
This one.

1561
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,720
sandalwood.

1562
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
I want sandalwood.

1563
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,520
Susanxiang?

1564
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,280
Is it the kind that can calm down

1565
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,640
when you smell it?

1566
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,120
I need this kind of calmness.

1567
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,240
Me too.

1568
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,720
It smells so good.

1569
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,560
OK.

1570
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,280
Let's make two.

1571
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,000
Sure.

1572
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,720
Which one do you want?

1573
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,920
This looks like when I was in school.

1574
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,120
Do you have rhinitis?

1575
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,440
I do.

1576
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,280
It can relieve your nose.

1577
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,960
So funny.

1578
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,720
My nose got infected for a while.

1579
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,440
How?

1580
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,960
Sister let's make two

1581
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,600
You pick first.

1582
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,840
Which medicine bag do you want?

1583
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,320
Right here?

1584
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,440
What color do you want

1585
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,800
Green one.

1586
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,280
Green one is good.

1587
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,360
I'll take this.

1588
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,680
Which beauty do you want?

1589
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,920
The sandalwood you just gave me

1590
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,120
just now.

1591
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,720
I want this too.

1592
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,600
If you choose,

1593
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,920
what color are you interested in?

1594
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,360
I really want to see you.

1595
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,880
your makeup is thicker.

1596
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,080
I'll put on heavy makeup for you on the last day.

1597
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,560
Yes.

1598
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,080
Okay.

1599
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,720
That kind of red lips.

1600
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,760
OK. Let's do it.

1601
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,080
OK.

1602
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,560
It's scary.

1603
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,600
So scary.

1604
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,440
Like stepmother.

1605
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,520
The "stepmother Tea Party".

1606
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,320
Don't talk to you.

1607
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,440
Do you have EQ?

1608
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,200
He doesn't understand.

1609
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,360
Because he's more out of his league.

1610
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,520
He's more scared.

1611
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,160
It's scary.

1612
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,240
Map.

1613
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,320
Can I buy you a suit?

1614
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,160
Okay.

1615
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,560
I'll put the one with 10 cm.

1616
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,760
I'll buy you height increasing insoles.

1617
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,360
Okay.

1618
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,000
Okay.

1619
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,600
Okay.

1620
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,160
How is it going?

1621
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,080
They made the sachet.

1622
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,040
Take a look.

1623
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,560
Don't disturb them.

1624
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
We'll come back later.

1625
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,720
Yes.

1626
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,560
Let's find some fun.

1627
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:37,800
OK?

1628
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,520
Let's find something fun ourselves.

1629
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,720
The story of Tom's family.

1630
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,360
Official authorization.

1631
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,000
He lives in your life.

1632
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,840
Xiao Ling.

1633
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,960
Tom is everywhere.

1634
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,720
Love, Xiaoling?

1635
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,640
I love you so much.

1636
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,480
You haven't seen Tom for so long.

1637
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,200
Do you miss him?

1638
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,360
I don't miss him at all.

1639
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,280
Do you love him?

1640
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,040
So much love

1641
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,240
Hot steamed buns.

1642
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,520
Hot "soup".

1643
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,160
You love it so much.

1644
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,600
Then they will say,

1645
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,640
"I'm crazy."

1646
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,320
Oh no, this woman loves it so much.

1647
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,520
She's crazy.

1648
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Let's have some.

1649
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,320
Buy one.

1650
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,000
Okay.

1651
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,280
All meat buns, right?

1652
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,440
The dog ignores the buns.

1653
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,840
Let's have one.

1654
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,720
One.

1655
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,760
Tientsin dogs ignore buns.

1656
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,480
We want to eat too.

1657
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,240
It looks delicious.

1658
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,480
Tientsin dogs ignore buns.

1659
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,640
Tu, are you happy?

1660
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,960
We're sitting around you.

1661
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,560
I'm so happy.

1662
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,160
I've been taking you away.

1663
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,400
Aren't you eating?

1664
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,640
I'll eat.

1665
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,720
If Xiao Ling gets closer to you today,

1666
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,080
I'll squeeze between you two.

1667
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,640
Okay.

1668
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,960
Just a little closer.

1669
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,720
They can make sachets for so long.

1670
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,000
They must want to make it as long as possible.

1671
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,840
They want to give each other sachets.

1672
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,040
A love token.

1673
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,200
Does it smell now?

1674
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,440
Does it smell?

1675
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,640
I smell perfume.

1676
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,560
I smell your perfume.

1677
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,640
I didn't.

1678
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,240
Bye.

1679
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,640
Thank you.

1680
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,200
Thank you.

1681
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,720
Thank you.

1682
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,440
Can you do it yourself?

1683
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,560
Of course.

1684
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,000
Whose finger is this big?

1685
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:08,880
Mine.

1686
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,200
Really?

1687
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,800
See how big it is.

1688
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,800
So scary.

1689
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,920
Is this garlic

1690
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,200
Yes.

1691
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,640
So cute.

1692
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,240
I'll buy it for you.

1693
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,480
Buy it for me.

1694
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,400
Forget it.

1695
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,880
So cute.

1696
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,720
Even a turtle.

1697
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,880
Let me give you a ride.

1698
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,600
I'll give you a turtle.

1699
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,680
Give me a garlic.

1700
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,360
I'll buy you a turtle.

1701
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,200
I'll buy garlic for you.

1702
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,960
Gourd.

1703
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,080
Let's go.

1704
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,800
Where's the map?

1705
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,040
Where are they?

1706
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,240
They are over there.

1707
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,800
Go find them.

1708
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
They are cooking.

1709
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,160
Come on.

1710
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,480
You two know to come back.

1711
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,520
We're looking for you.

1712
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,280
Let's go.

1713
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,000
Let's go.

1714
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,840
Let's go to the next stop.

1715
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,760
There's a Tianjin folk museum here.

1716
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,920
Take a look.

1717
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,680
Welcome to Tientsin Folk Museum.

1718
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,240
There's a script game

1719
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,000
to you.

1720
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,320
And the script game.

1721
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,520
Tientsin feels different.

1722
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,760
Guys,

1723
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,800
Ancestors are reflected.

1724
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,200
Yes.

1725
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,120
Tientsin has been established

1726
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,960
has been established for 620 years.

1727
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,080
It's the only city

1728
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,600
of birth.

1729
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,920
Then why is there

1730
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,920
interesting characteristics?

1731
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,040
are all about

1732
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,760
the integrity of Tientsin.

1733
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,400
Watch the steps.

1734
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,560
Please come in.

1735
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,960
Look at these blue backwalls.

1736
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,400
in these blue walls.

1737
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,560
Boats

1738
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,560
and bridge.

1739
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,680
It represents Tianjin

1740
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,240
is born from water transport.

1741
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
Let's look over here.

1742
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,680
This is actually

1743
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,960
a map

1744
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,480
is one meter longer.

1745
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,200
It is a painter Jiang Xuan

1746
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
of the Qing Dynasty.

1747
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,240
He painted it.

1748
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,640
Let's scan it with our phone.

1749
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,840
with your phone

1750
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,240
to solve the mystery.

1751
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,320
There are many lanterns inside.

1752
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,240
Let's start with the Tientsin armor map.

1753
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,840
Then we turn around and look here.

1754
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,560
We were holding

1755
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,640
a map

1756
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,560
there will be a map.

1757
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,400
Let's look for it.

1758
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,760
the corresponding words in this picture.

1759
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,800
the hint

1760
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,320
and put the answer on your phone.

1761
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,040
on your phone.

1762
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,240
In this way, through reading,

1763
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,800
we learned about the ancient city in Tientsin

1764
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,800
in Tientsin.

1765
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,720
There are two people here.

1766
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,560
One is Ms. Li.

1767
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,960
and the other is Mr Ge.

1768
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,720
Where did they go?

1769
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,800
The place where my ancestors lived.

1770
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
is close to the rice sauna.

1771
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,320
Guandi Temple.

1772
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,920
And then?

1773
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,840
That's all.

1774
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
According to Mrs. Li's description,

1775
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,440
we can see

1776
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,240
it's actually

1777
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,640
We live near the rice dryer.

1778
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,680
It's Guandi Temple when we go out.

1779
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,760
Cross the bridge alley

1780
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,160
and go west along the east street,

1781
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
you'll hear 108 bells.

1782
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,040
Go west on the east street.

1783
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,840
That's Drum Tower.

1784
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,440
The centre of Tientsin is Drum Tower.

1785
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,280
The other is Mr Ge.

1786
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,760
If they pass through the fence,

1787
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,280
go east along the west street.

1788
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,440
If you cross the bridge alley,

1789
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,120
you can come to the prayer place.

1790
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,520
Fire Immortal Temple?

1791
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,320
So the answer is Drum Tower and Fire Immortal Temple.

1792
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,240
In Tianjin,

1793
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,360
there were only bells without drums on the drum tower.

1794
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,760
It rings 108 times a day.

1795
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,440
represents the morning and night bell.

1796
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,280
Open the city gate and close the city gate.

1797
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
The show here

1798
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,720
some Chinese New Year customs.

1799
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,000
lanterns and old things.

1800
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,920
Besides, there is another feature

1801
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,640
in Tianjin.

1802
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,280
Tianjin needs to work in the morning.

1803
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,440
in the morning.

1804
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,600
So we get married this afternoon.

1805
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,920
We'll be free in the afternoon.

1806
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,680
Yes, only in the afternoon.

1807
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,640
Yes, you're right.

1808
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,480
I don't have time in the morning.

1809
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,400
What about tonight?

1810
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,720
In the evening.

1811
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,520
The bridal chamber.

1812
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,680
It's already the wedding night.

1813
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,880
You're good at asking questions.

1814
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,480
It's important.

1815
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,560
When we get to this area,

1816
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,000
we can see the pharmacies in Tianjin.

1817
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,440
This is replicating the old pharmacy.

1818
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,800
There's a shopkeeper here.

1819
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,160
Welcome to Zeren Pharmacy.

1820
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,520
Hello.

1821
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,240
There's something important here.

1822
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,880
Something important?

1823
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,600
Yes.

1824
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,280
Look what this is

1825
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,080
Here we go.

1826
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,400
This is Tientsin dialect.

1827
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,040
Tientsin dialect. Yes.

1828
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,480
Garlic.

1829
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,800
Extra.

1830
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,000
This is called mixing garlic.

1831
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,720
Creation, white egg, glutinous pear,

1832
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,920
and silver resistance.

1833
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,000
Tell us first.

1834
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,800
It means cute.

1835
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,680
It's really silver-resistant.

1836
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,560
So annoying.

1837
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,000
That's an opposite word.

1838
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,200
Great.

1839
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,560
Yes.

1840
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,920
describe girls.

1841
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,960
So cute.

1842
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,800
Silver.

1843
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,120
Cute.

1844
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:46,960
Yes.

1845
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,760
It's really durable.

1846
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,520
Big pear.

1847
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,040
Big pear describes this person.

1848
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,920
He's carefree.

1849
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,440
Bragging.

1850
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,120
Yes.

1851
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,000
Bragging.

1852
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,960
It means bragging.

1853
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,760
Always smart.

1854
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,120
He likes to be reasonable.

1855
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,160
It describes a relationship between a man and a girlfriend.

1856
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,240
Why can't women do it?

1857
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,080
When they quarrel,

1858
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,560
How come?

1859
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,280
Lying

1860
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,080
Yeah, I can't coax him well.

1861
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,200
Little creator.

1862
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:12,680
Lucky.

1863
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,040
Yeah, a white egg.

1864
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,480
Just talking nonsense.

1865
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,040
Not really.

1866
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,160
He said he's very eloquent.

1867
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,080
He's very talkative.

1868
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:19,560
Yes.

1869
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,360
You can talk nonsense.

1870
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,160
Isn't this you?

1871
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,920
You can talk.

1872
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,080
Talk nonsense.

1873
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,440
You're talking nonsense.

1874
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,120
You're right.

1875
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,880
Yes.

1876
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,680
I can't figure out what it means.

1877
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,360
My girlfriend is bullied.

1878
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,560
What should we do?

1879
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,600
Beat him.

1880
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,120
Yes.

1881
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,560
It's to avenge others.

1882
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,760
It's about extraction.

1883
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,280
Who should I help?

1884
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,720
And the garlic.

1885
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,560
Bicker

1886
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,920
Garlic.

1887
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,760
The description is not clear or fluent.

1888
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,960
There are words mixed with garlic

1889
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,840
Stuttering

1890
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,800
Yes.

1891
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,000
That's what it means.

1892
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,320
Okay.

1893
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,640
Go forward.

1894
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,480
We've seen the first half.

1895
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,360
the characteristics of Tianjin.

1896
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,560
The second half we see is

1897
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,520
the most important part of our marriage

1898
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,200
In the old days,

1899
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,680
What's wrong with people getting married in Tientsin?

1900
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,120
How to get married?

1901
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,360
Before we get married,

1902
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,840
before we get married.

1903
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,400
and tell everyone

1904
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,520
when we are getting married.

1905
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,240
Do you see the bride and groom know each other?

1906
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,440
Li Lei, Han Mei Mei.

1907
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,800
You've done a lot of English questions.

1908
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,880
I can't believe Li Lei and Han Mei Mei.

1909
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,960
This is our match.

1910
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,320
Up there.

1911
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,920
A good match.

1912
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,240
Isn't this what blind dates used to be about?

1913
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,240
A match?

1914
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,800
Yes.

1915
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,000
We will have a deskdown culture.

1916
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,360
What is deskdown culture?

1917
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,760
Come to our yard and tell us.

1918
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,480
Come.

1919
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,840
We meet again.

1920
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,400
Let's see what's inside.

1921
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,680
Marriage.

1922
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,800
What's the name of Tianjin?

1923
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,240
It's called setting the table.

1924
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,200
Set the table.

1925
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
It's just a feast.

1926
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,240
Marriage, dinner

1927
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,200
Red and white happy events will come to prepare a feast.

1928
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,040
This scene.

1929
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,600
Let's take a look at this.

1930
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,080
It's a set. A pair.

1931
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,200
It's called thinner.

1932
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,440
A dowry?

1933
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,120
Yes.

1934
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,480
The more dowry you get,

1935
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,240
the more

1936
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,160
the bigger the wedding bed is prepared.

1937
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,960
In fact, after looking at Tientsin folk museum,

1938
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,200
may be very interested in

1939
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,000
and the origin of Tientsin,

1940
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,280
about Tientsin.

1941
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
Teach me a Tientsin dialect.

1942
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,360
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.

1943
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:08,920
I want to learn too.

1944
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,360
We want to learn.

1945
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,000
I miss you so much in Tianjin.

1946
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,240
I miss you so much.

1947
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,000
I miss you so much.

1948
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,480
Feeling

1949
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,560
Very.

1950
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,520
I miss you so much. I miss you so much.

1951
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,200
I miss you so much.

1952
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,680
Because many places are like this.

1953
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,480
I want to know how to say this in Tientsin.

1954
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,640
And if I have a chance

1955
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,160
I can say this

1956
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,800
who I'm interested in.

1957
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,520
I miss you so much in Tianjin.

1958
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,840
Tianjin is open and tolerant.

1959
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,720
I remember it clearly.

1960
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,360
The tour guide said

1961
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,640
Tianjin is a city

1962
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,600
in Tianjin.

1963
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,200
I've never heard of a city

1964
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,520
and its own birthday.

1965
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,440
So I think

1966
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,440
Tianjin is so special.

1967
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,800
Welcome to Tianjin again.

1968
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,040
Okay.

1969
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,040
Thank you.

1970
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,680
What did you say in Tientsin dialect?

1971
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,600
It's called marriage.

1972
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,200
Marriage

1973
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,960
I'm in a good mood today.

1974
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,760
Tata, Tu, Xin and Xiaoling

1975
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,280
They experienced

1976
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,760
the local characteristics of Tianjin.

1977
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,920
All of them.

1978
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,800
learn Tientsin dialect.

1979
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,160
Whether it's a museum

1980
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,760
or a sculpture,

1981
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,120
Look at that little mud man

1982
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,600
are very happy.

1983
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,160
So I think it's worth it.

1984
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,080
Let's go. We're going to be late.

1985
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,160
Get in.

1986
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,720
Go watch cross talk.

1987
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,560
We're here.

1988
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,280
Let's go.

1989
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,760
Let's go.

1990
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,840
Here we go.

1991
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,960
Hello.

1992
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,680
Hello.

1993
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,600
What a coincidence.

1994
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,280
What a coincidence.

1995
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,440
The King of Northern Song is in Bianliang City.

1996
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,120
XiLiao sent troops to attack the border court.

1997
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,600
If you ask which one has moved in,

1998
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,400
she's a female soldier from Tianbo Yang Mansion.

1999
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,320
She's not old. She's a martial artist.

2000
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,760
The girl who burned the fire is Yang Haifeng.

2001
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,560
So fast.

2002
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,480
General, please go to the treasure tent.

2003
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,360
When they talk, they will walk together.

2004
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,840
Marshal Yang said it was exhausting.

2005
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,440
How long do you want to memorize

2006
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,440
How long will you memorize them?

2007
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,560
I can't memorize it.

2008
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,760
Wipe out the smoke signal and send the good news.

2009
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,360
I'm going back to Bianjing.

2010
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,760
The young phoenix didn't let his life down.

2011
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,800
A heroine has a good reputation.

2012
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,160
Thank you for your applause.

2013
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,640
Yes.

2014
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,360
That was a fast cut.

2015
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,080
The actors are doing their best.

2016
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,680
Yeah.

2017
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,240
It's hard.

2018
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,920
Let him rest in peace.

2019
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,840
To him.

2020
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,720
This game...

2021
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,840
Don't do this.

2022
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,240
That's called rest.

2023
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,360
Go down and rest.

2024
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,760
Change us up this time.

2025
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,920
and continue to perform.

2026
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,640
Say more.

2027
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,720
Let me introduce the teacher next to you.

2028
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,440
His surname is Shi.

2029
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,840
His name is Shi Jinxiang.

2030
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,320
It's true that Mr Shi

2031
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,600
looks younger in his thirties.

2032
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,000
There's a word for him.

2033
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,360
A specific word.

2034
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Baby face.

2035
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,760
Raise your hand if you know about crosstalk.

2036
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,800
Learn humor.

2037
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,720
Look.

2038
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,200
You're right.

2039
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Take off your shoes.

2040
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,200
Come on, stand up.

2041
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,040
I'll reward you later.

2042
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,840
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

2043
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,360
Come on, bro.

2044
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,440
Go kowtow to him.

2045
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,920
My old father.

2046
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,160
Okay.

2047
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,160
Good crosstalk. Interesting.

2048
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,920
I did watch some crosstalk

2049
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,520
some crosstalk.

2050
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,000
I think I like

2051
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,920
this kind of performance.

2052
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,040
Like crosstalk and talk show.

2053
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
I like it very much.

2054
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,520
I think crosstalk

2055
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,680
He's very fast at answering.

2056
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,560
His exaggerated performance

2057
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,760
or some classic jokes.

2058
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,520
make us feel

2059
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,040
they have great skills.

2060
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,680
We need to learn a lot.

2061
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,320
Thank you again

2062
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,080
for your wonderful performance.

2063
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,840
Let's add a small show.

2064
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,000
Anyone

2065
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,680
wants to perform on stage?

2066
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,840
Here.

2067
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,160
It's shocking.

2068
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,080
Here.

2069
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,480
Let's welcome this handsome man.

2070
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,800
What are you doing?

2071
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,080
What's going on?

2072
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,240
I wrote a story.

2073
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:19,840
What is he doing?

2074
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,840
I had

2075
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,120
I had 100,000 thoughts.

2076
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,320
Because we held hands the day before.

2077
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,440
I expressed my feelings openly.

2078
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,960
Nothing bad will happen.

2079
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,320
My legs are shaking.

2080
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,160
Don't be afraid.

2081
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,000
Yinbo, I'm here.

2082
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,600
Do you know me?

2083
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,040
This is a flying dragon in the sky.

2084
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:40,800
Okay, this one.

2085

2087
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,160
Like a foreign royal family.

I think this matter

2097
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:56,960
Well,

2098
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,320

2099
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,840
very detailed things.

2100
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,800
Maybe

2101
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,000
if you want to pursue a girl,

2102
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,480
you should pay more attention

2103
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,560
her preferences.

2104
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,520
or

2105
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,800
something she doesn't like.

2106
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,920
This is a trick.

2107
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,280
and a shortcut.

2108
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,400
Just remember these things.

2109
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,400
can make you

2110
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,040
in her heart,

2111
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,320

Remember to say something nice to girls.

sweet words

2115
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,160

2117
