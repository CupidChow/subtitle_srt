1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Tata hasn't seen the real me.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,000
I saw it.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,080
(I fell in love with him.)

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,040
What happens now

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,480
will make your final choice change.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,600
Nothing will change.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,040
I've been chasing him for so many days.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
Just one or two days.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,720
Even if she likes someone else,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,880
I have to get her back.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,320
She's in danger when she first sees Tae-seo.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
The soup...

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,920
I'll give it back to you

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,080
I'll give it back to you.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,480
But I never thought Terri was naive.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,000
I've always thought he's very shrewd.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,840
I have to confess my love no matter what.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,560
We're already like this.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,200
I'll let her down if I don't confess.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
I'm sorry to myself.

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,560
Xiao Ling said you have 80 percent of the soup.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,200
Cry.

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
Listen to her.

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,040
Xinxin told me I got 60 percent.

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,120
Let me tell you, I have 10%.

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
I also say 60 or 40.

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,640
What about you?

28
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,760
10,000 percent of love.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,240
Love Siblings

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,920
Let love double.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Welcome to

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,160
brothers intervene in dating

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,039
healing and warm variety show.

34
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,200
Love Sisters.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,280
Let's welcome

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
We're going to

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,240
of this episode.

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
Xinxin.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,520
Hello.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,640
I love you.

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,320
I'm coming.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,040
Do you know what Xin gave me?

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
She slapped you.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,759
Xin gave me candles

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
and wrote me a note.

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,600
and made me coffee.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
You didn't, did you?

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,079
Okay.

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
A scented candle.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,200
Fatty.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm going to steal your sister.

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
What?

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,560
This...

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
What is it?

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,280
You want to steal my sister?

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Yes.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,440
It's yours.

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
Am I that worthless?

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
(To members of the house.)

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,000
(Confession is coming.)

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
For boys and girls

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
for boys and girls.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Please discuss and make your choice.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
It's a romantic dinner.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,880
B is for barbecue.

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
Then you go to the soup.

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,480
Okay.

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,160
If the boy is gone,

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
You still want to play five-piece chess with me?

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
Haven't you lost enough?

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
You can ask again, right?

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes, I wasn't angry yesterday.

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
You can make requests.

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,200
What is it?

75
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,240
Nothing.

76
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,760
You can lose.

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Not really.

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
I don't want to be mad at him.

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
It's okay. I can be a screensaver.

80
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,079
What kind of person is that?

81
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,680
What a bad person.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,280
I thought that

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
I never thought it would happen to me.

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Tata hasn't seen the real me.

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
I saw it.

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
I saw it.

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,000
It's scary.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Tata, no.

89
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
Fall in love directly.

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
If you say that,

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,360
Come on.

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,280
You haven't lost yet.

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
I didn't lose.

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,680
Yes.

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
The other side is blocked.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,360
He's going to win.

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
I blocked him.

98
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,519
What are these three? Are they ghosts?

99
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,320
Stop it.

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,760
No.

101
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,560
Here, one, two, three.

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,600
Tata, you do it.

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
I think you're smarter than me.

104
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
You owe me three more requests.

105
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,880
No.

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm smart when I'm just a bystander.

107
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,320
I sit here alone.

108
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,159
I can't see anything.

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
If you lose, make a request.

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Don't accept Harry's confession.

111
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay.

112
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm so bad.

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,640
I'm connected to you.

114
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,200
Are you playing with your sister?

115
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm sorry I'm so bad.

116
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,159
Where's Harry?

117
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,520
Why isn't Harry here?

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Harry just killed me.

119
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Harry is getting impatient.

120
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,080
The Harry bag is getting impatient.

121
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Just...

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Where's Harry?

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Where is he?

124
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,520
No one helps me.

125
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
I'll help you.

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,160
Okay.

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,600
You didn't. Help Tae-ri.

128
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,880
His request...

129
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I think I can help him.

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Why did you play so many more pieces than me?

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,480
Didn't I play first?

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,040
I did it first.

133
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,200
Yes, you go next.

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Mine can go down many places.

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
Why only this one?

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,480
I think I'm going to lose.

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,880
You won't lose.

138
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,440
It's over.

139
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
The Divine One.

140
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Block.

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
Okay, don't accept it.

142
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,400
Sit.

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
What about the beef jerky?

144
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
I didn't see it either.

145
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Where is it?

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
I just took it upstairs.

147
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
It suddenly occurred to me

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,080
Why did you buy it again?

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,320
I thought it was gone.

150
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
So I bought two packs.

151
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,120
You haven't eaten your beef jerky.

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
It's spicy.

153
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
But it's so dry.

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Take it back.

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,920
to cook a dish for your New Year's Eve dinner.

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
One dish.

157
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,640
And milk tea.

158
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
It tastes different.

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,840
Yes, I'll buy two.

160
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,880
You guys drink.

161
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,080
We almost ate a pack.

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,960
Did he say that two are cheaper?

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
The same.

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,440
He lied to you.
Guolifang.

165
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,920
He lied to you.

166
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,280
He lied to you.

167
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Two bags will make it 20 yuan cheaper.

168
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
That's too much.

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
The original price I gave you.

170
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Do you want hot or cold?

171
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Anything.

172
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm not picky.

173
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
I'll drink whatever Bobo gives me.

174
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
You should lose some weight.

175
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,080
That's too much.

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Really?

177
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Did you buy two bags cheap before?

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
Yes, two bags are cheaper than 20 bags.

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm so mad.

180
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
You got cut, right?

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
It's a trap.

182
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
Add his contact information.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
he won't return the money to me.

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Guolifang,

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,320
Right?

186
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,440
Guolifang.

187
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,640
Boss,

188
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,760
You lost my trust.

189
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
You can only buy it next time.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,640
and buy two more bags.

191
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
and give him a discount of 40 yuan.

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,120
40.

193
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,280
That's the only way.

194
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,120
Let him return it to you. In your dreams.

195
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,360
Eat up, Harry.

196
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,480
What time did he go out?

197
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,920
It's already four.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Why? Do you want to leave me?

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
No.

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
You can leave soon.

201
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
Tae-seo.

202
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,320
Coming.

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,920
Let's go

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,280
Let's go.

205
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
A sincere game.

206
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
is about sincerity.

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm the most sincere in the car.

208
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,960
Where do you put me?

209
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
If I'm not sincere,

210
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,880
no one in the world is sincere.

211
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
This is not bad.

212
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,880
Barbecue

213
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm hungry.

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,800
Okay.

215
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,160
It's burning.

216
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
Soon.

217
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Xinjiang lamb skewers.

218
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
I'll do it.

219
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,160
Go inside.

220
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,480
I like barbecue. Let me do it here.

221
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
You two stay here for a while.

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,840
I'll accompany you later.

223
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,840
What do you think?

224
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Good.

225
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,320
The former opponents are having barbecue together.

226
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
A very warm scene.

227
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,560
A picture.

228
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Bring the pepper noodles in.

229
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,440
Add it if it's not spicy enough.

230
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,160
Okay.

231
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,720
Have some first.

232
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,520
Bring them here. There are still a few left.

233
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Baba

234
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
It's comfortable.

235
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,280
Let's eat.

236
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,400
and start the blind box.

237
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,160
Give sharp questions to the sharp ones.

238
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Ask some easy questions.

239
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
That's it.

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Let's talk about your first impression.

241
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
and the first impression of you.

242
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,840
Who starts first?

243
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
You first.

244
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Okay.

245
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll talk first.

246
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll go first.

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
It's dangerous to see Tae-seo at first sight.

248
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,120
He's like an actor who acts like a bossy boss.

249
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
Are you sure you want to say it now?

250
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't see it.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Fair competition.

252
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,480
The ping pong paddle is ready.

253
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,280
The first impression of Fatty

254
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
It's funny.

255
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
and relaxed.

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,640
You can do everything.

257
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Fatty.

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,560
What?

259
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,080
Fatty.

260
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
The fat we understand?

261
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,880
Yes.

262
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,280
Okay.

263
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,240
Maybe I'm fat.

264
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,200
I want to be called Fatty when I come in.

265
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,360
When you go out, it's called slim.

266
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,320
I think he's reliable.

267
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,480
The first impression of the picture is sunny

268
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
It's very energetic.

269
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,760
It can bring vitality to everyone.

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
Hello.

271
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,080
Hello.

272
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,600
E.

273
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
What are you?

274
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,400
I don't know.

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,680
you like Yangtao.

276
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,000
No, I like mushrooms.

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,840
You, he is...

278
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,120
He's a mushroom woman.

279
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,400
My first impression of Harry

280
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,120
It's funny

281
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
He just said to go upstairs to check the room

282
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,880
The northeast dialect came out

283
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,240
Harry doesn't have much pride anyway.

284
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
It's easy to make friends.

285
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm fine with anything.

286
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,720
You choose.

287
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,160
Me too.

288
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
Then you can.

289
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,560
I'll sleep here.

290
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,520
Okay, you sleep outside.

291
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,680
Are you busy recently?

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,840
Will you go out often?

293
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
I think I will.

294
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,240
Can you speak English?

295
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,080
You can.

296
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
I will.

297
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,600
So your English

298
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,120
My English is pretty good.

299
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
Not bad.

300
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,280
You have a strong northeast smell.

301
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Yes, I have a strong northeast flavor.

302
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,800
I'll speak English.

303
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
It doesn't taste like northeast food.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,680
Indeed.

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
This is my first impression.

306
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
That's all.

307
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,400
The first impression of Fatty was

308
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
Because in the car,

309
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
the four of us went for dinner.

310
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
I really thought

311
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,080
Although the word is not good,

312
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
I feel like you're digging a hole for me.

313
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Why?

314
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
The four of you

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,280
were attacking me.

316
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,120
They kept digging a hole for me.

317
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,520
Then I was silly.

318
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
I said whatever you asked.

319
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Military training.

320
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,160
It was "military training".

321
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,360
I think at that time,

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,560
But after we got to know each other,

323
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,960
Good.

324
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Because I learned to be smart later.

325
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,480
I can't dig a hole.

326
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,360
The map

327
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,000
Because it was introduced later.

328
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
When Tu came back that night,

329
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
I found that he kept talking.

330
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,240
I mean,

331
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
If I were you,

332
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,120
I would never

333
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,080
I won't

334
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
I'm still so energetic.

335
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,520
Hurry up.

336
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
Tu, come here.

337
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,680
Hello.

338
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,400
Map, you can go up later.

339
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,360
You'll be surprised.

340
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
Really?

341
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Hello

342
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,040
We have two new friends.

343
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,920
Hello.

344
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
As for Harry,

345
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
the first person I met

346
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,000
was Harry.

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,560
Your name is Harry.

348
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
I said my name is Tae-ri.

349
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,360
Hello.

350
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
Hello, I'm Tae-seo.

351
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,440
Harry, what's your smile?

352
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
No.

353
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,720
Although our names are similar, I think...

354
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
My first impression was me.

355
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,240
Maybe I'll get along with you

356
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,000
I might get along with you more.

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
And the soup...

358
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll give it back to you

359
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll give it back to you.

360
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,160
Watch out!

361
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,920
Here.

362
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,600
Let me talk about the soup.

363
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,040
The first impression is that this boy is handsome.

364
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,880
And I think soup is

365
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
At first,

366
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
his image

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,400
with you.

368
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,920
Later I found

369
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,800
he's actually very thoughtful.

370
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
Harry...

371
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,520
I thought it was childish at first sight.

372
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
At first, I thought the most childish

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
is Harry.

374
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,760
I saw him

375
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,600
from boy to man.

376
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,120
If it's a map,

377
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
I think it's E.

378
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Both of us are E.

379
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,120
So I think

380
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,920
gave me

381
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
in the beginning.

382
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
It's still the same

383
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,720
As roommates,

384
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
until now,

385
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,600
I often tease him.

386
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,680
From the moment I told him to be his brother-in-law,

387
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Then I said I couldn't be your brother-in-law

388
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,080
Then be your brother.

389
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,440
I'm tired.

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
I can only be your cousin.

391
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,240
I think

392
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
to be swayed.

393
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,000
If you love him, you'll love him. Let's go.

394
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,120
I told you.

395
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm paying you back.

396
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,720
The return is the return.

397
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
You can't love boldly

398
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,120
or love boldly.

399
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,840
I said it's okay.

400
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,920
It won't

401
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,360
affect our relationship.

402
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
Tarri

403
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
A mature man.

404
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,680
To be honest,

405
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,160
you can face me

406
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,040
you can still face me.

407
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,320
I think I have respected

408
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
but also

409
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,280
the tolerance of a man.

410
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,040
In real life,

411
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
in real life,

412
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,160
when you see a competitor.

413
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
You want him to get off.

414
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,360
It's rare to be like this.

415
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,920
Let's talk about the soup first.

416
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,520
The first time I saw him, I said,

417
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,560
Isn't this a joke?

418
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,200
They look like brothers.

419
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,800
I laughed.

420
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,760
I held back my laughter for a long time.

421
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
I'm Xiaoling.

422
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,960
Soup.

423
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
Soup. Okay.

424
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,880
Okay.

425
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,840
Then I thought he was handsome.

426
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,760
Especially when

427
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,560
when he started introducing himself,

428
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,400
I thought he was

429
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,960
shining.

430
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm a ping-pong player

431
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,640
in the United States.

432
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
Table Tennis.

433
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,920
This is

434
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
my qualification to Tsinghua University.

435
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
And Harry,

436
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,560
From the beginning,

437
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,640
I thought it was the same.

438
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
I think he's funny.

439
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,800
But actually,

440
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,320
after more contact,

441
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,800
I think

442
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,920
although he's a little younger than me,

443
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,320
I think he's more mature

444
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,960
more mature than me.

445
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,400
If you're fat,

446
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
I thought

447
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
A big guest.

448
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,520
Hey.

449
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,200
I must have some hidden skills.

450
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,640
As expected,

451
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,200
for so long

452
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,160
to be roommates.

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,839
There are three of them

454
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,359
We are two.

455
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,520
Sometimes,

456
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,200
more things

457
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,160
Be it secretly

458
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,599
or openly,

459
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,720
or openly.

460
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,120
Although it may be a pity,

461
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,920
but I think being yourself

462
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,480
and be happy.

463
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
And Tarri.

464
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,200
Terri, actually I really...

465
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
I thought

466
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
you're a "scumbag" at first sight, you know?

467
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,600
You are...

468
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Why did I

469
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,920
at the beginning, right?

470
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Why didn't you say the soup?

471
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,040
He looks honest.

472
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,800
Am I not honest?

473
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,920
I don't know the back.

474
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,840
You look quite honest.

475
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
At first,

476
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
I might feel

477
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,760
an expert in love, right?

478
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,360
And

479
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,920
I was a little cautious at first.

480
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
But I think

481
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,880
I think

482
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,440
he is a reliable

483
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
who thinks a lot

484
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
and considerate.

485
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,640
It's your turn.

486
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,840
Let me think about it.

487
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,760
Let's start with Tae-seo.

488
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,040
When I saw Tae-seo,

489
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,280
He looks handsome.

490
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,440
But from the bottom of my heart,

491
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,920
I think

492
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,200
although you are

493
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,040
an E,

494
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,120
But I can understand that he is slow to warm up.

495
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,160
Whether it's about friendship

496
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,840
or in love,

497
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,960
in love,

498
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
and boring.

499
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,760
But I never thought Terri was naive.

500
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
I've always thought he's very shrewd.

501
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,960
Really.

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,520
I always think

503
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
a very shrewd person.

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,000
including playing games and playing cards.

505
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
I found

506
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,480
a calculator

507
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
You know what?

508
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,080
And if you look fat,

509
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
At first,

510
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,920
I thought he was very funny.

511
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
But it's okay for you to joke later.

512
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
But I found that when you were joking,

513
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
when you joke.

514
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,760
Actually, people like me

515
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,480
I can't control it when I'm joking.

516
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
In the beginning,

517
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
the label directly.

518
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,240
Nothing else

519
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,440
"Happy Puppy".

520
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,080
is enough to prove

521
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,320
who can bring joy to people around him.

522
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,280
And soup.

523
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,200
The soup...

524
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
When I looked at him,

525
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,840
I think

526
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,400
Really.

527
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,600
The one who stabbed me.

528
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,320
Backstabbing.

529
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,360
It belongs to

530
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,240
He asked me

531
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,000
Where are you from?

532
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,720
I told him where I came from.

533
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,360
You told him?

534
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,000
I told him.

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,160
Then I asked him where you are from.

536
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,080
I won't tell you.

537
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,240
I can't tell you.

538
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,440
I can't.

539
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,920
I'll tell you everything.

540
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,560
but you didn't tell me.

541
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
But later I think

542
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,240
because

543
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,680
are roommates.

544
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,240
Every night

545
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,800
We basically chat

546
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,840
We chat in the middle of the night

547
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
Although he's slow to warm up,

548
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,000
he's really not the same person

549
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,280
are not the same person.

550
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,440
Two faces.

551
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,520
Don't judge others.

552
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,720
I think so too.

553
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
He's too calculating.

554
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,120
Two faces

555
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,240
Sometimes people like me

556
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
I can't control it when I'm joking.

557
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,600
I mean it.

558
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,680
Because I think the experience of soup

559
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,560
is similar to mine.

560
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,400
To be honest,

561
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
Including studying abroad.

562
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
We can speak English sometimes.

563
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,440
and narrow-minded.

564
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,600
We are really

565
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,360
narrow-minded.

566
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,280
in a relationship like a pupil.

567
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,520
We are quite alike.

568
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
Sometimes in love,

569
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,040
Fatty, come on.

570
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,000
Let me ask you a question.

571
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,600
It suits me so well.

572
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I just want to ask you a question.

573
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,080
What happens now

574
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,520
will make your final choice change.

575
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,400
No matter what happens,

576
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,200
I will

577
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,680
follow my heart.

578
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,680
Like now.

579
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,040
If I have to think about what will happen,

580
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,680
can change my mind,

581
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,000
we need to talk about our relationship.

582
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,240
If we talk about our relationship,

583
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
and find that we don't get along,

584
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
it might make me flinch.

585
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,840
But the final direction won't change.

586
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,640
To put it bluntly, there are several chances like this.

587
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,400
I have to confess no matter what.

588
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,120
We're already like this.

589
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,760
I'll let her down if I don't confess.

590
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm sorry to myself.

591
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,920
Actually, I wanted to say

592
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
if she

593
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,960
has feelings for someone else,

594
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,840
If you like someone,

595
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,560
I might change.

596
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
But then I thought,

597
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,880
nothing would change.

598
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
I've been chasing her for so many days.

599
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,160
Just one or two days.

600
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Even if she likes someone else,

601
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
I have to get her back.

602
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,200
Okay.

603
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Good.

604
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,800
My feelings for me

605
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,760
Actually,

606
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,480
my own rhythm.

607
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
I think

608
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
I won't say it's because of something.

609
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
Unless it's a matter of principle,

610
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,960
write a letter.

611
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
You follow your rhythm.

612
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,520
As long as nothing happens to her,

613
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,280
you won't change.

614
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,800
Yes.

615
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
No matter what happens to me now, nothing will change.

616
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,640
I won't change even if I receive the letter.

617
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,120
Okay.

618
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,760
Let's go back.

619
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
Let's go back to the house.

620
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,080
Let's go home.

621
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,120
It's cold.

622
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,080
Are they back?

623
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,280
I don't think so.

624
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,040
Are they back?

625
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
Do you want to sit in the lobby and ask questions?

626
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,200
Then tell me

627
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,880
and your lover?

628
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,720
What about you?

629
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,160
I replied 50, 50.

630
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,720
You're a human.

631
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,800
I replied 50 and 50.

632
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,640
I said if there was love,

633
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,120
Fifty. Fifty.

634
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,520
She's not 50.

635
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,320
Yes.

636
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
How could I be 50?

637
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,240
60.

638
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Who is 60?

639
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,080
It must be Fatty.

640
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,400
Listen to her.

641
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm lucky when I'm in love.

642
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,880
You pay 60 yuan.

643
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,920
I also say 60, 40.

644
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,600
What about you?

645
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,880
10,000 percent of love.

646
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,880
He is...

647
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,400
No.

648
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,040
Listen to me.

649
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,560
10,000 love is too much.

650
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,960
Tae-seo said it first.

651
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
Tae-seo said it first, then I said it.

652
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,120
How much did Tae-seo say?

653
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,160
100% love.

654
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,000
You're also in love.

655
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,840
I didn't say that.

656
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
You said 10,000 percent first.

657
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,640
I didn't.

658
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,480
How much did he say?

659
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
He said 10,000 percent.

660
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,080
Really?

661
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,840
Yes.

662
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,320
Tae-seo said 100 percent.

663
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,760
No.

664
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,640
I always say that when my sister is here.

665
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,080
It's okay. You guys continue.

666
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,440
The soup and the map are 60.

667
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
60 soup.

668
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,240
Xiao Ling is 80.

669
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,800
Xiao Ling said you have 80 percent of the soup.

670
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,160
Cry.

671
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,080
She said 80 percent

672
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
Listen to her.

673
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
Xinxin told me I got 60 percent.

674
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,360
Let me tell you, I have 10%.

675
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,920
You have it, Fatty.

676
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,000
Open your transfer and let me see.

677
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,040
Once I start dating her,

678
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,560
she won't answer my calls.

679
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,520
What are you doing?

680
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,960
She didn't even tell me about her trip.

681
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,240
Yes.

682
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,000
Then I asked her where you were.

683
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,520
No.

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,120
No way. I'm not like that.

685
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,200
She only shows up

686
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,600
I may appear to ten percent.

687
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
It's normal not to say it.

688
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,920
Why did you say it?

689
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,760
You love to get involved.

690
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
too much.

691
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,160
Sometimes,

692
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,960
I don't even know that people like me.

693
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
And that person disappeared.

694
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,360
That's better.

695
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
I want to know why.

696
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
Where did he go?

697
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,680
You're really 60. Trust me.

698
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,280
I have 60.

699
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,080
I'll give you 50.

700
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,280
I think it's fair.

701
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,000
You gave me 50.

702
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,360
Yes.

703
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,840
Better than 10,000.

704
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm going to tell on you anyway.

705
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
Be careful.

706
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,520
Don't be afraid.

707
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
You'll be scolded tomorrow.

708
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,240
Don't be afraid.

709
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Xiao Ling drank two bottles of fruit cubes.

710
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,440
Really?

711
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,560
Really

712
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,080
Really?

713
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,160
Yes.

714
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,120
What do you not know?

715
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,560
I don't know.

716
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,760
Tu wants to date me

717
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,320
because he was rejected by Tata's brother.

718
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,640
I was rejected, you know?

719
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
It's normal for you to be rejected.

720
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
It's strange that Xiaoling was rejected.

721
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,920
It's not strange that I was rejected.

722
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,720
He rejected me.

723
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,360
But to be honest,

724
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,760
the topic of the soup

725
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,200
didn't crack my question.

726
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Can't we sit down and talk?

727
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,600
Why do we have to talk standing?

728
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,760
Let's go down and talk.

729
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,080
Do you know

730
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,960
where we went today?

731
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
A duck. A duck.

732
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,040
It's where you first met me.

733
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Only you have been there.

734
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,640
So it's no fun.

735
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,920
Just make some soup

736
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,880
I've made it for you.

737
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,600
Let me tell you.

738
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,360
Luckily you didn't go.

739
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,480
You won't be able to stand it.

740
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
And we have to wear a bathrobe and step into the water.

741
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,240
You look wet and heavy.

742
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,200
When you go down wearing something

743
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
Short sleeves and shorts

744
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,880
Five men in the water really

745
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,360
I don't dare to watch this scene.

746
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,760
You know?

747
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,000
Chi-zi, if you say it bigger,

748
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,520
we'll pass.

749
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
Chi-zi.

750
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,280
I told you there would be no water

751
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,160
there will be no water.

752
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,600
Fatty will lose the water after entering the pool.

753
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
You're so bad.

754
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
The pool of drought.

755
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
It's drought, right?

756
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,280
No.

757
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,320
The water went up to a water level.

758
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,640
I was wondering what to do with the water.

759
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,280
You don't understand.

760
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm stuck in the middle.

761
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm stuck between Tarri and Chubs.

762
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,560
by Tae-seo and Chubby.

763
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,160
You're happy.

764
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,640
When I turn around, you "little diamond".

765
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,160
When I turn around,

766
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,760
two "little diamonds" are looking at me.

767
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,360
Let's go. I'm going to take out the trash.

768
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,360
Okay.

769
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,920
Happy time is over.

770
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
The map and Harry

771
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,480
Their answers

772
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,360
are very different.

773
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,160
And Tu went to your interview.

774
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
He doesn't have any feelings for me.

775
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,360
What do you mean?

776
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,960
You know what?

777
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,200
Xiao Ling looks different.

778
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,040
No.

779
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,560
In the last two days,

780
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
will I still assist my brothers?

781
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
I don't need help.

782
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
Look at herself.

783
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,080
Yes.

784
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,760
I think no matter what the result is,

785
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,080
I still support her.

786
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I've learned about Xinxin.

787
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes.

788
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,920
Because Xinxin had contact with Harry at first.

789
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,920
I said Xinxin and Harry look good together.

790
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,280
Do you remember?

791
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,360
I didn't hear it.

792
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,440
I heard it.

793
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,760
And the soup fell in love with you at first sight.

794
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
He said he would confess to you.

795
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,880
He said he wanted to do something.

796
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,600
but it's a bit difficult.

797
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,160
He can't do it.

798
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,640
I said you should see.

799
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,600
What is it?

800
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,800
I'm not telling you.

801
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,000
Do you think you're sincere to Xiaoling?

802
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,960
I think I'm sincere.

803
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,080
From the first day

804
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,560
the day we texted each other,

805
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,960
we started to contact.

806
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,920
And we play together.

807
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,440
and travel later.

808
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,320
are very sincere.

809
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,040
I think you can say whatever you want.

810
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,000
To be honest,

811
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
my relationship with Tae-seo

812
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
is a competition.

813
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800
But when we were together,

814
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't think

815
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,560
towards me.

816
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,280
It won't affect us.

817
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,800
between us.

818
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
I think so too.

819
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,720
You know?

820
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
Chi-zi, if you say it bigger,

821
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,360
we'll pass.

822
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,200
Chi-zi

823
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,760
I'm so full.

824
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,200
When you go down,

825
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,120
there'll be no water.

826
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,080
I knew it.

827
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
you'll pay 60 yuan.

828
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,480
Actually,

829
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,760
I can't make any decision for you.

830
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,640
But in my opinion,

831
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,680
he doesn't deserve your love.

832
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
Do you want to go, Xiaoling?

833
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
Whether I have the chance or not,

834
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
I'll talk to him.

835
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
Here.

836
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,920
Actually, I've edited it.

837
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
Me too.

838
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,560
I've already edited it.

839
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
I don't think it will be for a while.

840
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,920
I think I will.

841
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,080
Then you have to feel that it's been a long time.

842
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,480
Two or three months.

843
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,200
Tata and I are the same.

844
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,960
We need to meet.

845
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
The key is that I don't feel secure.

846
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,160
It's not that I don't feel insecure.

847
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
I don't feel

848
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,440
we won't be that close.

849
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,880
Next week,

850
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
our little house

851
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,680
is coming to an end.

852
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,040
We're brothers.

853
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,880
Will you give us your final vote?

854
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,040
Will you receive

855
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,960
(will you be able to)

856
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,720
your true love.

857
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,360
Let's look forward to the next episode.

858
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,240
Let's sing "Love Sisters".

859
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
Let love double

860
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
The night before the confession

861
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,880
In order to

862
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,640
confirm each other's feelings better.

863
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,120
Next, we will ask her

864
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,880
I'll ask him a question instead of my brother.

865
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll tell you when the court is here.

866
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
If someone else

867
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,360
does everything to you,

868
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,720
you will still like him, right?

869
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,160
What a sharp question.

870
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Are both parties equal in love?

871
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,840
You scared me.

872
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,560
After getting in touch with Tata,

873
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,320
what did you regret

874
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,600
what you regret in the house?

875
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,920
Do you mind being a match?

876
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,080
Since you're not sure about your feelings,

877
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,160
you've been

878
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,480
giving the signal to Xiaoling.

879
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,360
Are you looking for a way out for yourself?

880
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
You look like a face.

881
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,000
If Tae-seo had been in the house from the beginning,

882
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,960
would you choose Tae-seo more firmly?

883
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,240
I want to express my feelings

884
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
my feelings.

885
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,160
If he likes me,

886
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
he'll confess to me.

887
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,920
I know

888
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,080
my feelings.

889
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,000
I think he'll confess to me.

890
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,840
I don't think anyone will.

891
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000
Tell them

892
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,800
your true thoughts.

893
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,360
I didn't do anything.

894
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,600
There must be some regrets.

895
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,200
I still need to convey my thoughts.

896
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,120
Because I like this girl very much.

897
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,640
I want to fight for her.

898
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
for such a long time.

899
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,840
Don't let this relationship down.

900
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,280
