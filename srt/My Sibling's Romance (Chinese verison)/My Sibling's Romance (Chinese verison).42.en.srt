1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,320
Do you know her well? Yes.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,040
Yes.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Do you know me well?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
You've been cold to me for a long time because of someone.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
A man or a woman?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,920
A man.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,360
What's wrong?

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,960
Nothing.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,480
What's wrong?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,560
Tell me.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,280
Say it.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm so annoyed.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,800
Love Siblings

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,880
Double love!

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,560
intervention in love.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
and social therapy.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,240
Love Sisters.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,000
We are

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
a family member.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,360
We're going to

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,000
the update of this episode.

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,560
Should we put them together?

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
I was thinking about this just now.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,080
So big.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
It's folded.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,080
Doesn't it have to be fixed?

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Look, there's a line here.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
It can be put on.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
Put this in

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,320
Like this

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,960
Yes.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
Let's go.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,039
I've never done this kind of labor.

34
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,280
Nothing.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
Just put it here.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
How are you going to move out when you're done packing?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
Like this.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,640
Very light

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
The door is big.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
Let's study it first.

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
I don't understand.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,800
It's quite abstract.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,240
No.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,840
This is badminton.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Why is it so long?

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,760
This should be horizontally.

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Right.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,200
hang that net.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Maybe.

50
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,600
I see.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,640
Why don't we pretend outside?

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
You're really...

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
We can take it out later.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,760
It's too cold outside.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,880
How can I get it out?

56
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,240
Put it on this.

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
This is up there.

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
It's easy to put it away.

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Idiot.

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,079
What?

61
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,760
Nothing.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,560
It should be like this.

63
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,360
Pull it like this.

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
Really

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,640
Seriously.

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,280
What's wrong?

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
It should be like this.

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
And like this.

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Okay.

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
But can you pull it out?

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
I can't pull it.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,440
Don't touch your hand.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,920
No.

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
It's hot.

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,480
It's a straight amount of exercise.

76
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,760
Right?

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Yes.

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,079
No.

79
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,200
I haven't started yet.

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
I laughed.

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,200
Is that badminton?

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,240
Wait.

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
I'll go first.

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Wait.

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
I didn't move.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
You didn't put it in.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
I did.

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,520
You didn't.

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Why didn't I put it in?

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,400
It's not in here.

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,960
It's in.

92
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,680
No.

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll definitely put it in.

94
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,160
You didn't.

95
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,600
I definitely did.

96
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,920
I don't think it's firm.

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,080
Is it my imagination?

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
Why is the net so low?

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,400
It's upside down.

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,440
Look down.

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Right?

102
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
I can't do it now.

103
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,160
Should I put it through?

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Like this.

105
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Hold it here.

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Come here and hold it.

107
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,320
Can you fight?

108
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,840
It's windy outside

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,560
Yes

110
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,640
It's fine if it's rubber ball

111
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
This is badminton

112
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,960
Like this.

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Almost.

114
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,520
Let go.

115
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Almost.

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Let me feel the wind.

117
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,960
Can we get out?

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
I have to fold the one below.

119
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Smart.

120
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Thank you.

121
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Is this your first day?

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's move out first.

123
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Fight or not.

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Move it out.

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,240
Really?

126
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
We're too fast.

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,640
Isn't this...

128
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
There's a badminton court here.

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,240
No.

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
The wind won't work.

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
The wind can't.

132
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,280
What is this?

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Dog.

134
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,560
Yes.

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,880
You said I look like a dog.

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,840
So I bought you a dog.

137
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,320
You don't know this kind of thing.

138
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Really?

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,040
I don't know.

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
In fact, Harry

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
in this date.

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,320
he cares about the sense of ritual.

143
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
You have.

144
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,960
make you feel

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,520
a sense of ritual.

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Can you share with us?

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
When I was in a relationship,

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,200
his work relationship

149
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,720
We often separate from each other.

150
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,600
So I made him

151
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,320
a bear for him.

152
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
It can be recorded.

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
I told him

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,200
Don't be nervous.

155
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Don't be anxious.

156
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
Now is the best beginning.

157
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,680
Because every morning

158
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
send our son and daughter to kindergarten

159
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
to the kindergarten.

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,200
In fact,

161
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
in my mind.

162
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,040
I thought

163
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,280
how it feels to walk like this.

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Then that day, I got distracted.

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,240
I said

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,560
I really want to experience

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,800
how it feels to walk on it.

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
Mr. Zhou asked me

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,120
if you really want to leave.

170
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,000
I said no.

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm just saying.

172
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
He said I've heard it from you several times.

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,480
Come on.

174
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Let's do it today.

175
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,120
I said no.

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
I was on a plane that day.

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
He said it's better to pick another day.

178
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,280
Once you think about it so many times,

179
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,000
If I hear you,

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,720
let's go.

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,760
and walk there.

182
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Mr. Zhou will suddenly be quick-witted.

183
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,120
There is no such thing usually.

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
But he suddenly

185
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,280
he will respond to your expectations.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm not good at making a sense of ritual.

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
But

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
my husband seems to like

189
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,560
doing this kind of thing.

190
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,720
On Valentine's Day this year,

191
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,480
I was performing in New Zealand.

192
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,240
I didn't sleep well the night before yesterday.

193
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,960
When I woke up,

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I said OK.

195
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,200
My schedule today

196
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
with my parents

197
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
to a tower.

198
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
When we went to the tower,

199
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,280
Then my husband said

200
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
I went bungee jumping.

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
Then I'll say yes.

202
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,400
Because I think

203
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,960
if he sees him finish that,

204
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,280
it may take an hour.

205
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,640
My sleep time is compressed.

206
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,400
I was afraid I would affect my performance.

207
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
I waited there for a long time.

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
I was so sleepy.

209
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
I was down there.

210
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,440
He was on the backstage.

211
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,760
He's preparing nervously.

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
I was too tired

213
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,120
I sat there and slept.

214
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,840
and slept like this.

215
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
After he jumped down,

216
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,720
I found out

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,520
because it was Valentine's Day,

218
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,880
he wanted to jump from the sky

219
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,400
and bring me a rose.

220
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,880
That's great.

221
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,000
This is romantic.

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Yes.

223
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
But I was so sleepy.

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,680
I've been fighting with my sleepy mind.

225
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
I almost gave up.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,520
I just want to say

227
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,320
take a photo for him.

228
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm going to bed.

229
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
Did you take it out?

230
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,560
In the end, the sky was dangerous.

231
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,200
I didn't let him take it.

232
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,720
He didn't take the flowers out.

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
It's a waste

234
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
Running to the side again

235
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
from a small basket

236
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,680
from a small basket.

237
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
But my only problem at that time

238
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
I was really sleepy.

239
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
So I couldn't feel

240
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
that romance.

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Romance has to be perfect

242
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm not sleepy.

243
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,640
Yes.

244
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,680
Don't close your eyes.

245
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,880
Yes.

246
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,160
Let me say something about my mom.

247
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,240
Because my mom is a very ceremonious person.

248
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,960
I will be on the same wall

249
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,920
on the same wall

250
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,200
on a wall.

251
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
Every Chinese New Year,

252
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
I would take a selfie

253
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,320
take a selfie with mom.

254
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
I do this every year.

255
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,159
Put on the prettiest makeup

256
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,880
and wear red clothes.

257
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,080
and asked me to wear red.

258
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,640
We must leave a picture

259
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,760
in front of Fortune.

260
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,679
There are already many.

261
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
This is a good idea.

262
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
Yes.

263
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,640
Actually, you can be romantic with your family.

264
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes.

265
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,240
This is you.

266
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
I thought you don't have a dog.

267
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,720
Didn't I tell you

268
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,880
I picked up a stray dog.

269
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Say hello.

270
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
You said I don't have a dog.

271
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
It's over, bro.

272
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
Help me.

273
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,640
I don't want to grill you anymore.

274
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
Is that what you really think?

275
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
Yes.

276
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,960
You're so handsome.

277
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
Your move

278
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,040
I face my heart.

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,520
Because I was in that state.

280
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
But I don't regret it.

281
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,280
My hair is about to stand up.

282
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
Why?

283
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
When I cried yesterday,

284
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,560
my sister hugged me.

285
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,680
Hurry up and hug her.

286
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
I want to cry even more.

287
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll go get Susu.

288
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,120
Eat something.

289
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,400
Let's see if you're right.

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes.

291
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
The ice queen is crying.

292
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,000
Sing it.

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Let it be.

294
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
What's its name?

295
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Brother Bo.

296
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

297
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
Okay.

298
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,960
OK, Yinbo.

299
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Got it.

300
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,400
What is this?

301
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,960
A dog.

302
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Yes.

303
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,960
You said I look like a dog.

304
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
So I bought you a dog.

305
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,960
Can I sit here?

306
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
Let's go upstairs.

307
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,400
Fatty.

308
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,120
Take your

309
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
your camera, okay?

310
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,720
Fatty.

311
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's have a feast.

312
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Let's go.

313
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,400
Where are we going?

314
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Let's talk.

315
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
Good evening.

316
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
What did you buy?

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,080
I bought you a cake.

318
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,640
In the fridge.

319
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,520
Anything else?

320
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Where have you been?

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I bought you a cat play stick.

322
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,320
What's wrong?

323
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,040
You don't look happy.

324
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,160
What's wrong?

325
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,200
Nothing.

326
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,880
What's wrong?

327
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Nothing.

328
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,840
What's wrong?

329
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't know.

330
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,880
What's wrong?

331
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
What?

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
Tell me.

333
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,880
Tell me.

334
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,920
I don't know what you're doing.

335
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,680
What's wrong?

336
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,560
I don't know what's wrong with you.

337
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,520
If you don't tell me,

338
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,480
Why?

339
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
I don't know.

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
I was annoyed for no reason.

341
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,880
I don't know what happened to him.

342
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,800
When I came back, there was a cloud on his head.

343
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,120
It's raining.

344
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,280
I don't know why he's suddenly like this.

345
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
Because today,

346
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,960
I haven't seen him all day.

347
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
I don't know.

348
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,560
what made him

349
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,680
because of something.

350
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,480
What's wrong?

351
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
He went up.

352
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
Go up.

353
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
Why are there so many people?

354
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Come up.

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,920
What are you doing?

356
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,480
Nothing.

357
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,680
No.

358
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm really fine.

359
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,440
Are you really okay?

360
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
You haven't seen me for a day.

361
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Be happy.

362
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,400
When you see me,

363
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,600
I miss you so much today.

364
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,080
I bought a jigsaw puzzle.

365
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
A puzzle?

366
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,360
Are you doing it now?

367
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,080
Let's go.

368
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
So funny.

369
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,160
Which one do you want?

370
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
Which one do you think looks better?

371
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
I think...

372
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Is there anything you don't want?

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
Most people don't want anything.

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
I don't want it.

375
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,680
I want this.

376
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,000
That's what I thought.

377
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,280
I said the same thing.

378
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,600
Look at this.

379
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,280
None

380
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,440
This is for the balloon

381
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
Almost

382
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,120
We played it when we were young.

383
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,920
I was my brother on weekends when I was young.

384
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Don't hang out with me.

385
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
So scary.

386
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,680
What happened to your brother when he was young?

387
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,000
I said he always asked me

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
wake me up early to play this lego

389
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
Play lego

390
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Yes

391
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,760
And his magical baby.

392
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
He dubbed them.

393
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
So I think he's silly.

394
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
dubbing for the magical baby.

395
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,320
Yes.

396
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
It's still a little difficult.

397
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,720
Why do I feel

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
it's a little difficult.

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
To be honest,

400
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
It's a little difficult.

401
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,120
I think so too.

402
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,560
Look at me.

403
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
The color is too shattered.

404
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,360
Just put it on the side.

405
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,720
Once it's done,

406
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm even angrier.

407
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't be mad, okay?

408
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,080
Calm down.

409
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm in a hurry.

410
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,240
Don't worry.

411
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,520
He was in a bad mood.

412
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,720
so I wanted to put a picture together.

413
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,960
to distract his attention.

414
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,040
and I'll stay with him for a while.

415
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,600
Maybe he'll be happier.

416
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,800
You can put this out.

417
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,840
Which one do you want?

418
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I definitely want this.

419
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,160
Why?

420
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,080
I did it.

421
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
Why don't you want me to do it?

422
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,880
Isn't this a girl?

423
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
Isn't this a boy?

424
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Right?

425
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Then I'll take this.

426
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,680
You punched me yesterday.

427
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
I didn't get even with you.

428
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,520
Did it hurt?

429
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,200
It's okay.

430
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,360
It's so sudden.

431
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,200
All of a sudden?

432
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
I heard you kept staring at me.

433
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
And I didn't see it.

434
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
He stared at me for about four or five seconds.

435
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,200
he only gave me a punch.

436
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,040
So why?

437
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,000
What do you mean why?

438
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,760
Why did you punch me?

439
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Did you forget?

440
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't know.

441
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,160
That's my habit.

442
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,920
It's not a good habit.

443
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
I can only say

444
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,760
What?

445
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,320
You want to hit me?

446
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
Aren't you...

447
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,680
What's wrong? Nothing.

448
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,400
You can do it.

449
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,080
Yes.

450
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
I returned it without it.

451
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
So what's wrong?

452
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,520
Tell me.

453
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,400
I haven't seen you for a day.

454
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,560
So I was a little annoyed.

455
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,000
See?

456
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,320
Take it.

457
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,200
Exchange.

458
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,400
Good evening.

459
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,720
Welcome.

460
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
Three VIPs.

461
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Three.

462
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
Welcome to the cat.

463
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,080
Didn't you see it?

464
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,720
This is called "Map".

465
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,040
Where?

466
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
Where?

467
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,640
My cat is called drawing.

468
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
I also made a sign.

469
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
So sweet.

470
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Can I drink this?

471
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,120
You can drink it all.

472
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
I just made it.

473
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,280
Really?

474
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,480
Before you come,

475
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,000
Everyone.

476
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,480
Is this grape juice

477
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,720
I don't know

478
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,359
Not bad.

479
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,560
Come on.

480
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,520
The landlord starts the topic.

481
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,839
Do you know Xiao Ling well?

482
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes.

483
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,359
Really?

484
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,119
One look.

485
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,119
Do you know me well?

486
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes.

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,920
I heard Tu said

488
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,599
I know Xiao Ling.

489
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,640
My first reaction was

490
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
when did I

491
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,200
tell you

492
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,680
about me?

493
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Then I thought about it.

494
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,160
Indeed.

495
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,280
I seem to talk to Tu a lot every day.

496
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,200
The map really knows me best

497
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
is Tom,

498
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
who knows me the best.

499
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,800
And I think

500
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,280
good.

501
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
You're very considerate

502
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
or you care about me,

503
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,720
or you care about me?

504
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,520
I would be a little surprised and happy.

505
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,120
It's okay.

506
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,600
It's just a small one.

507
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,720
Hey.

508
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
You didn't tell him you saw him.

509
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,920
I won't tell him.

510
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,080
I think I'm a Scorpio.

511
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
I have a strong sense of revenge.

512
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,600
He's really...

513
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,320
Tse-woo Wang has a deep grudge.

514
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,960
Luckily, when I was young,

515
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
I didn't do anything to hurt him.

516
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Actually,

517
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
I remembered something later.

518
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
Have you forgotten when you were little?

519
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,600
You've been cold to me for a long time because of someone.

520
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Think about it.

521
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,360
Who did you do it for?

522
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
Because of whom?

523
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,320
A man or a woman?

524
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
A man.

525
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Because your sister said

526
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,520
She values love over friendship.

527
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,040
No.

528
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,600
It's not about dating.

529
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
It's not about dating.

530
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,320
Are you surprised?

531
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,880
Well...

532
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,600
Who is it?

533
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,320
Who?

534
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,000
My sister's son.

535
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,880
My sister has a son.

536
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,200
I treated him very well.

537
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
I went to see my nephew

538
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
I went to see my nephew.

539
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
I didn't see him.

540
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
You were old then.

541
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,760
Really.

542
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
I was really...

543
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,200
Were you disappointed?

544
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
I was really disappointed.

545
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
Why didn't you tell me?

546
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,240
I was in the pre-interview.

547
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,320
After the interview,

548
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,880
I remembered this.

549
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
Actually,

550
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,320
is very memorable to me.

551
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,920
in my heart.

552
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,640
in my mind.

553
00:18:59,640 --> 00:18:59,840
Yes.

554
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,320
I remember.

555
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,280
Because my sister had a nephew.

556
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,880
I have to give all my time to my nephew

557
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,480
I give all my time to my nephew.

558
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
including my Moments,

559
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
in my Moments,

560
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,480
in all the photos.

561
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,600
He's all my nephew.

562
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:10,800
Yes.

563
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,040
How old were you?

564
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,840
I was seven or eight years old.

565
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
What happened later?

566
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,400
When my nephew grows up,

567
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,720
when my nephew grew up.

568
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,720
You don't love him when you grow up.

569
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,440
In fact,

570
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
she's actually

571
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
she's a "scumbag".

572
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,520
She's from her own brother.

573
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
Really.

574
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,200
He does hold grudges.

575
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,400
I never thought

576
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,160
there would be such a thing.

577
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
He really holds grudges.

578
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,840
Scary Scorpio.

579
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,680
Scary?

580
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
Aren't you going to ask

581
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
some questions that force me to death?

582
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,640
Yes.

583
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,440
Think.

584
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,360
Come on.

585
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,120
Ask.

586
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
I think Xiaoling

587
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
doesn't fear us at all.

588
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
I don't think Xiao Ling is afraid at all.

589
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
This kind of thing.

590
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,720
I start to have 100 love problems.

591
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,080
Psychological (cheating) and body (cheating)

592
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,520
Choose one.

593
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,520
This is a bit sharp.

594
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,000
You must accept

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,320
You can only choose it.

596
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,400
Everyone, answer it.

597
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
OK.

598
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
I think...

599
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
Let me think.

600
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,040
I think

601
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,640
for me.

602
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,360
But if I have to choose,

603
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,520
I'll choose the body.

604
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
Mind the body.

605
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,120
Map.

606
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,480
I don't even need to think about it.

607
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,320
I have the answer.

608
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
It's hard to think.

609
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,400
Just imagine

610
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,520
he cheated on me.

611
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,240
Let me tell you.

612
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
I used to be a body.

613
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
I don't think I can accept it at all.

614
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
Now I'm completely awake.

615
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I think

616
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,400
you can think about it.

617
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,600
he had a relationship before.

618
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,080
No.

619
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,960
That's different too.

620
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,680
I don't think from this perspective.

621
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,080
I think it's body.

622
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,240
Because you know why?

623
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,600
I think it's right

624
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,560
Right?

625
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,360
You can't judge a book by heart.

626
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,440
Me too.

627
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,160
But I'm flawless.

628
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,320
But don't you think

629
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,000
if someone comes,

630
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
if someone comes.

631
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,520
But you have to control your behavior.

632
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,960
Because your behavior can be controlled.

633
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,760
You admire him.

634
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,000
I understand.

635
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,920
Even if

636
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,360
you think he's better than me.

637
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
But you controlled yourself.

638
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,000
You kept that promise.

639
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
You didn't give your body to anyone.

640
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,720
I think having an affair is scarier.

641
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,520
When you lie next to you,

642
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,600
your body

643
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,160
You might have

644
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
The map is on fire.

645
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,200
Put it in the pool.

646
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,360
This is wine.

647
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,520
Done.

648
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,040
I need to take my map home.

649
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,240
Speaking of this,

650
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,840
It's really a fierce topic.

651
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,200
Yes.

652
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
It's too sharp.

653
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,760
The map is on fire.

654
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
The map was on fire when he answered.

655
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,280
It means God doesn't agree.

656
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,680
God doesn't approve.

657
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,560
Did you steal my answer?

658
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,080
I said the same thing

659
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,800
I said the same thing as you.

660
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Really?

661
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,840
Yes.

662
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,320
No.

663
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,200
Harry asked me

664
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm not with you.

665
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,200
Yes.

666
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,160
Let me tell you, everyone

667
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
will change.

668
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,760
I used to think

669
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,720
too dirty.

670
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm not...

671
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,760
No.

672
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
I think the body was just impulsive.

673
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,120
The spirit is when you lie next to you.

674
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,520
He's thinking about someone else.

675
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,840
You think it's too scary.

676
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,760
But I really think so.

677
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560
I think you can

678
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,480
your body.

679
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,240
You are you.

680
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160
I made that choice.

681
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,000
Then...

682
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,320
I can

683
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,520
force myself to accept it.

684
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,120
He lost control.

685
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,600
But I couldn't accept him.

686
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,640
I don't love you anymore.

687
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,040
I only love her.

688
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,840
I can't accept that he doesn't love me anymore.

689
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,160
Of course I don't want either of them.

690
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,880
But if we have to choose,

691
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
we may be the physical team.

692
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
Spiritual.

693
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960
Spiritual.

694
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Don't cheat.

695
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
You two are physical.

696
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
Got it.

697
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,760
The text she sent was quite fun.

698
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,920
Tata told me not to waste my energy.

699
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,560
I thought

700
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
I said there must be a way before the mountain.

701
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,720
Let nature take its course.

702
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,840
I think everything is the best arrangement.

703
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,080
I sent the message to Harry.

704
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,880
I still want to ask him

705
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,920
what makes him unhappy

706
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,480
or

707
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,600
If anything upsets him,

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,880
you can tell me.

709
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,680
Don't let me guess.

710
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,760
I can help him

711
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,280
he can recover faster.

712
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
I can still feel that

713
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,920
some problems

714
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
some problems between us.

715
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
The text is for soup.

716
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,960
Send it to Susu.

717
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,240
Accept everything

718
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,400
and calm your heart.

719
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Feel your heart.

720
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Be strong.

721
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,000
I gave myself a lot of pressure before.

722
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,320
The soup and I

723
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
tense.

724
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,320
Now you need to put down your burden.

725
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,560
and be yourself first.

726
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
and contact each other.

727
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,880
Then we may become lovers.

728
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,960
In this situation,

729
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,040
I think our relationship

730
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,600
is improving.

731
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,160
I got Susu's

732
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm quite happy.

733
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,520
The message is for soup.

734
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,920
Because he gave me a puppy.

735
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,960
Put it on my bed.

736
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,480
I knew you were angry.

737
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
So I went to you.

738
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,680
Plus, both of us

739
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,600
in front of the bookshelf

740
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
in front of the bookshelf.

741
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I also read

742
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,320
called "Puppy Diary".

743
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,880
So I sent him

744
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,360
a puppy ID.

745
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
Hope you always solve problems

746
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,520
not me.

747
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
Then he posted a cute word.

748
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
It's like saying

749
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
what I want to say.

750
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,600
I received a message from you today.

751
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,160
It's 100% from Tu Tu.

752
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,320
Xiao Ling gave it to me.

753
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,880
I still sent it to Xiao Ling today.

754
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,720
In the following few days,

755
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
I felt like elementary school students

756
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,040
and middle school students.

757
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm very happy.

758
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Today I sent

759
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
a message to Tu.

760
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,120
He brought me milk tea this afternoon.

761
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
And he brought it for me.

762
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,200
Xiao Ling.

763
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,880
You're back.

764
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,520
Here.

765
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Milk tea?

766
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
You even brought me milk tea.

767
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,800
You're quite considerate.

768
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,320
I used it.

769
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,600
Their Hunan dialect

770
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
is very considerate.

771
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
My texts every day

772
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,960
to Map every day.

773
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,920
And he also sent it to me.

774
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,320
I can feel a lot of thoughts.

775
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,480
I'm similar to him.

776
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,960
We even meet each other

777
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,000
we often meet each other.

778
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
He mentioned the point of milk tea.

779
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
And he also mentioned

780
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,000
I can't beat him

781
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,720
I can't beat him.

782
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,680
That's the point.

783
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,480
He said he found out

784
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,560
physical affair.

785
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,760
we made the same choice.

786
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,360
I think it's the body.

787
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,640
Because you know why?

788
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,960
I think a gentleman shouldn't judge a person's mind.

789
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,680
but not the heart.

790
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Me too.

791
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,040
And these three points

792
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
even the order is the same.

793
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,320
So I think

794
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,920
there is someone like me.

795
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,680
I want to know more about him.

796
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Because he's like me.

797
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,960
I got a text from Tae-seo.

798
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,000
Because

799
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,920
our first date,

800
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,800
we threw darts.

801
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,360
Then I threw the ground

802
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
hit me higher.

803
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,080
So he told me today

804
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,400
he went to shoot this afternoon.

805
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
and won a big doll for me.

806
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,920
Before I distributed it to Hua,

807
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
when I was in Gucheng,

808
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
she told me

809
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,120
I might not be able to shoot her.

810
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,520
I want to prove myself.

811
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
I won her a big doll.

812
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,240
I don't want to roast you on fire anymore.

813
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,880
You're so handsome.

814
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,760
How many points

815
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,920
How many points did you give me?

816
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,000
Seven to eight.

817
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,520
How many points?

818
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
Not yet.

819
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,680
I don't know if Hua will...

820
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,880
text me.

821
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,720
I gave her

822
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,920
I gave her seven to eight.

823
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,280
She might not be satisfied with the score.

824
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,480
And I also said

825
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,800
I didn't feel it.

826
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,880
After hearing it,

827
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
when she heard it.

828
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,800
Tae-seo said

829
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,400
who doesn't know how to prepare a sense of ritual.

830
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,040
Actually, I'm not very happy about that.

831
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,280
I'm not very satisfied

832
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,640
with his grade.

833
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,800
I got a message.

834
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
It's floral.

835
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,240
Because the content is obvious.

836
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,920
At first, I thought

837
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,520
I gave her a grade

838
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,320
she will be angry.

839
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,080
But she thinks I'm sincere.

840
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
I also think

841
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
no matter who I am,

842
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,840
she thinks I'm a good person.

843
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,920
So we'll keep in touch and get along.

844
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
I think this message

845
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
is showing me her affection.

846
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
I texted her today.

847
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
I think

848
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
maybe

849
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,200
to develop our relationship

850
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
to make friends.

851
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,040
Without these two questions,

852
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,840
the answer he gave me,

853
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,120
I may want to

854
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,560
to develop in the opposite sex.

855
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,240
But he answered these questions

856
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,480
In my heart,

857
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,680
I feel

858
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm not satisfied.

859
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,480
I think

860
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,240
Well,

861
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,680
Actually, we can be friends.

862
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,440
I know Hua probably won't send it to me.

863
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,080
Right now.

864
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,440
I knew I wouldn't give you anything,

865
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,280
I'll say no.

866
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,800
No.

867
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
I don't want to say

868
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,840
what to do, right?

869
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,960
And others are giving warmth.

870
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,600
I told you.

871
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,760
I told her to observe first.

872
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,120
Right?

873
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,440
Why should I be so aggressive?

874
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,360
If you and Hua met outside,

875
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,680
would you still like flowers?

876
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,880
I can tell you

877
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,240
I will talk in real life.

878
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,480
Face yourself for real.

879
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
I really like you.

880
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,600
When it comes to love,

881
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,120
and communicate with it directly.

882
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,680
to solve the problem.

883
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,240
I can take the initiative

884
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,080
If I have a chance,

885
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,920
you'll have a chance to fight for it.

886
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,280
You'll get it if you're in love.

887
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,240
This is the real me.

888
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,560
After all, there's not much chance.

889
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,240
I don't want to regret.

890
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,640
And I think I should try my best.

891
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,760
It's been more than ten days.

892
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,680
every boy

893
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,720
has the girls they want to meet.

894
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,280
and have a private relationship.

895
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,880
Apart from being fat,

896
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,840
other boys

897
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,440
I didn't have any more time to chat.

898
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,560
I'll say no.

899
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm not surprised.

900
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,600
I think they get along well.

901
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,200
Maybe what happened yesterday

902
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,080
what happened yesterday.

903
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,760
Because he also

904
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,480
Tom also talked to Fatty.

905
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,880
And Susu is quite interested in him.

906
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,200
Tom is also interested in Susu.

907
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
And it took a long time.

908
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,960
I think Xiaoling

909
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,600
The current stage and the drawing

910
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,480
I think it's quite stable.

911
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,120
They have

912
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,240
that we don't know.

913
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,440
In my opinion,

914
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,560
Tarri and Fatty are 50-50.

915
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,120
Maybe

916
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,360
I thought Fatty was better.

917
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,159
But after getting along

918
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,719
with Tae-seo,

919
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,600
I think

920
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,760
he is a mature person.

921
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,480
So,

922
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,239
they split it half.

923
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,280
I think

924
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,040
in the room.

925
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,960
Nine.

926
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,639
0.9, 0.1.

927
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,840
Nine is with Tata.

928
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,679
The remaining 0.9 is

929
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,560
care about the soup and my sister.

930
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,120
I'll play with you at 0.1.

931
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Such heavy steps.

932
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,800
Fatty.

933
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,320
Let me tell you.

934
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,760
Do you know how many points

935
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,200
Do you know how many marks I gave you?

936
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,960
No.

937
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,880
Do you want to know?

938
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,520
No.

939
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,080
Okay.

940
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Take a guess.

941
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,200
Whatever.

942
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
Why are you so arrogant?

943
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,360
Do you want to know?

944
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,920
Okay.

945
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Are you going to tell me?

946
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,760
Do you want to know?

947
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,360
No.

948
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll kill you.

949
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,880
No, I'm not.

950
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,160
Because she has told everyone.

951
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,400
her desire to share

952
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,520
share half of it.

953
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes.

954
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,800
But she still wants to share

955
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,400
7.5.

956
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,160
Higher.

957
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,440
He's starting to be happy.

958
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,560
He's already happy, Flower.

959
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,880
Enough.

960
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,960
Is it 7.5?

961
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,200
Higher.

962
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,440
Your mouth is up again.

963
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,560
I took it back.

964
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,920
Put your lips down.

965
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,120
Will the full score be 100?

966
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,400
Ten points.

967
