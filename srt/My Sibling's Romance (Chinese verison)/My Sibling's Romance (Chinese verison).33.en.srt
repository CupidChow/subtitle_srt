1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Let's have some wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:48,960
Welcome, Flower.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Welcome, boss.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It feels like we'll have some wild wine.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:02,720
NIN.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #Exclusive game You have a chance to get a surprise benefit.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Go on Weibo. Take part in #Love siblings and friends observation room #Interaction You might be the next one to be flipped.

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,080
Hua.

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,039
I want to eat the noodles

14
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,240
you made that night.

15
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,800
You have to wait for a while if you eat noodles.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
Hua.

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
Come here.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,160
Here.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,479
Hurry up.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,720
Did you eat it yourself?

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,200
Not yet.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,039
Eat later.

23
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,039
That's it?

24
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,880
Hurry up.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
Thank you for coming.

26
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,960
It's really delicious.

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,160
Tu.

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,640
Eat the noodles first.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
I'll listen to you.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,039
Do you want some glutinous rice balls?

32
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,360
No.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,720
Glutinous rice balls are too greasy.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,200
But only a little bit of noodles.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
How about this small one?

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Here.

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,200
Sure.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
Let's have another bowl of glutinous rice balls.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,079
Because there's no size left.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
I don't need to give it to him.

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
The big one is for you.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Fatty.

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
Hua.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,240
You can eat big food.

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,800
He doesn't need to eat too much.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
This is too small.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,680
Map

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,320
This is from the Tu family anyway

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
He often eats it.

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
I do.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,760
His bowl.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Fatty, come and eat.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,480
The noodles Hua made for you are soggy.

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay.

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't delay.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
You have to treat it equally, okay?

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
It's really soggy.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,680
Half an hour is fine.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
That's all.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,400
The big bowl Hua specially left for you.

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,160
I believe it.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Look at this kind of person. OK.

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,640
Don't cook for him.

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
I won't do it again.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,360
The bag won't.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,840
I said I believe you.

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
I didn't say anything else.

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,520
I have something for you. Come here.

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I have something for you.

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
What is it?

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,840
When you put on makeup for me,

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
your makeup was almost gone.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,560
What is this?

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,280
A concealer.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,160
I don't know.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,280
What should I do?

77
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Thank you.

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
My old friend.

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,600
Did you miss me?

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,000
You got a text.

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,240
(To members of the house.)

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,960
A new week has begun.

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
I've prepared

84
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,200
for you.

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,520
Please go to

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,600
to the designated location.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
for dinner.

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Let's go.

89
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,880
This looks nice.

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,159
How do we sit?

91
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,000
Sit where

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,080
Sit here.

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,960
Fragrant juice wine.

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Fragrant juice wine.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,760
What should I do?

96
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm on a challenge.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,120
Feeling juice wine.

98
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,000
How to sit?

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,520
Sit over there.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,440
Nice.

101
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
Do you want to sit together

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
Thank you.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
Thank you.

104
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Oh, no. I got into trouble again.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,960
What should we eat?

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,200
Everything.

107
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll move them back after eating.

108
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,400
Do you want it?

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,560
I'll share it with you.

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,040
Guoli D is good.

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,320
Get me some paper.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Map? Such big ears.

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
My son is

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,840
a bright boy.

115
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
They say daughters are mom's little cotton coat

116
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Flowers are beautiful when they are born

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
He doesn't look like an old man.

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,040
I think my son

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,960
a standard man.

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,760
He's always been easy-going.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,560
I want to cry.

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,159
My son is reliable.

123
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,120
What I'm proud of is that

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
he can insist on doing something

125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,080
and persistent.

126
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
My daughter is very kind

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
and pretty.

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,200
who can understand others.

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,200
Xinxin, you're great.

130
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Trust yourself.

131
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,920
Do it well.

132
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,560
I want tissues.

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm going to play the video of my parents today.

134
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,040
It was a bit

135
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
a little tearful.

136
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
I haven't seen my parents for a long time.

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
So I couldn't control myself.

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
I kept crying.

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
Feels like mom is old

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,800
I suddenly got emotional.

141
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,920
Because at the moment

142
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
at the moment

143
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,200
I was a little emotional.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,960
I thought about siblings before.

145
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm pretty sure.

146
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,680
In the letter segment,

147
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
Both Susu and Harry are in the UK.

148
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
I knew it.

149
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
Susu and Harry are brothers.

150
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
are very different.

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm deeply touched.

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,600
A girl.

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,560
She's more attentive.

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,640
So detailed that when I was a kid,

155
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
You can't touch dirty things

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,040
But son is not like that.

157
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,280
I think boys

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,920
Touch it if you want.

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,720
It's relaxing.

160
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Susu was at

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
at a Chinese school.

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
I was going to send her abroad.

163
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,960
I remember this time clearly.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,600
She went there in August 2013.

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
She was born under September.

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,840
I came back to China

167
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,280
after her birthday.

168
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,160
Because two younger brothers

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
I can't accompany her abroad.

170
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm indebted to those years.

171
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,600
If I have to choose

172
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
If I can't be with you,

173
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,280
I won't send my child out.

174
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,640
Yes.

175
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
Think about it.

176
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,200
a little girl went to a foreign country

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,320
to a completely strange city.

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,280
Now I think

179
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,160
the pressure and growth

180
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,240
and growth.

181
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I went abroad when I was young.

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,360
I was alone in England.

183
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
So I think at that age,

184
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
at that time

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,280
a good view of life

186
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,200
and world view,

187
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,040
it's not good

188
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
to go abroad alone.

189
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,480
I think

190
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
I've always been

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
sensitive and internal consumption.

192
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
In junior high,

193
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,920
there was too much pressure in the girls' school.

194
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,840
I wanted to transfer to a school.

195
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
After I changed to another school,

196
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
I couldn't draw.

197
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,080
that I like.

198
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,120
I sit in front of the table

199
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
for two days and two nights.

200
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
I just want to draw it well.

201
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,200
But because

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,360
the more anxious you are, the more afraid you are.

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,400
You don't dare to go to class because you can't finish it.

204
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I was afraid of being scolded by the teacher.

205
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,640
Because I was afraid of being scolded by the teacher,

206
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,120
I couldn't draw well.

207
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,160
Then I fell into a dead loop.

208
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
I was very anxious.

209
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
I dare not go to school.

210
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
She was in puberty.

211
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,480
Her anxiety at that time

212
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,280
was relatively serious.

213
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
She has physical reaction.

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
She'll be nervous.

215
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Her hands are sweating.

216
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
Like when there are many people, she squats down.

217
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Like that.

218
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,320
At that time,

219
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,000
a dance training institution.

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,520
I started learning dancing when I was 13.

221
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,360
Chinese dance, folk dance

222
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,840
until the third year.

223
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
35 years old.

224
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Over 20 years.

225
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,280
When I was pregnant,

226
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,360
I was still teaching the students.

227
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,280
But after giving birth to the third child,

228
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,440
the mission of two children and three children

229
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
are totally different.

230
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
You have a younger brother.

231
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,200
I feel a lot of things happened suddenly.

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm choosing my career and my family.

233
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,320
I really fought for a long time.

234
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,240
In the end, I chose to return to my family

235
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,120
to take care of my child.

236
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,240
The most important thing is responsibility.

237
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,080
Because I have three children.

238
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,160
I have to educate them and guide them.

239
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,360
But now I don't regret

240
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
My lack of Susu

241
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,080
is the biggest problem in my life.

242
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,560
Yes.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,320
I always thought

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
they may not remember

245
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
remember or not.

246
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,960
Actually, they don't usually say this.

247
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,000
or tell me.

248
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,840
or apologize to me.

249
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,520
or anything.

250
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,920
For the first time,

251
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,960
I saw them like this.

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm an adult now.

253
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,160
I can figure it out.

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,360
Because I was the first child,

255
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,880
So they don't know

256
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,840
how to educate

257
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
or companionship.

258
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
I think

259
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,760
better than my sister.

260
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,640
Because

261
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,200
Like I said, parents are more experienced

262
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,920
they'll take more care of me.

263
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,800
Since it has happened,

264
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,480
it can't be changed.

265
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
If you think it's unfair now,

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,440
make up for this fairness.

267
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
That's enough.

268
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,680
How to make up for my sister?

269
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
Just spend more time with her

270
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
and make her happy.

271
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,920
Let her do what she wants to do.

272
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,880
What she wants to do?

273
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,040
My son is a family-oriented

274
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,920
and a man.

275
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,640
I've been her brother since childhood.

276
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
He is more mature

277
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
and good at taking care of his sister.

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,960
When I was young, my brother went to a restaurant

279
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
he would bring me something

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,560
he would bring me something.

281
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
He also brings me something he has.

282
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Because he will always think of me.

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,520
Like I said,

284
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,960
Make up for it if you can.

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,240
If you can't make it up, try to make it up.

286
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,360
Judging from

287
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,200
in the past two days,

288
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
he's just like this.

289
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
He's very attentive

290
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
and considerate.

291
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,640
Although he is Susu's brother,

292
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,840
he takes good care of his sister.

293
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,120
I hope my daughter

294
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,560
can find her other half in the show.

295
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
who loves and loves her.

296
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,360
Do you have any other requests?

297
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
If there's any hope,

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,080
you must choose someone you love

299
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,760
and show yourself bravely.

300
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,320
Let those who like you

301
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,200
who love you

302
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
can have the chance

303
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
to be with you in the future.

304
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,920
OK.

305
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
What impressed me the most is

306
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,280
Susu and Harry.

307
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
My understanding of Harry

308
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
I think he's actually

309
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,840
a very thoughtful man.

310
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
He's quite straightforward.

311
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,440
Very straightforward.

312
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
My observation

313
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,360
his love for his sister and family

314
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,520
He expresses his love.

315
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,280
and emotions.

316
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,360
I can feel his parents.

317
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
their parents are devoted to their children.

318
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,320
They know how to express love.

319
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
Hello, I'm Su Ziyi.

320
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
He is my brother,

321
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,760
Su Zihao.

322
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,120
I'm not used to it.

323
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,080
He suddenly said his name.

324
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,880
OK, Zihao.

325
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
So pretty.

326
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,200
So beautiful.

327
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Tom and Mi

328
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,320
are 14 months apart.

329
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,960
So many doctors advised me

330
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,400
not to keep this.

331
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,320
But of course I want to keep it.

332
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
Because I think if I have one,

333
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,080
The only problem I was worried about

334
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
is that my body

335
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,520
enough support and nutrition to Tom.

336
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,400
My daughter is very kind.

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,760
She has a rich world.

338
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,200
When she was young, she could take care of seven kinds of animals at the same time.

339
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,440
And she has many books.

340
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,360
Just find a bird

341
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
find a bird

342
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,040
she can tell you

343
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
what the name of this bird is.

344
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,080
What's his academic name?

345
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,360
For example, on TV,

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,520
I saw her saying, "How about the fish?"

347
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,000
she immediately told me ten minutes.

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,040
She is very observant

349
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,240
and soft-hearted.

350
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,400
She's quite introverted and shy.

351
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,560
Actually, I've thought about

352
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,960
what she would say

353
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,160
what she will say.

354
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,600
But what she said today

355
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,680
what she said today.

356
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,359
There's a kind of bird outside.

357
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,599
If you point it to Xiaoling,

358
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,640
she'll know the scientific name of the bird.

359
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,839
She actually remembers all these details.

360
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,680
But she doesn't say it usually.

361
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,319
When she mentioned this today,

362
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,280
I couldn't do it.

363
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
I feel my mom

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
still paying attention to me.

365
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,440
My son is a very serious person.

366
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
but he's reliable.

367
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,520
Many things

368
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,359
as long as he agrees to do it,

369
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm quite surprised.

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,400
Maybe she doesn't acknowledge me.

371
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
We don't usually communicate like this.

372
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,920
When she describes me,

373
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,600
she was proud and proud.

374
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm actually quite happy.

375
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
To Tom,

376
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,800
to Tom.

377
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,760
That's why

378
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,400
they are so good now.

379
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,600
I can feel that

380
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
a very strict mother.

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,040
I can relate to her.

382
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,440
But I think

383
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,160
they might be more strict.

384
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Wait.

385
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,160
I have a sister and a younger brother.

386
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,760
There are four of us.

387
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,480
It's obvious.

388
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,320
I didn't become an ambassador.

389
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,680
They're disappointed.

390
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
I don't think

391
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
you gave up those things.

392
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,800
But how many kids do you have?

393
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,440
He may cause you a lot of trouble,

394
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,760
but they change every day.

395
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,280
He is continuous.

396
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,080
So he may be

397
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,480
more proud of him.

398
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,840
There's an expiration date for parents.

399
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,240
That makes sense.

400
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,120
So it's better these years.

401
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,960
Because they are all grown up.

402
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
When they were young,

403
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,520
they didn't have

404
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,640
spare time.

405
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
saying that I went to entertainment.

406
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,960
she might have given up a lot for us.

407
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,280
But she...

408
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,160
for so many years.

409
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,680
for so many years.

410
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,000
My mom is very strong.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,680
I think

412
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
to do

413
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,520
meaningful to society.

414
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,120
a passionate career woman.

415
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,040
When she comes back to her family,

416
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,800
her dream and ambition

417
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,640
can only depend on the children.

418
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,400
The pressure I didn't understand before

419
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
I think I can understand it now.

420
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
Because this effort

421
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,640
is really huge.

422
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
So I think

423
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,040
I need to do more.

424
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,800
to match

425
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
to her.

426
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,840
She will discuss it in private.

427
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,440
But we

428
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,400
show it in front of my mom.

429
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Actually,

430
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I didn't say anything close to my mom.

431
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,320
Because I always think

432
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,680
when I get close to her,

433
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
I feel a little nervous.

434
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,480
or I want to show

435
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,400
my best side.

436
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Since I have memories,

437
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,440
I've accepted

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,800
accept

439
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,360
everything she gave me.

440
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,320
So what I want to say now is

441
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,800
Thank you.

442
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Thank you

443
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,400
It's really hard.

444
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,720
I want to tell my mom

445
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,680
although you are very strict,

446
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
and fierce sometimes,

447
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,080
But I know

448
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,400
it shows that you love us.

449
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
You care about us.

450
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,240
Maybe you want us to do our best.

451
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,880
so that we can

452
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,840
to support ourselves

453
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,440
and help her family.

454
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,360
And thank her.

455
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,560
Thank you for your hard work.

456
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,760
I think for girls,

457
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,280
I hope you can marry love.

458
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
But I hope

459
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,120
I hope to find

460
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
a soul mate.

461
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
OK. Come on.

462
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,040
Let me introduce.

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm Brandis.

464
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,960
And my Chinese name is Cao Xiaoling.

465
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,440
Cao Xiaoling.

466
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,320
Mimi.

467
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,680
Mimi.

468
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
You call me every time.

469
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Mimi.

470
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,680
Where is she?

471
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
So every time you call the kitten

472
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
in the small house,

473
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,480
I...

474
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm Tom.

475
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
And...

476
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,960
Okay.

477
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,200
What's your name?

478
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Only my sister and I have Cao's name.

479
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,840
He and my little brother don't have one.

480
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,800
Surprised?

481
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang.

482
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,680
They all guessed it.

483
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,160
Is it our turn?

484
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I think the probability

485
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,320
That was the right time.

486
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,120
I had a good condition.

487
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,280
I plan to have a second child.

488
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh no

489
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,840
When you're pregnant with your sister,

490
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,520
the others always teased me.

491
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,480
He said your mom will have a sister.

492
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,560
Sister?

493
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,000
When mom's voice came out,

494
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
I couldn't control my emotions.

495
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,160
It feels familiar

496
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,840
and listen to it on the big screen.

497
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I don't know how to describe it.

498
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm He Wenxin, He Wenjie's father.

499
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,880
He Wenxin.

500
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
He Wenjie

501
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,600
He Wenxin.

502
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,560
He Wenxin was fat when she was young.

503
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,360
I hoped she was a girl.

504
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,000
When she was born, she said she was a girl.

505
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
I was happy.

506
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
They talk about everything.

507
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,640
Whether they have a boyfriend

508
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,400
or a girlfriend,

509
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
we'll tell each other

510
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,480
Both of them.

511
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,760
We don't know.

512
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,320
In the interview,

513
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,440
Xinxin has a boyfriend.

514
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,400
she would also tell Fatty

515
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Fatty would also tell Xinxin

516
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,240
So they are

517
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,440
They are a fusion.

518
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:27,880
It's just

519
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,520
two different people.

520
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,760
more like friends.

521
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,160
So I think

522
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
this is a new

523
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't know.

524
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,640
Both children were cheerful when they were young.

525
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,120
It was because

526
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,560
Dad only talked to me.

527
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,320
And before I went abroad.

528
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,840
Back then,

529
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
I hid a lot of thoughts.

530
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
If I went back to that time,

531
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,840
I might not have done that.

532
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
I might try my best.

533
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,080
Even if the result won't change,

534
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,800
When my parents separated,

535
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,520
she was rebellious.

536
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,240
Her personality changed.

537
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,880
Actually, my personality changed a lot

538
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
because of this.

539
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,520
Very stubborn.

540
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,640
and persistent.

541
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,160
I don't like to communicate.

542
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
With my parents.

543
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,240
Because of this,

544
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,600
because of this.

545
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,240
Because of this,

546
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
because of this.

547
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,840
But I think

548
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,040
everything is the best arrangement.

549
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,360
Don't dwell on the past.

550
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
We've finally figured it out.

551
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
When she went to Singapore to study,

552
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,240
she asked me to go with her.

553
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
I'll go then.

554
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,320
I didn't pass the exam.

555
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,000
I came back.

556
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
She must have been looking forward

557
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,480
to study with her.

558
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,640
I think his changes

559
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,000
is very obvious.

560
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,040
Because I went abroad for a few years.

561
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,240
and he stopped accompanying me.

562
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000
After I came back,

563
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,440
he's taking care of others.

564
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,480
They are together every day.

565
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,440
How can I be at ease when He Wenxin is outside?

566
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,520
Because Fatty saw it.

567
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,000
But because

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,160
my dad has high expectations of me.

569
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,880
His discipline and education

570
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,040
gradually

571
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,960
through my brother.

572
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,440
So my brother

573
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
for me.

574
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,320
Only two people in my family care about me like this.

575
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm an adult now.

576
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,320
I might go home late.

577
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Maybe the next day, my brother would scold me.

578
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,120
I feel like

579
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
being protected.

580
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,280
and a little annoyed.

581
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,240
When I was driving in 2016,

582
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,520
when I was driving in 2016.

583
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,520
I was not

584
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,400
hurt.

585
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
But the car was badly damaged.

586
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
I didn't think

587
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,680
there was something wrong.

588
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,000
The next day, I received a long text

589
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,640
a long text message.

590
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,920
I was a little confused when I saw that text.

591
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,800
At that moment,

592
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,120
I wanted to cry at that time.

593
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,640
I didn't expect

594
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
my brother would think so much for me.

595
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,320
First, I'm worried about my personal safety.

596
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Second, she was worried

597
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,160
because I was

598
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
when I was young?

599
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,920
Did you encounter

600
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,240
or something bad?

601
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,520
I called her back then.

602
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
When I called her back,

603
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,440
she was still choking.

604
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,400
So at that moment,

605
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
I knew she cried a lot.

606
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
I was really touched.

607
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,120
If she is bullied in love,

608
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,760
I will stand out immediately.

609
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,000
As for their relationship,

610
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,080
I won't interfere in other things.

611
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,280
But I just can't see

612
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,680
my brother being bullied.

613
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,440
he will...

614
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,080
He gets involved in everything.

615
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,000
He's very involved.

616
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,720
The three are talking.

617
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
Xinxin.

618
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,880
to build my own family.

619
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,280
I wish you all the best.

620
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,760
Come on.

621
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,320
Bless her.

622
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,560
Come on.

623
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,920
Fatty, try to find yourself.

624
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,480
the girl you love.

625
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
Take good care of girls.

626
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
and make your career

627
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,160
my career.

628
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,640
This part

629
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,560
Not bad.

630
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,440
Xinxin is beautiful.

631
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,760
Yes.

632
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Let me introduce.

633
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,960
Hello, I'm He Wenxin.

634
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,360
He is He Wenjie.

635
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,760
I'm the elder brother.

636
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,040
Yes.

637
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,560
He's older.

638
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm his sister.

639
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
I love recording him.

640
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,320
When did this happen?

641
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,280
He kissed me cute when I was young.

642
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
Bye, Sister Wang.

643
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
I'll miss you.

644
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,320
When you were young,

645
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Now you've grown up.

646
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I didn't expect

647
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,840
to be so clingy

648
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
like this.

649
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
When I saw the map,

650
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,760
Those videos

651
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,480
This kind of video

652
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,360
I think

653
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,480
it's good to have such a brother.

654
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,400
I think childhood will be very happy

655
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
and happy.

656
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
We are

657
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,080
a family

658
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,320
a family.

659
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,280
I was quite surprised.

660
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,880
Because I didn't expect

661
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,760
they would be a family.

662
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,440
First, I know they are siblings.

663
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,640
But I didn't know they were half-siblings.

664
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,280
I feel sorry for them.

665
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,720
Then I went to Guangzhou.

666
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,160
When I left Ze,

667
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,960
Mom.

668
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
I want my mom.

669
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,720
This scene

670
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
has always been in my heart.

671
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,640
In my memory, I didn't see her cry.

672
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,120
I didn't expect her

673
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,080
so sad.

674
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,400
Yeah.

675
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Because in my memory,

676
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,360
my mom has always been

677
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,800
is always very cheerful.

678
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,960
I think everything can be over.

679
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,360
So when I saw her cry,

680
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,640
I couldn't help it.

681
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,040
I'd rather she didn't record this.

682
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,600
I don't want her to cry when she remembers the past.

683
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,960
Don't cry.

684
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
I'll call my mom.

685
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,400
I can't get through.

686
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
Because the person who called my phone in Guangzhou

687
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,800
I have to add a zero to get through.

688
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,520
My mom didn't tell her that zero.

689
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,960
I felt guilty.

690
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
I feel sorry for her.

691
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,280
Yes.

692
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Hua called her.

693
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,560
I can never get through to her.

694
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm going to cry.

695
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,280
I can't imagine my life without my mom.

696
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,560
It's okay.

697
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,080
Now I know

698
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,840
I missed a zero.

699
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
if I missed one zero.

700
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,560
Even if my business is good or bad,

701
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,080
she just cares about your health.

702
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,120
Are you tired?

703
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,280
Are you happy?

704
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,520
Hua's sensibility touched me.

705
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,640
It's true that a little girl

706
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,040
That was the most touching.

707
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,200
I can understand that

708
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
in the small house.

709
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,040
and taking care of everyone.

710
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,280
Tae-seo.

711
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,440
I cooked yours.

712
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,520
It's not spicy.

713
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,160
But I think she wants someone

714
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,000
someone to take care of her.

715
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
After all, in this growth environment,

716
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,240
she must lack love.

717
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,320
I think she doesn't feel secure.

718
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,720
but she pretended to feel safe.

719
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,280
Hello, everyone.

720
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm Yu's mom.

721
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,360
and Xiaomei's mother.

722
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,560
Yu's dad was my first love.

723
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,800
I was with him in my twenties.

724
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,160
When Yu was a year old,

725
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
my dad got sick.

726
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,880
Yes.

727
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
He passed away when he was four.

728
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,360
To me,

729
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,520
I felt like my world had collapsed.

730
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,200
He didn't tell me much.

731
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,480
He didn't tell me in language.

732
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
What do you want?

733
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,160
When I went hiking,

734
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,680
he only asked me

735
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,840
Will you remarry?

736
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,840
I didn't know

737
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,680
how to answer him.

738
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,880
If I told him I wouldn't remarry,

739
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,440
he might think it's not real.

740
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
He didn't believe it either.

741
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,199
But I said I would remarry.

742
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,320
He must be in pain.

743
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
He might not be able to leave in peace.

744
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,840
This is the only language he gave me.

745
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
In his will,

746
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,560
in his will,

747
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,800
he still trusts me.

748
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,080
I think I will carry on his responsibility.

749
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,800
I can feel

750
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,040
he gave me.

751
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,600
I haven't let go of this relationship.

752
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,760
My love for him

753
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,520
to the child.

754
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
So young.

755
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
When Tu was four years old,

756
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
his father passed away.

757
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,000
I feel sorry for him.

758
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
But when I grew up,

759
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,360
when I was the most frustrated,

760
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,480
is not because of physical strength.

761
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,760
When kids

762
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,720
doesn't listen to me,

763
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,320
I would think

764
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,640
I could beat him up if my dad was here.

765
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,120
Actually, when the kid is good,

766
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I thought

767
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,400
I want to share this joy with others.

768
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,840
But no one shared it.

769
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,200
Yes.

770
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,240
Son.

771
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,440
Son.

772
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,400
But when I was young,

773
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,520
I remember it clearly once.

774
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,280
In a painting class,

775
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,360
the teacher asked us to draw family members.

776
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
But I really don't know why

777
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,440
I didn't draw my mother.

778
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,120
or siblings.

779
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,200
I didn't draw anything.

780
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I only drew my dad.

781
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,640
I remember

782
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,040
there was a moon on my painting.

783
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,800
He stood on a balcony

784
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,840
watching the moon with me.

785
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,800
I thought about him.

786
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
So I drew him out like this.

787
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,280
and carved it.

788
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,720
Maybe it's a thought from my childhood.

789
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,040
Yes.

790
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,960
When I shaved my head and had chemotherapy,

791
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,240
and lying in the hospital bed.

792
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
That was my last impression of my dad.

793
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,280
I miss him.

794
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,800
I didn't expect

795
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,440
in the video

796
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,360
in the video.

797
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,080
So I

798
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,560
I might not have the chance

799
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,960
to call my name again.

800
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,160
Actually I thought

801
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,080
to find a dad for him.

802
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,080
But I found

803
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,720
I still think it's inappropriate.

804
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,600
Maybe

805
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
someone else's father

806
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
or

807
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
not his real father.

808
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,800
He can never replace this role.

809
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,800
Gradually, I still

810
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,040
by myself.

811
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
She keeps asking me

812
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,280
why don’t you find someone

813
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,400
When I was a teenager,

814
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
I found a younger brother for me.

815
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
I said I don't want to.

816
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,560
I only love you.

817
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,480
I don't want to share this love with others.

818
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,760
I only love you.

819
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,520
I think after my dad passed away,

820
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,800
there's more than one person

821
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,600
is not just one person.

822
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
My mom.

823
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,480
my brother,

824
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,600
and my brother's mother.

825
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,320
I don't know.

826
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,000
Both mothers

827
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,440
are great.

828
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,600
Because

829
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,880
they have to

830
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,640
to take care of two children.

831
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,720
and maintain a good family

832
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,120
and raised both of them well.

833
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,440
And the drawing and Huahua

834
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
are very good.

835
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,280
I think Tu Tu

836
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,240
can accept this child.

837
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,040
Flowers can also

838
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,880
Their love

839
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,360
really touched me.

840
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,000
the efforts of my parents.

841
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,160
That kind of love is indeed

842
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,000
is that

843
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,680
sitting there makes you feel touched.

844
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,240
That's why you feel that it's not easy for your parents.

845
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
They haven't kissed me since they grew up.

846
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,760
Let me do it.

847
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,680
I can't do it.

848
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,200
I think drawing and flowers

849
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,960
are best at expressing love.

850
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,160
They want each other to know

851
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,560
he's being loved.

852
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,080
and making up for

853
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,440
each other's missing father's love.

854
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,440
In fact, I think

855
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,240
like this,

856
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,040
I can't do better than her.

857
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,480
I think Hua is

858
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,960
that I really want to make.

859
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,200
And I hope

860
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,480
he would try harder to protect you.

861
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,040
Let me introduce.

862
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm Tu.

863
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,200
My full name is Wang Jiu.

864
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,440
I'm Tsu from the universe.

865
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm Hua Hua.

866
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm Wang Yin-tong.

867
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,400
The silver of the bank, the calcium of three o'clock water.

868
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,320
So you just named the map.

869
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,280
The map is based on

870
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,320
characteristics.

871
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,600
His ears are big.

872
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,800
So if you like it, we'll call you Tu.

873
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
or Yu?

874
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,600
It's called Tu.

875
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,360
He likes drawing.

876
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,800
Okay, I'll call you Tu.

877
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,840
Although

878
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,960
the atmosphere of the video

879
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
a little...

880
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,760
a little heavy.

881
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,320
Why is it so serious every time it's our turn?

882
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,440
Yeah, but actually we...

883
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,600
You really can't see it.

884
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,280
we are very positive in daily life.

885
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,880
We won't cry about anything.

886
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,400
Solve it on the day when something happens.

887
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,720
And it never consumes internal energy.

888
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,440
You can kick him

889
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:14,880
in every corner.

890
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,080
It's wrapped.

891
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,480
It's true that we haven't noticed it for so many days.

892
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,640
Neither did I.

893
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,480
I just found out.

894
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,280
Isn't this my sister?

895
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,160
Yes.

896
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,800
Everyone thinks we are siblings.

897
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,200
This is you.

898
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,400
Tata.

899
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,480
So cute.

900
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,280
This hair

901
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
is so cute.

902
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,000
You've always had this hairstyle.

903
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,600
We planned to get the second one.

904
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm a little shy to see it.

905
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,480
And I suddenly thought of my childhood.

906
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
I would ask

907
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,400
who gave birth to me.

908
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,640
I was curious.

909
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,720
Dad told me

910
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,960
He said it was the whole family.

911
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,040
My dad was the only one who wanted me to stay.

912
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
It's indeed because I gave birth to my brother.

913
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,360
It's only been two years.

914
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,680
But my dad insists that

915
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,120
I should be born.

916
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,520
Since I was young,

917
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,400
Dad's scale

918
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,280
is leaning towards me.

919
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,640
I think my dad really loves me.

920
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,080
My name is Tata.

921
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
Rorin.

922
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,000
When I was a sophomore,

923
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,520
my brothers took me into the industry

924
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,840
to be models.

925
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,400
Hello, everyone.

926
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
My name is Kai.

927
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,320
This is my brother.

928
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,720
So handsome.

929
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
So handsome.

930
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,360
You're finally here.

931
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,280
He looks a bit like you.

932
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,720
He looks like you.

933
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,920
Really.

934
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,560
She's a group pet

935
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,120
She grew up with the care and care of her family

936
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,440
He was a good student

937
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,960
He loves pets.

938
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,080
Having a daughter

939
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,520
About five hours

940
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,160
about five hours.

941
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,880
About four or five hours.

942
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,640
Because there was a power outage.

943
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
Then our comrades just said

944
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,120
to call her a blackout.

945
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,320
A blackout?

946
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,440
My daughter is a very beautiful

947
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,040
and adorable little girl.

948
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,720
So small.

949
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
So cute.

950
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,080
In the eyes of others,

951
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,960
they are all very polite.

952
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,640
Just like now

953
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,680
So cute

954
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,000
My family said

955
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
they are the best dish

956
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,760
The best dish.

957
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,000
The most beautiful dish.

958
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,840
That's what it means.

959
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,680
When he said that,

960
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,360
I couldn't believe it.

961
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,520
My dad said that.

962
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,640
To be honest,

963
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,800
I would put a lot of love and emotions

964
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,000
and emotions.

965
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,000
The money they earned

966
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,680
secretly changed a car for me.

967
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,400
It makes me proud.

968
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,480
I think good love

969
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,720
tolerate each other

970
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,440
and help each other.

971
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,680
and accompany each other.

972
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,960
Dad will change himself because of his mom.

973
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,400
I think this is a rare point.

974
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,520
It will still affect

975
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,360
on our love view.

976
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,080
Daughter,

977
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,360
You have the courage to pursue your own life.

978
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,320
We are here.

979
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,800
are your strong support.

980
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,560
Come on.

981
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,840
Come on.

982
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,640
To be honest,

983
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,840
I should envy Tata's family the most.

984
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,600
I just feel

985
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,360
has been well protected since childhood.

986
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,280
Her dad and her mom

987
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,560
is also good.

988
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,640
A life environment since childhood

989
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,280
should be very happy

990
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,680
a carefree childhood.

991
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,120
the happiest family.

992
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,880
I think it's Tata's family.

993
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,680
Both of them are very relaxed

994
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,800
and make jokes.

995
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,400
No matter how old you are

996
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,280
Keep it up.

997
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,480
Okay.

998
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,040
Let me introduce. I'm Rollin.

999
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,120
I have a brother called Lo Ling Kai.

1000
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,720
We've actually

1001
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,360
filmed these interviews together.

1002
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
But later,

1003
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,200
when he was about to come in,

1004
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,840
he couldn't come

1005
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,400
because of work.

1006
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,840
I came alone in the end.

1007
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,960
Tata, we have brothers and sisters.

1008
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,440
Are you lonely now?

1009
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm so sad.

1010
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,000
I cried.

1011
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,920
When my brother didn't come,

1012
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,080
I cried right away.

1013
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,600
So fragile?

1014
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,800
I wanted him to accompany me.

1015
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
I might be better.

1016
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,880
But he didn't come.

1017
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,920
Then I came up alone.

1018
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,200
That's okay

1019
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,720
That's okay

1020
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,880
We're under a lot of pressure.

1021
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,720
Yeah, we're under a lot of pressure too.

1022
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,960
And...

1023
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,840
Definitely.

1024
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,720
All of you

1025
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,640
have siblings in the house.

1026
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,440
I feel lonely

1027
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,400
alone.

1028
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,600
Thinking about him is one thing.

1029
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,400
I actually resent him in my heart.

1030
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,640
I wondered why he didn't come.

1031
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,400
Then we can introduce each other.

1032
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,360
I won't say I'm alone.

1033
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,840
alone here.

1034
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,280
about someone who hasn't been here.

1035
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
Don't leave me alone next time.

1036
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
I'll be happy if I know my sister isn't here.

1037
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,720
No.

1038
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,160
I can't.

1039
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,360
I can be myself.

1040
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,920
I only have a fake brother.

1041
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,680
Cover my ears.

1042
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,600
I'll post it on Moments to scold Ling Kai.

1043
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Can you play

1044
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,080
Play my real brother.

1045
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,680
Don't I look like one?

1046
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,040
Really?

1047
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,080
You said you would make me breakfast.

1048
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,920
I didn't have a meal.

1049
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,560
Me too.

1050
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,640
I eat flowers and Harry.

1051
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,560
I'll make it tomorrow.

1052
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,400
I'll make it for you too.

1053
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,520
No, it's on the way.

1054
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,560
Do it for your sister.

1055
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,320
It's okay. I can do it myself.

1056
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,680
We have two kids.

1057
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,280
One daughter and one son.

1058
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,560
They are outgoing.

1059
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,480
But Yuan Bo is more shy.

1060
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,520
Yuan Bo,

1061
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,960
I have a sister seven years older than me.

1062
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,040
She's a fashion stylist.

1063
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,120
Long time no see.

1064
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,440
Long time no see.

1065
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,560
I think brothers mean

1066
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,200
to me.

1067
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,480
who always stands behind me.

1068
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,160
or when

1069
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,360
in the family,

1070
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,120
you'll be the first one

1071
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,040
to solve the problem.

1072
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,560
Maybe that's why

1073
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,640
I always call him Bobo.

1074
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,120
Yinbo.

1075
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,800
I have sisters and younger brothers.

1076
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,000
Very close

1077
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,240
We're always together.

1078
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,920
I think

1079
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,160
we can't do it.

1080
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,680
When I was young, I watched TV and grabbed the TV.

1081
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,960
and beat him up.

1082
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,520
Because my impression of my childhood

1083
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,360
when I was young.

1084
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,760
It's quite deep in my memory.

1085
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,560
Isn't that good?

1086
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
Otherwise, when you were young,

1087
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,480
when you were a kid.

1088
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,520
You should thank me.

1089
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,200
I should thank you for getting beaten up.

1090
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,280
You need to experience pain to grow up.

1091
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,280
Right?

1092
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,560
We fought a lot when we were kids.

1093
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,560
because she didn't want to spend her time

1094
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,760
on me.

1095
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,160
When I was young,

1096
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,640
all my attention was on you.

1097
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,560
So I think

1098
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,360
my love was separated.

1099
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,200
I wrote in my composition that my mom valued men over daughters.

1100
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,720
Writing?

1101
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,360
When my dad saw my composition,

1102
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,600
and the whole family read it.

1103
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,600
Because our family values men over women.

1104
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,320
And my sister

1105
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,880
my parents care more about me.

1106
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,440
She may dislike me.

1107
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,360
I may not have a brother.

1108
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,760
Maybe her parents

1109
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,960
on her.

1110
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,440
But my dad is fine in this aspect.

1111
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,800
I think my mom will be more serious.

1112
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,880
in all aspects.

1113
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,880
I think my stubbornness is my resistance to them.

1114
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,520
Go to Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou.

1115
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,000
I arranged high-speed rails all the way.

1116
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,840
She smiled at me on the top of the mountain

1117
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,560
"What are you going to do?"

1118
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,120
She said she was going to pray for you.

1119
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,720
I felt a huge gap.

1120
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,600
She was

1121
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,000
being treated differently at home.

1122
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,240
Maybe

1123
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,360
when she was in college, she worked half-time,

1124
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,600
And she went to Shanghai alone.

1125
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,640
without any relatives

1126
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,240
or any friends.

1127
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,600
She went alone.

1128
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,240
I think these moments

1129
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,080
these moments.

1130
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,240
I feel sorry for myself too.

1131
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,560
I'm about to cry.

1132
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,920
I owe my sister a lot.

1133
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,960
Sometimes she comes to tell me something.

1134
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,080
I may not take it to heart.

1135
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,680
including when she texted me on WeChat,

1136
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,720
I don't reply to her messages.

1137
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,920
And sometimes

1138
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,360
long voices, you know?

1139
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,520
I don't even want to listen to it.

1140
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,000
Then I didn't reply.

1141
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But it doesn't matter to me.

1142
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,040
You don't have to reply.

1143
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,120
It's okay.

1144
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,040
Although my sister

1145
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,160
didn't come to this show with me,

1146
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,200
But I think

1147
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,840
I can handle everything well.

1148
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,440
I want to say

1149
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,960
you are really excellent.

1150
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,160
I'm proud of you

1151
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,560
are very proud of you.

1152
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,600
You are the best

1153
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,480
in our hearts.

1154
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,160
During the show,

1155
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,440
don't be too stressed.

1156
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,760
Put down your mind. Come on.

1157
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,200
Come on.

1158
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,640
Can I call you Yinbo?

1159
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,240
Sure.

1160
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,640
Bobo, introduce yourself.

1161
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,640
Hello, my original name is Yuan Bo.

1162
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,760
My sister's name.

1163
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,400
Yuan Qiong.

1164
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,760
How did you know?

1165
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,640
I remember.

1166
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,480
I just put it in.

1167
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,840
Okay.

1168
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,440
I feel

1169
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,840
get to know you again today.

1170
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,600
Why don't we have a toast with the fruit cube?

1171
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,800
OK.

1172
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,520
Cheers.

1173
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,760
Cheers.

1174
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,360
I found that everyone had ten cups.

1175
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,960
different mixed drinks.

1176
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,840
Really

1177
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,600
It's good no matter how you mix it.

1178
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,040
Sprinkle water.

1179
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,480
It's good.

1180
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,160
Very good.

1181
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,480
Let's introduce

1182
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,520
where you came from.

1183
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,360
From Xiaoling.

1184
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,080
Where are you from?

1185
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,680
Beijing.

1186
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,840
Introduce it in dialect.

1187
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,200
Beijing, Cao Xiaoling.

1188
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,360
Let's do this.

1189
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,680
Beijing, Xiao Ling.

1190
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,080
We'll use your dialect.

1191
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,400
Our dialect is dialect.

1192
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,040
I can't speak Chinese.

1193
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,880
My hometown is northeast.

1194
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,600
But I grew up in Beijing.

1195
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
I'm a member of the Virus.

1196
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,000
Are you really from the Viwu clan?

1197
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,520
Yes.

1198
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,640
What?

1199
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,280
You believe everything I say.

1200
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,920
You're so easily fooled.

1201
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,200
I've been in England.

1202
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,920
In these seven or eight years,

1203
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,000
Tata is your turn.

1204
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,320
I'm from Sichuan.

1205
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
And in Shanghai,

1206
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,480
Missy.

1207
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,080
I’m from Zhejiang.

1208
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,080
Ningbo?

1209
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,520
Yes.

1210
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,960
I'm in Shanghai now.

1211
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,640
Shanghai.

1212
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,520
In Shanghai.

1213
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,960
I'm from Xiangxi.

1214
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,840
Jiangxi.

1215
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,600
Xiangxi.

1216
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,640
Really?

1217
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,120
We are minorities.

1218
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,160
Miao?

1219
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,680
No.

1220
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,520
Earth family.

1221
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,200
Xiangxi is a native family.

1222
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,360
That's what our dialect says.

1223
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,440
but it's similar to Sichuan dialect.

1224
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,120
I know you're from Guangdong.

1225
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,760
I'm He Wenjie.

1226
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,680
I'm from Guangdong.

1227
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
Let me introduce.

1228
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,520
We're from Jiangxi.

1229
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,880
Jiangxi?

1230
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,800
Do you still want to introduce your family?

1231
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,720
We're from Shandong.

1232
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,120
How about this?

1233
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,000
Well,

1234
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,360
We are from Guangdong.

1235
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,880
And then Guangdong Zhuhai.

1236
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,800
Yes, we are from Zhuhai.

1237
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,160
We were born in our hometown.

1238
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,440
and lived in Zhuhai.

1239
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,960
Yes.

1240
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,800
Actually, I don't think

1241
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,560
my accent.

1242
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,000
I mean very standard.

1243
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,760
You mean very standard.

1244
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,840
Is my accent that obvious?

1245
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,320
Very obvious.

1246
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm already pressing the tone.

1247
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,200
I think I'm very standard.

1248
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,360
You're really funny.

1249
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,120
You too.

1250
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,280
What are you laughing at?

1251
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,840
What's wrong with me?

1252
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,560
I'm just a bit tone.

1253
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,080
I speak

1254
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,440
Mandarin is quite standard.

1255
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,400
Right?

1256
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,880
I'm really standard.

1257
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,640
More standard than me.

1258
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,880
OK, my turn.

1259
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,520
I think we will speak our hometown dialect.

1260
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,520
So sometimes I can't change

1261
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,000
to change.

1262
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,160
We like to talk when we see each other.

1263
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,240
He was a broadcaster,

1264
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,000
so he didn't have that tune.

1265
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,200
I might have a little bit of tune.

1266
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,400
I really want to ask

1267
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,080
how to say that?

1268
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,160
Her father will have...

1269
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,280
My dad actually...

1270
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,200
He hopes that he'll be able to do well.

1271
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,640
But he won't show it.

1272
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,520
I'm old.

1273
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,440
Maybe my grandma

1274
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,160
has four children.

1275
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,400
Four are sons.

1276
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,320
Every son

1277
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,120
want a boy

1278
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,240
All boys?

1279
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,560
Yes.

1280
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,280
And my grandma really wants a grandchild.

1281
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,320
When I was a kid, Tu and I

1282
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,880
I might ask my grandma

1283
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,760
some pocket money

1284
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,280
or even 100 yuan.

1285
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,440
my grandma might be reluctant.

1286
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,320
But my brother was so young that year.

1287
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,800
He said he wanted to learn drums.

1288
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,920
I gave him tens of thousands of yuan right away.

1289
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,040
a set of drums.

1290
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,280
The day before I asked her

1291
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,320
the day before I asked my grandma for money.

1292
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,640
Were you sad?

1293
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
Of course.

1294
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,000
I think it's a bit...

1295
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,480
But I've been used to

1296
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,520
the concept of men over women.

1297
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
Including when I was born,

1298
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,320
I knew it.

1299
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,520
my family values men over women since childhood.

1300
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,520
Although you see me

1301
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,280
control him,

1302
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,920
Yes.

1303
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,040
But at home, I dare not

1304
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,560
at home.

1305
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,480
Because I will be scolded.

1306
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,720
or say,

1307
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,320
How could you do this to your brother?

1308
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,960
On the contrary,

1309
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,080
our family values women more than men.

1310
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,520
Actually, it doesn't mean that women are more important than men.

1311
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,280
It's actually love.

1312
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,480
But education is different.

1313
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,520
Our family is poor to raise boys.

1314
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,720
A rich girl?

1315
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,400
When I was a kid, I was starving.

1316
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,120
I was like this.

1317
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,680
It's similar.

1318
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,280
It was our pocket money when we were young.

1319
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,320
I spent ten yuan in middle school and she paid 100 yuan.

1320
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,440
It's normal.

1321
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,560
So when I was in college,

1322
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,160
I felt like I couldn't stand it.

1323
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,520
Because she is good at studying.

1324
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,320
I didn't study well since I was a kid.

1325
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,360
He was

1326
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,040
was kind.

1327
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,320
I have a personality.

1328
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,200
He's a good boy.

1329
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,880
When I was in college,

1330
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,280
when I was in college.

1331
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,760
Actually, I'm a fierce person.

1332
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,440
Yes.

1333
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,760
He will be fierce in private.

1334
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,440
multiply by three times.

1335
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,280
I'm scared.

1336
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,360
Can't you keep it?

1337
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:54,640
Yes.

1338
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,600
That's good.

1339
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,400
I'll say these few days

1340
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,480
cherish these days.

1341
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,560
Be good to me.

1342
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,440
Actually, when I came here,

1343
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,680
I never tell her

1344
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,400
to express my feelings.

1345
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,120
I have to take care of her.

1346
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,640
I want to protect her.

1347
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,480
Actually, I won't.

1348
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,320
But as long as someone bullies her in life,

1349
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,200
I'm the kind of person

1350
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,160
I'll call you.

1351
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,520
Yes.

1352
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,240
I don't even know when he finished.

1353
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,720
Then I said

1354
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,480
why he disappeared.

1355
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,680
I'm so jealous. I want a brother.

1356
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,600
I'm so jealous.

1357
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,760
She's so hard to fall in love.

1358
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,080
because of me.

1359
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,040
We went out for a party

1360
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,480
At the party,

1361
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
some friends

1362
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,640
For example,

1363
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,360
when I think Xinxin is good,

1364
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,640
I would stand up and say,

1365
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,600
Are you sure?

1366
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,080
You're exaggerating.

1367
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,560
So I can't date.

1368
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,120
you can understand.

1369
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,760
Then they said,

1370
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,440
you can try another way.

1371
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
It's too hard to talk about.

1372
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,240
including some boys in our circle

1373
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,800
want to know my sister,

1374
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,440
he will consider our relationship.

1375
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,400
He broke up with my sister.

1376
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,720
Will he break up with me?

1377
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,000
Yes.

1378
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,040
Because it's very simple.

1379
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,440
if you break up with my sister,

1380
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,840
you'll lose me too.

1381
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,320
This is real.

1382
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,880
We had a friend

1383
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,440
liked her so much that she wanted to pursue her.

1384
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,680
I thought about it for two months.

1385
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,440
He said, "Forget it, I choose my brother."

1386
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,360
Do you hate him, Xin?

1387
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
A little.

1388
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,480
Suddenly I feel a little annoying

1389
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,360
What should I do?

1390
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,760
Actually I learned to talk properly here.

1391
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,000
We also communicate these days.

1392
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,880
I said I cherish these days.

1393
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,840
In fact,

1394
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,320
I never communicate with.

1395
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,160
But you're willing to teach me.

1396
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,560
Yes.

1397
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,680
He's willing to tease me.

1398
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,800
He teases me and plays with me every day.

1399
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,280
I really...

1400
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,000
He's different when he's with his friends.

1401
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,680
He gets nervous about everything about me.

1402
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,760
or frown.

1403
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,040
I really think

1404
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,560
he's afraid of Xinxin.

1405
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,680
I think so too.

1406
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,600
Xinxin kept telling him

1407
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,200
she said stop eating.

1408
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,680
Stop eating.

1409
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,960
Don't touch it.

1410
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,360
I'll just tell him to stop eating.

1411
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,280
I won't say anything else.

1412
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,800
Help me with the rest.

1413
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,120
Go and get some.

1414
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,680
Yes, I think so too.

1415
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,840
So you think he's afraid of me.

1416
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,400
Yes.

1417
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,040
Actually, yes.

1418
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm a victim.

1419
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,480
I'm afraid of her.

1420
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,840
because I might love her more.

1421
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,520
So scary.

1422
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
The last sentence is so scary.

1423
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,880
That's why I saw others being siblings.

1424
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,560
That kind of warm scene.

1425
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,040
I was a little jealous.

1426
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,600
I told him why.

1427
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,040
I said others have breakfast every day.

1428
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,240
He said you would cook it yourself.

1429
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,360
Why didn't I have breakfast?

1430
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,040
Yes.

1431
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,280
No.

1432
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,080
I think Harry takes more care of you.

1433
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,480
Really?

1434
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,320
How long are you going to England?

1435
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,640
Then Harry.

1436
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,600
I don't remember.

1437
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,080
Two or three years.

1438
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,560
You two...

1439
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,600
Do you live together after you go?

1440
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,520
No.

1441
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,200
We...

1442
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,280
I live in the school.

1443
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,320
At first, she was at Cambridge.

1444
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,200
I was in Wensha.

1445
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,120
I'm at the girls' school.

1446
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,400
Yes.

1447
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,680
Then I went to Cambridge.

1448
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,920
and she went to London.

1449
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Then I went to London from Cambridge.

1450
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,800
and she came back.

1451
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,040
Right.

1452
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,680
And then...

1453
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,560
Last year when I came back to London,

1454
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,280
I stayed in London for a year.

1455
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,000
Yes.

1456
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,240
We just

1457
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,480
living together in England.

1458
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,160
for only a year.

1459
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,000
So you don't see each other

1460
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,560
in England.

1461
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,520
Yes, every weekend.

1462
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,120
I live in the school.

1463
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,840
I live in a male school.

1464
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,520
I live in school too.

1465
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,720
I'm a girl's school.

1466
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,640
Just cook for a week this weekend.

1467
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,360
and give it to her.

1468
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,720
Who is stronger?

1469
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,640
Me.

1470
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,360
You...

1471
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,440
Really?

1472
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,000
Your brother looks gentle.

1473
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,360
Yes.

1474
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,400
He has a stable personality.

1475
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,440
He won't lose his temper.

1476
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,960
He always tolerates me.

1477
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,480
Look at our wine.

1478
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,400
After watching that,

1479
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,640
you still want me to be here, right?

1480
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,320
Juice wine.

1481
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,240
Of course.

1482
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,480
It's okay.

1483
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,000
My family won't have

1484
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,000
My sister and my parents

1485
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,680
are relatively independent.

1486
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,320
We may not contact each other for months.

1487
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,520
That's all?

1488
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,360
You haven't contacted your sister for months.

1489
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:56,640
Yes.

1490
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,960
You don't even contact each other in the same city.

1491
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,000
No.

1492
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,880
Except for something,

1493
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,040
There's really something.

1494
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,680
That's why we got in touch.

1495
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,880
Both of you are in Shanghai.

1496
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,120
Why don't you ask us out for dinner?

1497
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,160
Sometimes.

1498
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,560
We're in the same circle.

1499
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,280
But

1500
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,120
we have our own lives.

1501
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,400
Yes.

1502
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,120
Did you get along with other girls today?

1503
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,360
No.

1504
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,160
Why? You don't have time?

1505
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,360
I don't know.

1506
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,080
I'm so passive.

1507
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,240
But from now on,

1508
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,920
you should take the initiative.

1509
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,880
Like this?

1510
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,960
So if you want to get along,

1511
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,600
I think you can use these two days.

1512
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,600
You're so generous.

1513
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,120
No.

1514
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,840
Because you told me you have...

1515
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,840
Take a look.

1516
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,680
Will you send it to me today?

1517
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,040
What are you doing?

1518
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,760
Excuse me.

1519
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,560
Just follow your heart.

1520
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,480
Why are you asking this?

1521
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,360
Crazy.

1522
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,480
That's weird.

1523
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,680
What are you doing? You have to make sure.

1524
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,320
Then I won't.

1525
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,480
Whatever.

1526
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,880
I won't.

1527
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,320
Did you not understand yesterday

1528
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,960
or your ability to understand?

1529
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,240
I can understand.

1530
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,360
I think you're talking nonsense.

1531
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,800
Really.

1532
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:03,560
Ready

1533
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:03,680
NC

1534
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,800
Why are you looking at me?

1535
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,560
Look over there.

1536
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,640
That's what you want to see.

1537
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,200
Stop peeking.

1538
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:20,960
Turn around.

1539
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,160
Mance

1540
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,560
Nance

1541
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,120
Mance

1542
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,400
She's really a tough girl.

1543
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,880
I feel sorry for her.

1544
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,040
Today's message

1545
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,800
I'm still the same as yesterday.

1546
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,840
like yesterday.

1547
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,720
I told her

1548
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,280
I want to take care of her.

1549
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,600
I want to know more about her.

1550
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,760
I received two messages from her today.

1551
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,920
I think Fatty and Tarri

1552
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,280
I was touched when they sent it.

1553
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,320
They were comforting me.

1554
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,720
and they want to care about me.

1555
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,040
I've been thinking about it for a long time today.

1556
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,960
Whom should I send the message to?

1557
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,760
I received a text today.

1558
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,840
I guess it's still flower-haired.

1559
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,880
The content is

1560
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,360
Although my siblings are not around,

1561
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,160
everyone will be with me.

1562
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,400
I think the consolation will be bigger.

1563
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,920
A little bit.

1564
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,440
It may not be as much as comforting.

1565
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,960
Today's message

1566
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,640
is sent out with friendship.

1567
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,440
Because I think in this small house,

1568
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,920
in this house.

1569
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,360
But Tae-seo might be lonely.

1570
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,440
So I sent it to Tae-seo.

1571
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,640
I texted Tu today.

1572
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,280
After knowing his family story,

1573
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,520
I really admire

1574
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,760
I really admire them.

1575
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,720
I think their inner energy

1576
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,640
is too powerful.

1577
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,680
I'm 100% sure

1578
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,880
the map sent it.

1579
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,560
He told me directly

1580
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,200
in the message today.

1581
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,760
don't worry about the pressure from your family.

1582
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,440
So I think he knows me better.

1583
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,120
And at that moment,

1584
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,760
I just want to see this person.

1585
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,120
So far,

1586
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,560
I still want to know more about Xiaoling.

1587
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,240
Maybe she was a little strict

1588
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,640
when she was a kid.

1589
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,680
I want to make her happy

1590
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,840
to make her happy.

1591
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,680
Forget about the past.

1592
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,720
Just be happy and healthy.

1593
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,840
I'll send you

1594
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,240
to Tu.

1595
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,280
Because I think his video

1596
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,720
touched me.

1597
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,400
I'm also encouraging the drawing.

1598
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,600
I'm happy for Hua.

1599
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,400
He's such a good boy.

1600
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,000
I hope he can do it.

1601
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,640
Because I think she and my sister

1602
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,400
are about the same age.

1603
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,360
And I think

1604
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,200
the way she gets along with me

1605
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,439
are very similar to my sister.

1606
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:19,680
So I really

1607
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,600
totally

1608
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,439
as my sister.

1609
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,439
Map.

1610
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,479
That way, we'll be a loving family.

1611
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,920
I got a text from the soup.

1612
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,479
I sent a lot.

1613
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:01,359
It's quite attentive.

1614
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,800
It's quite sincere.

1615
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,080
She's watching my movies seriously.

1616
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,319
Now I know her growth experience.

1617
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,680
I know her too.

1618
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,200
she would be nervous

1619
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,520
and nervous.

1620
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,760
Since I chose to trust her,

1621
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,840
and I want to believe her.

1622
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:26,160
I think I should take the next step.

1623
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,160
What is a soul mate for you?

1624
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,080
She saw what my mom said.

1625
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,920
My mom wants me to find a soulmate.

1626
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,200
I'm curious about the soup.

1627
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,280
What kind of person

1628
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:58,920
is he?

1629
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,640
Or is he looking for

1630
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,680
a soulmate?

1631
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,800
My soulmate.

1632
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,640
I used to think

1633
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,760
that you could comfort me and support me

1634
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,800
comfort me, understand me and support me.

1635
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,520
But after I came to the small house,

1636
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,720
I changed my mind.

1637
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,880
The definition of a soulmate

1638
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,520
is not just my dependence.

1639
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,600
I need to learn

1640
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,680
to take care of others' thoughts and emotions.

1641
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,440
At the same time, I want to be her support.

1642
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,680
Why are you looking at me?

1643
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,560
Can't I?

1644
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,680
You're so stingy.

1645
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:19,960
Did you take a photo?

1646
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,400
Let me take one for you.

1647
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,320
I'll take one for you.

1648
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,840
Can I trust you?

1649
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,560
You'll know when you wash it.

1650
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,000
Are you sure it looks better?

1651
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,320
Don't pressure me.

1652
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,080
I moved.

1653
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,120
You did. No, you didn't.

1654
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,840
Probably.

1655
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,280
One more.

1656
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,320
Okay.

1657
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,400
Nice.

1658
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,400
Three, two, one.

1659
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,320
Okay, it didn't move this time.

1660
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,000
Thank you.

1661
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,040
You're so slow.

1662
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,280
What are you doing?

1663
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,200
Nothing.

1664
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,160
I thought you were...

1665
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,720
Mance.

1666
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,120
I received

1667
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,160
a very sweet text message.

1668
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,960
It makes me happy anyway.

1669
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,800
But I think

1670
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,440
my emotions

1671
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,400
are very different.

1672
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,200
I received a text

1673
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,440
a very calm text.

1674
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,360
The whole text

1675
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,440
very plain.

1676
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,760
I can't feel his emotions.

1677
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,120
I added some expressions

1678
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,440
and some words.

1679
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,600
I even added

1680
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,400
add more content,

1681
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,200
he just summarized

1682
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,680
today's short video.

1683
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,320
After watching your video,

1684
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,040
your family is very similar to mine.

1685
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,840
I feel a sense of gap.

1686
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,320
So I want to send three words tomorrow.

1687
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,720
She looks a little cold

1688
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,800
she looked a little cold.

1689
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,280
So I know she's angry.

1690
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,960
I don't know why I wrote that.

1691
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,400
I'm not that simple-minded.

1692
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,200
So I'll apologize to her tomorrow.

1693
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,760
I won't do it again.

1694
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,320
Who can save me?

1695
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,680
When I didn't receive the reply,

1696
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,320
I was a little confused.

1697
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,120
You can see my expression now.

1698
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,960
I was a bit serious.

1699
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,120
And she's really angry.

1700
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,440
I've sent her

1701
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,440
for two days.

1702
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,600
and every day during the day,

1703
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
I'm already very proactive.

1704
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,040
I think

1705
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,560
feel my feelings.

1706
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,040
I think

1707
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,080
very obvious.

1708
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,680
I think she can understand my feelings.

1709
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,880
But in her heart,

1710
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,240
she wants to know more about Terri.

1711
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,080
So today,

1712
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,880
if I don't receive your message,

1713
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,720
I'll probably know what's going on.

1714
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,520
Your eyes are full of red blood.

1715
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,480
Are you that tired?

1716
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,320
I'm crying.

1717
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,360
The contact lenses are too dry.

1718
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,680
They said my brothers

1719
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,120
received a sincere message today.

1720
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,680
from Susu.

1721
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,720
When I read this message,

1722
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,840
I said it was from Susu.

1723
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,320
So, who sent it today?

1724
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,800
Then I took a look at Susu first.

1725
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,560
and said, "Think about it."

1726
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,720
I sent it to Tu today.

1727
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,240
To see the flowers.

1728
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,400
I don't know why.

1729
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,560
We both look up

1730
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,480
and look at each other.

1731
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,000
for about three or five seconds.

1732
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,880
Why?

1733
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,400
My brother received

1734
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,240
a sincere message.

1735
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:36,960
Tata.

1736
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,600
I want to laugh.

1737
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,480
Wait.

1738
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,600
Happy.

1739
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,320
Okay, we're full and full.

1740
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,040
Let's go home.

1741
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,800
Let's go.

1742
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,760
Let's go.

1743
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,840
Let's go, Su Zihao.

1744
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,120
Okay, Mi.

1745
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,480
I have 18 friends named Zihao.

1746
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,600
Zihao.

1747
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,600
It's freezing.

1748
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,080
Today's message

1749
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,440
I think we should talk.

1750
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,160
Xinxin.

1751
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,360
Xinxin.

1752
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,360
I think she can feel

1753
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,600
my feelings.

1754
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,280
I think I've made it very obvious.

1755
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,960
I just need to confess.

1756
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,680
If I don't receive your message today,

1757
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,560
I'll probably know

1758
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,600
what's going on.

1759
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,600
Did you send it to the map today?

1760
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,000
Yes.

1761
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,080
Can you see it?

1762
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,400
Yes.

1763
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,600
It seems to have changed.

1764
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,480
It says your brother.

1765
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,240
How many messages did you receive today?

1766
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,520
from whom and who.

1767
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,640
So who else?

1768
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,960
You sent it to the map?

1769
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,160
I sent it to him every day.

1770
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,880
Really?

1771
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,200
I sent them to him.

1772
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,440
to encourage him.

1773
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,160
Really?

1774
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,120
Yes.

1775
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:14,440
It's okay.

1776
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,840
I'm texting you again today.

1777
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,440
I'm also encouraging you today.

1778
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,680
Who?

1779
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,720
To encourage those who have no siblings.

1780
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,120
I understand

1781
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,160
I understand.

1782
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,760
You encouraged him.

1783
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,360
But some people may not understand.

1784
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,840
I think it's also possible.

1785
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,960
I'll talk to him first.

1786
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,520
Okay.

1787
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,840
Fatty.

1788
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,040
Tu is not here.

1789
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,760
I talked to her just now.

1790
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,240
Then she said,

1791
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,120
she sent it out of friendship.

1792
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,120
because she thought she had no siblings.

1793
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,800
and sent it to someone who has no siblings.

1794
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,080
The point is I still have one word.

1795
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,320
If we didn't talk about

1796
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,400
about yesterday's secret mirror (House),

1797
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,640
I think it makes sense.

1798
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,400
We're done talking.

1799
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,320
After that,

1800
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,320
I think my performance today

1801
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,480
is very obvious.

1802
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,080
Do you think you hinted to her?

1803
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,080
You don't know me?

1804
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,480
Everyone has different standpoint.

1805
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,960
Girls may think they have their own considerations.

1806
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,280
I can understand what makes you unhappy.

1807
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,440
is your anger.

1808
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,400
What do you think now?

1809
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,920
I won't contact her anymore.

1810
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,480
No need.

1811
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,760
Where is it?

1812
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,120
It's a sincere message.

1813
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,480
She sent it to Tae-ri yesterday.

1814
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,920
That's because they went on a date yesterday.

1815
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,160
And today,

1816
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,520
I can't accept that at all.

1817
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,480
I can't accept it at all.

1818
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,360
I won't...

1819
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,640
Actually, I've been working hard

1820
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,680
and that.

1821
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,560
I think the love she thinks

1822
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,960
may be

1823
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,360
make her breakfast every day.

1824
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,480
who makes breakfast for her every day.

1825
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,360
No.

1826
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,040
Of course not.

1827
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,240
Then enjoy the next day.

1828
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:37,800
No.

1829
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,240
I don't think it's possible.

1830
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,480
Since I'm on this show,

1831
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,280
I just want to say

1832
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,000
I have no choice.

1833
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,520
That's not the reason.

1834
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,840
At the beginning,

1835
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,920
a few days ago,

1836
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,920
Now I think

1837
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,920
it's been ten days.

1838
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,680
We know who to aim at.

1839
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,640
It's normal.

1840
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,080
And yesterday, I already...

1841
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,080
Yesterday?

1842
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,560
We asked that question directly.

1843
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,280
The question we discussed together is

1844
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,240
Will you discriminate?

1845
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,080
She said yes.

1846
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,120
Is it discrimination?

1847
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,440
Different?

1848
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,480
I'm the one being discriminated.

1849
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,640
But is it possible that

1850
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,920
Maybe she wants to know more about Tae-seo.

1851
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,160
Because they went on a date.

1852
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,880
We can't just blindly think

1853
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,200
she didn't follow her heart.

1854
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,600
This is not what we can guess.

1855
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,120
Maybe

1856
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,760
I'm presenting

1857
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,600
I just want to

1858
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,560
I don't know anything else.

1859
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,600
Maybe others won't understand

1860
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,280
Why are you doing this?

1861
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,000
But everyone has a different personality.

1862
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,040
Fatty didn't receive his message today.

1863
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,040
He's a little unhappy.

1864
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,280
He thinks he knows more about

1865
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,800
about flowers and flowers.

1866
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,760
including these three days.

1867
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,840
he sent

1868
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,960
to Hua.

1869
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,080
But Hua didn't send it to him today.

1870
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,960
He was a little depressed.

1871
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,080
So I'm a little worried.

1872
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,160
Fatty will give up.

1873
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,960
Okay, I got it. It's okay.

1874
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,800
You should have a good chat.

1875
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,520
Forget it.

1876
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,560
I know what to do.

1877
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,040
Hello, Tu.

1878
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,720
Why are you ignoring me every day?

1879
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,800
I'm sorry.

1880
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,880
You're such a good sister.

1881
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,640
You're a good person now.

1882
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,080
No.

1883
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,920
Yes, very sincere.

1884
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,080
So I'm very happy.

1885
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,280
Thank you very much.

1886
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,240
Fatty didn't receive his message.

1887
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,280
He's a little upset.

1888
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,240
I think my sister

1889
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,240
she doesn't have

1890
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,440
for Tae-seo.

1891
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,560
But after seeing that today,

1892
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,840
she turned to Fatty today.

1893
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,760
she might think Tarri is very...

1894
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,000
And his brother isn't here.

1895
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,640
I don't think that's the reason.

1896
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,200
I don't understand.

1897
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,120
Fatty can't understand.

1898
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:11,800
Because first,

1899
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,680
First, they don't have a date today.

1900
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,280
Secondly, it's a love message.

1901
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,680
It's a heart.

1902
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,560
It's not sympathy.

1903
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,200
You can use other ways

1904
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,520
For example, we will play together.

1905
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,320
We'll use many ways

1906
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,880
to make him feel not lonely.

1907
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,720
But you're not

1908
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,720
send a message

1909
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,200
to tell him.

1910
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,160
And she knows

1911
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,280
Fatty likes her.

1912
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,480
And she asked

1913
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,000
if Fatty will send it to her.

1914
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,880
After all, Fatty

1915
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,720
in the past three days.

1916
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,680
Yes.

1917
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,000
He thinks he doesn't understand

1918
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,320
what Hua did.

1919
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,480
Why did they fight?

1920
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,360
or something.

1921
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,280
when you look at him from a different angle,

1922
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,800
you'll find that he thinks he's right.

1923
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,400
She thinks she's right too.

1924
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,920
Because no one is perfect.

1925
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,480
She would think if she didn't send it to Tae-seo,

1926
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,520
He has no one.

1927
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,440
Tarri, no one can say it.

1928
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,720
She thinks it's cruel.

1929
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,200
Because she has been

1930
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,320
with Terri these days.

1931
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,400
I haven't been in touch with Fatty for a long time.

1932
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,120
No, I think sometimes

1933
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,080
she neglects the feeling of being fat.

1934
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,760
She can ask Terri about it.

1935
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,160
And she can also say that

1936
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,960
he doesn't have his sister by his side.

1937
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,680
But I think we should

1938
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,120
about the message.

1939
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,320
It's not like that.

1940
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,200
That's why I'm giving this feeling to you.

1941
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,440
I want to text you my feelings.

1942
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,680
and cheer for you.

1943
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,240
But Tae-seo treats her differently.

1944
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,200
Tae-seo likes her.

1945
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,640
What he accepted is different.

1946
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,840
So I can understand that you didn't send it to me.

1947
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,040
But...

1948
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:50,640
Right?

1949
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,640
Fine, I'll talk to her.

1950
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,240
What is she doing down there?

1951
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,280
Let me tell you.

1952
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,320
I hesitated for a long time today.

1953
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,400
but you still sent it to Tae-ri.

1954
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,760
I didn't send it

1955
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,640
because I like Tae-seo.

1956
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,640
Those texts sent

1957
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,400
I think he and Tata

1958
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,560
have no siblings in this house.

1959
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,760
I still want to give him some comfort.

1960
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,640
I think if he didn't receive

1961
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,960
his feelings today,

1962
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,560
I...

1963
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,960
I think it's too miserable.

1964
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,640
But it doesn't mean

1965
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,840
just friendship.

1966
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,240
I don't think

1967
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,760
I have feelings for Tae-seo.

1968
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,640
I sent this letter.

1969
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,960
Of course.

1970
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,240
Do you know

1971
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,160
is?

1972
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,520
The Mirror Room.

1973
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
I asked Fatty.

1974
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,680
Before Tae-seo came in,

1975
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,600
he didn't send it to me for two days.

1976
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,080
I asked him yesterday

1977
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,520
I mean it's more fun to have a sports day.

1978
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,760
or go on a date with me?

1979
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,360
He said he liked dating with me.

1980
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,200
But after the sports day,

1981
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,040
he still sent it to Xiaoling.

1982
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,520
But I think he wants me

1983
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,640
to understand his behavior.

1984
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,320
I really don't understand.

1985
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,960
So when he sat next to me today,

1986
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,440
he was testing me.

1987
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,800
So I don't know how he feels?

1988
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,040
I was wondering how I knew you.

1989
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:27,960
I don't know at all.

1990
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,080
Although you're nice to me,

1991
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,360
I think he's nice to Xiaoling too.

1992
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,000
He said

1993
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,360
He said he was happy to be with me.

1994
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,360
But his actions and actual actions

1995
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,880
including his last date.

1996
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,800
he brought back a gift.

1997
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,480
It's also for Xiaoling.

1998
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,400
Really?

1999
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,760
I brought her a fish tank.

2000
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,880
I thought it was strange.

2001
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:48,960
But I asked Tarri

2002
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,680
if he wants to meet other girls.

2003
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,520
He said yes.

2004
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,840
So I asked him

2005
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,400
I asked him too.

2006
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,720
Hey.

2007
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,600
Did you contact other girls today?

2008
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,280
He said no.

2009
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,280
Just do it if I say you want to.

2010
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,600
He said I was generous.

2011
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,280
I said what?

2012
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,400
When did I care about you?

2013
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,320
I think I know

2014
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,240
how they feel.

2015
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,280
But

2016
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,840
Fatty may have seen it.

2017
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,640
Everyone may think I'm the most suitable one.

2018
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,320
but I haven't seen it yet.

2019
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,800
But I think

2020
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,760
I was the one

2021
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,440
I always took the initiative.

2022
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,800
Although I can continue to take the initiative,

2023
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,000
but I didn't get a good result.

2024
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,120
So I want to try something different.

2025
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,040
But now Tarri

2026
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,440
is more passive.

2027
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,640
My point of view now is

2028
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,600
you and Fatty go offline.

2029
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,640
Let's talk like this.

2030
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,080
No.

2031
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,560
I don't think Fatty and I can talk normally.

2032
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,440
Don't be afraid of having an offline chat.

2033
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,680
I think he doesn't want to talk to me now.

2034
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,200
I don't want to touch this wall.

2035
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,440
It's okay.

2036
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:52,880
Come on.

2037
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,200
I don't want to touch it.

2038
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,000
Just touch it.

2039
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,960
I don't want to touch it.

2040
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,560
What are you afraid of?

2041
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,880
Let's go to the romantic house together, okay?

2042
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,520
Sure.

2043
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,200
I think this is

2044
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,120
a good way.

2045
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,160
I think I might go to Fatty

2046
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,080
to talk to Fatty.

2047
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,040
So I'm sorting it out.

2048
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,560
I think after I'm done,

2049
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,720
and talk to him.

2050
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,080
instead of asking him a question.

2051
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,110
Just ask him one question.

2052
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,560
Okay.

2053
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,680
Soup.

2054
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,400
Who's calling me?

2055
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,680
Come here.

2056
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,560
What's wrong?

2057
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,240
Are you upset?

2058
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:54,720
What did I do?

2059
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,280
Didn't you tell me something?

2060
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,150
After dinner,

2061
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:02,110
On the way back,

2062
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,760
Fatty is going to collapse.

2063
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,760
So?

2064
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,550
Okay.

2065
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:09,080
I'll explain to her.

2066
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:11,680
Okay.

2067
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,080
Explain to her.

2068
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,000
She's very sad.

2069
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,840
Indeed, I should tell her.

2070
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,240
It's so hard.

2071
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,240
I heard you got angry earlier.

2072
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,280
No.

2073
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,560
It's nothing.

2074
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,760
I'm not angry.

2075
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,680
For example, if you make him unhappy,

2076
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,230
You make him angry.

2077
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,120
He cares about his feelings.

2078
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,200
But he can't observe others' feelings.

2079
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:34,800
You know?

2080
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,920
Yes.

2081
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,950
He's too self-centered.

2082
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,200
He's not a meticulous person.

2083
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,280
But I think he is sincere enough.

2084
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,360
I asked him

2085
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,870
Is it the same state

2086
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:44,560
in the same state?

2087
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,680
He said it's not like that at all.

2088
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,480
What?

2089
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,520
Tom Cat.

2090
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,990
He's not romantic.

2091
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,840
He's not considerate.

2092
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,560
He doesn't care about my feelings either.

2093
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,160
He didn't tell me when he was angry.

2094
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,320
He's narrow-minded.

2095
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,150
and not considerate.

2096
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,200
Yeah.

2097
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:02,680
Oh no.

2098
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,200
Stop it.

2099
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
You have to talk again.

2100
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,390
She doesn't want to talk to me now.

2101
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:08,120
Tata.

2102
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,680
She's a little annoying.

2103
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,830
I think I sent it too proactively today.

2104
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:15,280
Actually, I regret it.

2105
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,080
I think the text is very plain.

2106
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,520
It makes me look worthless.

2107
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,550
Why didn't you order me?

2108
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:25,310
Do I have to ask you to order me?

2109
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:26,270
I wanted to tell you.

2110
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,360
But I forgot.

2111
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,320
Hello.

2112
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,040
Your Ziyi is back.

2113
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,000
Do you want to go?

2114
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,520
I was stunned just now.

2115
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,240
I just came back.

2116
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,480
You can go.

2117
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,080
Where?

2118
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:44,350
I just came back.

2119
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:45,240
I just went back to my room.

2120
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:47,960
So funny.

2121
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,080
Come up and have a chat.

2122
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:52,670
Okay.

2123
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:54,360
Let's go.

2124
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:01,880
I heard you were a little upset.

2125
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:02,910
How did you know?

2126
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,480
I'm not upset.

2127
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,600
But fortunately,

2128
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,270
I'm not unhappy.

2129
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,360
I didn't want to ask you.

2130
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:12,400
Because Xin told me

2131
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,600
Fatty was a little upset.

2132
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,630
Because Hua didn't send it to him.

2133
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:19,320
I think so.

2134
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,990
And...

2135
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:22,880
Maybe I didn't think too much.

2136
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,960
But how did you know about this?

2137
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,880
telepathy.

2138
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,040
Impossible.

2139
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,200
Someone must have told you.

2140
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:27,760
No.

2141
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,560
No way.

2142
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,280
Liar.

2143
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,400
Tata reminded me.

2144
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,560
Okay.

2145
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,680
It's quite awkward.

2146
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,760
Because I didn't want to talk about this.

2147
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,360
At first,

2148
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,000
But Tata told me

2149
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,670
she was a little unhappy today.

2150
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:41,470
She said she was annoyed.

2151
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,800
but I don't know what she's upset about.

2152
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,400
She said she felt

2153
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,480
she sent it sincerely.

2154
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,990
She thinks Harry isn't that sincere.

2155
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,750
but she thinks it's sincere.

2156
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:51,440
I feel

2157
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,990
But I was too proactive.

2158
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,040
We have similar personalities.

2159
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:54,910
We are a little stubborn.

2160
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,280
Am I not sincere?

2161
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,000
No, your text is very sincere.

2162
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,240
I also told Tata.

2163
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,360
Okay.

2164
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,710
I don't want to make you unhappy.

2165
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,600
But I'm not happy.

2166
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,560
Not this.

2167
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,230
I think

2168
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,960
sometimes

2169
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,960
you only care about your feelings.

2170
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,550
You care.

2171
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,040
I made you uncomfortable,

2172
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,680
or I made you unhappy,

2173
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,640
But you didn't care.

2174
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,080
If you do this,

2175
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,110
if you do this?

2176
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:28,280
How do I look?

2177
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:36,440
You may feel a little uncomfortable.

2178
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,560
what I did

2179
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:41,040
what I do

2180
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,480
will affect others.

2181
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,240
But I didn't think about that.

2182
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,520
Can I understand that?

2183
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,640
It doesn't mean it'll affect others' mood.

2184
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,590
or my mood.

2185
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,440
I'm sorry.

2186
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,520
It's okay.

2187
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,640
I forgive you.

2188
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,350
It's amazing that I'm here.

2189
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:05,470
I can change a lot of things.

2190
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,840
Is there anything I want to change?

2191
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,640
Do you?

2192
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:11,840
No.

2193
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,720
I can say

2194
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:16,240
Because I like to hear

2195
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,840
people's thoughts and impressions.

2196
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:21,440
Think about it.

2197
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,830
For example, my words

2198
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,560
I don't know.

2199
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,560
Maybe I...

2200
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,800
I talked to Fatty.

2201
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,440
Because I thought we were too bored.

2202
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,310
We were bored.

2203
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:44,240
I really want to talk to you.

2204
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:44,960
And...

2205
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,640
But I don't know how to talk to you.

2206
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,110
He actually said

2207
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:55,200
my...

2208
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,400
Like what I did that night.

2209
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,960
Maybe my emotions are written on my face.

2210
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:02,960
Brother Tata.

2211
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,480
You were supporting me.

2212
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,070
But I felt very sad.

2213
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,030
Are you jealous?

2214
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,120
A little.

2215
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,600
I felt very sad.

2216
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,720
Then...

2217
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,080
I felt bad on the spot.

2218
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,040
I felt bad for a moment.

2219
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,670
Did you want to leave?

2220
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,150
I already...

2221
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:21,360
Yes.

2222
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,760
I don't really want to hear the letter.

2223
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,110
You cried so much.

2224
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,000
There.

2225
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,720
I'm so mad.

2226
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,840
So annoying.

2227
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:32,670
Yes.

2228
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,950
Dan told me

2229
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:34,720
I think so too.

2230
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,560
I'm too sensitive.

2231
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,070
and too agitated and nervous.

2232
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:40,510
and think too much.

2233
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:42,800
Not only is it not good for myself,

2234
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,990
but also for girls.

2235
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,350
And maybe when I get along with you,

2236
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,110
when I was with you.

2237
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,800
So I don't feel so relaxed.

2238
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,840
I don't joke with you.

2239
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,280
But I've been joking with you.

2240
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,560
I should be relaxed.

2241
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,840
You can do anything like this.

2242
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,520
and make everyone happier.

2243
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,830
Many things are improving.

2244
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:06,200
It's quite interesting.

2245
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,190
I think

2246
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,000
in a way of joking.

2247
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,480
Or you can ask me.

2248
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:13,360
For example, on that night,

2249
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,400
you would ask me

2250
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,190
Do you really think he's handsome?

2251
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:17,680
I think he's cute.

2252
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,800
But if you get angry

2253
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,630
and shake your face,

2254
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,160
But I...

2255
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,360
I can see that you're angry.

2256
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,160
But you didn't tell me.

2257
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,280
Why are you angry?

2258
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,040
If you refuse to communicate again,

2259
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,960
I'll get angry.

2260
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,440
It turns a very small thing

2261
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,950
a big misunderstanding.

2262
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,880
Nothing really happened.

2263
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,200
OK, Sunny.

2264
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:43,710
Yes.

2265
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:44,350
Okay.

2266
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:45,400
Thank you, Tom.

2267
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:52,190
I've been...

2268
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:53,790
When Tata and her brother were interviewing,

2269
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:55,280
when Tata and her brother interview.

2270
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,350
I dare not say anything.

2271
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,720
Everyone says you're so handsome.

2272
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,160
I knew it.

2273
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,200
Shut up!

2274
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,680
Stop talking.

2275
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,800
I'll change it slowly.

2276
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,240
Should I be angry or angry?

2277
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,680
Because it's impossible

2278
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,110
change because of a small matter.

2279
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:11,680
For example, your personality

2280
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,830
for over 20 years.

2281
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,400
But you can open your mouth.

2282
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,390
We can use it if we have mouth.

2283
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:20,440
Please.

2284
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,320
Yes, but I didn't want to tell you

2285
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,560
to tell you today.

2286
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,750
Just tell Tata.

2287
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,960
I think it's a small matter.

2288
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,470
She even mentioned it to me.

2289
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:32,600
I don't want you to be unhappy.

2290
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,440
But I think you're unhappy.

2291
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,280
I'm quite happy.

2292
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,000
You're happy when I'm not happy.

2293
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,120
Why?

2294
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,720
Because you care about it.

2295
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:43,960
Okay.

2296
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,200
I don't know.

2297
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:49,280
When I came back,

2298
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:49,840
I was hesitant.

2299
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,000
Should I say it?

2300
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,320
No.

2301
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,120
I went to find you.

2302
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,270
and didn't find you.

2303
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,760
Why are you looking for me?

2304
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,790
I want to stay with you.

2305
01:37:58,430 --> 01:37:59,160
You want to stay with me?

2306
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,120
Why didn't you stay with me in the car?

2307
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,590
General.

2308
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,040
I hold a grudge.

2309
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:14,880
I'm sorry.

2310
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:16,920
No.

2311
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,360
I didn't expect to be jealous.

2312
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,800
I'm not jealous.

2313
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,630
I think

2314
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,840
you only care about your feelings.

2315
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,320
You don't care about my feelings.

2316
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,470
When I made you uncomfortable,

2317
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:27,360
when I made you uncomfortable.

2318
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,440
When you make me uncomfortable,

2319
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,160
I'm normal.

2320
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,680
I'm narrow-minded.

2321
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,960
I'm not that petty.

2322
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,640
I praised myself.

2323
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,200
I didn't praise myself.

2324
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,870
I just stepped on it.

2325
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,640
Okay.

2326
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:43,760
Okay.

2327
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,480
But you didn't

2328
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,590
because I sent you

2329
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,800
because I didn't text you today.

2330
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,000
No, I think you care about the details.

2331
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,390
I'm not upset.

2332
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:58,000
I've been sending you a message.

2333
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:01,400
Because

2334
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,880
I'm not sure

2335
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,750
if you will...

2336
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,470
I don't know other words.

2337
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm not sure

2338
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,760
if you like me too.

2339
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,440
I'll use this word.

2340
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,110
This word may be a bit heavy.

2341
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:24,510
But I'm sure of one thing now.

2342
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:26,240
that you're also interested in me.

2343
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,720
So I might try to

2344
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,480
to send you more.

2345
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,840
They're using expressions now.

2346
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,280
I haven't used it before.

2347
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,240
Yes.

2348
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,360
Okay.

2349
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,230
As long as you're not unhappy.

2350
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,080
Maybe

2351
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,200
a sensitive girl.

2352
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,640
No.

2353
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,320
Anything else?

2354
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,200
Nothing.

2355
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,160
I'll sit with you.

2356
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,200
I'm fine with anything.

2357
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:05,560
I'm exhausted.

2358
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,840
I can only be your cousin.

2359
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,550
Anyway,

2360
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:08,560
let's talk alone.

2361
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,840
It's about the feelings.

2362
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,710
Text?

2363
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:13,470
Then you must follow your heart.

2364
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:13,950
right?

2365
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,440
Let me ask you.

2366
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,280
Don't tell me you won't contact anyone

2367
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,600
after sending this message?

2368
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,440
I will also contact others.

2369
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,440
This rule has a reasonable existence.

2370
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,120
It exists here.

2371
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:23,680
And this thing

2372
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,600
is not a love confession text.

2373
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,880
It's just a feeling.

2374
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,360
Right?

2375
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,640
It doesn't mean

2376
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,760
she doesn't like you.

2377
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,160
Yes.

2378
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,000
She didn't send it to me.

2379
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,600
but it doesn't mean she doesn't like me.

2380
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,430
There's a matter of which is more important.

2381
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:34,840
Fine.

2382
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,510
Since I know I'm light,

2383
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:37,360
I don't have to

2384
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,440
force others.

2385
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,150
I think it makes sense.

2386
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,200
And I personally think

2387
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,400
I'm already

2388
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,590
the one who takes the initiative.

2389
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,230
So I think

2390
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,960
you need to understand this fact.

2391
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,080
Do you understand?

2392
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,470
Or are you also confused?

2393
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:54,800
If she really has no feelings for you,

2394
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,800
she won't talk to you.

2395
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,150
Whether you're in a good mood or not,

2396
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:58,400
why did she ask me

2397
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,800
to tell you this,

2398
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:00,600
right?

2399
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,800
Did she not know

2400
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,760
she didn't know this would happen today.

2401
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,840
But in that environment,

2402
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:09,280
Do you know that feeling?

2403
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,680
The environment.

2404
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:13,120
So don't think about it.

2405
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,230
So you think

2406
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:15,840
I'm chatting with you.

2407
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,310
Am I struggling?

2408
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:18,360
I can tell you directly.

2409
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,550
I'm not struggling.

2410
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:20,720
I already have a choice.

2411
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,240
I don't understand.

2412
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,110
Maybe she really likes Terri.

2413
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:27,120
In my knowledge,

2414
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,120
I think she has made her choice today.

2415
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,240
But to be honest,

2416
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:33,680
I feel

2417
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:36,800
I don't dare to contact Xiaoling.

2418
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,120
I'm so scared.

2419
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,440
Their family is amazing.

2420
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,920
That's the feeling.

2421
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:43,840
I'm a postgraduate.

2422
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,910
And my mom is like that, right?

2423
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:50,000
That's why I'm shaken.

2424
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,280
You don't have to.

2425
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:52,990
I think

2426
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:54,080
to be swayed.

2427
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:54,960
Love is love

2428
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,800
Let's go.

2429
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:56,830
I told you.

2430
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:57,560
It's a reward.

2431
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,480
The return is the return.

2432
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,560
You can't give up just because there's a reward.

2433
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,840
Just love boldly.

2434
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,280
Susu.

2435
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,400
She's washing up.

2436
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,440
I heard you're angry.

2437
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,120
No.

2438
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,270
Why would I be angry?

2439
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:27,480
I heard you're angry.

2440
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:30,910
I'm going to cook.

2441
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:31,550
Let's talk after cooking.

2442
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:32,600
Put on makeup first.

2443
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:40,120
Apologize.

2444
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,680
I have nothing to say.

2445
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,390
I plan to cook her a meal

2446
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:44,880
and feed her well.

2447
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,360
Only when she's full can she talk to me

2448
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,710
At least you don't get up

2449
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,440
to communicate.

2450
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,800
What are you doing?

2451
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,080
Done

2452
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:55,550
What should I make

2453
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:56,880
I'll make a wonton.

2454
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,520
Today

2455
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,800
Are you going to cook flowers for us?

2456
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:00,080
Yes.

2457
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,280
Cook one for Ms. Hua.

2458
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,040
I watch her cook every day.

2459
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,150
It's so hard, flowers.

2460
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:06,590
Our flowers are so good.

2461
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,910
Make one for the map.

2462
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,080
Okay.

2463
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,840
Good people should be all-round.

2464
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,230
Who is like me?

2465
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,630
Not really.

2466
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,350
Good morning.

2467
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:21,560
Someone is making breakfast for you. Flowers.

2468
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,480
Really?

2469
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,760
Great.

2470
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:29,630
Do you want to put that?

2471
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:30,160
Sure.

2472
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,320
Try the original flavor.

2473
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,640
He made wontons this morning.

2474
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,240
Very light.

2475
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,040
It suits his taste.

2476
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,360
So I think

2477
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,840
he's trying to give me a good impression.

2478
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:48,990
Look, he's biased.

2479
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,400
Here you are.

2480
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,360
I took it myself.

2481
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,280
He didn't give it to me.

2482
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,280
In fact, he gave it to you in his heart.

2483
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:55,870
You're chosen.

2484
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:56,280
He wants to give it to you.

2485
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:56,600
Thank you.

2486
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,840
You're good at talking.

2487
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:05,880
What is this?

2488
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:06,720
Kimchi fried rice

2489
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:09,560
It's for my sister.

2490
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,590
Sister Ou did it.

2491
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:11,960
It's not a tower.

2492
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,830
Yes.

2493
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,910
It's not for him anyway.

2494
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,240
It's not for you.

2495
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,600
Yours is over there.

2496
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,480
I'm sorry.

2497
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,510
I knew it.

2498
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:21,790
To be honest, the soup

2499
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:23,360
I'm a bit arrogant.

2500
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,710
To be honest,

2501
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:24,320
Indeed.

2502
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,960
I thought there was me.

2503
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,200
I shouldn't have said anything

2504
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,360
and let you eat again.

2505
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,600
That's too dangerous.

2506
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,200
So scary.

2507
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,960
You dig a hole for me every day.

2508
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,200
The soup almost

2509
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,520
ate yours again.

2510
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,230
I stopped him.

2511
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,880
Hello.

2512
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,630
Come and eat.

2513
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,870
Eun-jo.

2514
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,200
I can't call her by her name anymore.

2515
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,280
I think she's older than me.

2516
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,120
Come on.

2517
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:55,070
Mi.

2518
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,350
What are you doing, Su Zihao?

2519
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:58,080
Do you know my name?

2520
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:58,880
What's my name?

2521
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,520
I know.

2522
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,120
I don't know either.

2523
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:00,990
Get lost!

2524
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:01,630
Me?

2525
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,480
Okay.

2526
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,440
Rolyn.

2527
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:05,950
Who asked you?

2528
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,670
My name is Lo Ling Kai.

2529
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,000
I'm also Louis.

2530
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,800
You still want to be her brother?

2531
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,400
Are you done?

2532
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:18,840
Let's go.

2533
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:19,960
Where are we going?

2534
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:20,880
Go upstairs with me.

2535
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:29,760
What?

2536
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,840
Nothing.

2537
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,390
Say it.

2538
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:32,160
Let me hear it.

2539
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:34,400
Don't...

2540
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,760
You're making me nervous.

2541
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,960
Don't be nervous.

2542
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,720
Nervous.

2543
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,120
Really nothing happened

2544
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,280
Nothing happened?

2545
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,150
Yes.

2546
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,800
Someone is here.

2547
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,320
No.

2548
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,640
I'm analyzing it for her.

2549
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:45,280
I heard that

2550
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,320
someone even showed her her text message.

2551
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,720
She asked me to show it to her.

2552
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,200
And

2553
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,480
She said she helped me analyze.

2554
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:54,040
HAVE.

2555
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:54,840
I found it before.

2556
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,640
What did you find?

2557
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,240
Something is wrong.

2558
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,080
When?

2559
01:45:58,270 --> 01:45:59,120
When you got in the car,

2560
01:45:59,120 --> 01:45:59,680
I found

2561
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:01,200
when I texted him,

2562
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,720
I was wondering what's wrong with him.

2563
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,790
I found it.

2564
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:15,320
You're really angry.

2565
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,670
You are indeed angry.

2566
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,320
No.

2567
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,150
It's okay.

2568
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:21,920
I just think

2569
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,870
I sent it too proactive.

2570
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:24,480
It's good.

2571
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:24,800
I like it.

2572
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,310
No.

2573
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,040
I like it.

2574
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:28,440
Not really.

2575
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,430
It's not because of the text.

2576
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,840
Then why?

2577
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,350
No.

2578
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:34,110
I think it's very complicated.

2579
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:36,160
Tell me how complicated it is.

2580
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,520
Maybe all kinds of things.

2581
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,280
You're just like me.

2582
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,800
You asked me yesterday

2583
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,520
what bothers you.

2584
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,750
What is it?

2585
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,640
Actually, I don't know.

2586
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,200
There are a lot of things

2587
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:45,880
which annoys me.

2588
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,270
Then he said,

2589
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,000
Tell me what it is.

2590
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,710
Then I said

2591
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,440
I have something to do.

2592
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,200
But I just

2593
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,000
It's annoying to add them together.

2594
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,030
Who?

2595
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:52,960
Who asked you?

2596
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,360
My buddy.

2597
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:55,390
Yes.

2598
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:56,510
Nothing happened.

2599
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:58,320
I don't know what's going on.

2600
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:02,360
What are you doing?

2601
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:07,960
Guolifang.

2602
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:10,910
Sorry.

2603
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,040
I'm sorry.

2604
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:15,680
Not really.

2605
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,560
Not really.

2606
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,560
I thought I was too proactive.

2607
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,360
Really?

2608
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,710
I think I'm licking it.

2609
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:24,960
Lick?

2610
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,720
Do you think...

2611
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,040
I don't know.

2612
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,280
Anyway,

2613
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,720
I can't feel the mood you texted.

2614
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,360
I think I am.

2615
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,600
You're too emotional.

2616
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,080
Yes.

2617
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:37,790
And you do this.

2618
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:38,960
No.

2619
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:39,680
Accident?

2620
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:42,270
No, don't.

2621
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:42,910
Accident.

2622
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:43,520
Nothing.

2623
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,400
Accident.

2624
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,040
People always make mistakes.

2625
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,320
Okay.

2626
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,280
I'll give you a chance.

2627
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:49,440
Give me a chance.

2628
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:52,830
Su Zihao.

2629
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:58,000
Su Zihao.

2630
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,360
Here.

2631
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,760
He won't let me talk.

2632
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,320
Hurry.

2633
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,750
Can you change your clothes first?

2634
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,120
Let's see what to wear together.

2635
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,870
Go.

2636
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:16,350
Go.

2637
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,840
Hurry up.

2638
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,240
Okay.

2639
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,440
I'm forced.

2640
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:27,550
Who knows?

2641
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,440
A letter came in.

2642
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,190
And the letters

2643
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,120
and letters.

2644
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:39,520
Come on.

2645
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:41,760
Hurry up.

2646
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,760
This is very exciting today.

2647
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,510
Very fun.

2648
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:45,120
Come on.

2649
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:46,360
I can only say

2650
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,080
this card is the most fun one.

2651
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,790
About brothers.

2652
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:51,480
Come on, sit down.

2653
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,920
We've made our relationship public.

2654
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,920
To let everyone know you better,

2655
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:01,150
tomorrow is your party.

2656
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,990
I feel like I'm going to perform this.

2657
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:05,360
Yes.

2658
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,000
Tomorrow is siblings' night.

2659
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,280
Please discuss it with your brothers.

2660
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,520
with your brothers.

2661
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,760
No.

2662
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,870
I look forward to your handsome appearance.

2663
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:17,040
There are more notes.

2664
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,160
Please make

2665
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,160
your own siblings.

2666
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,760
Do you have pink clothes?

2667
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,470
Okay.

2668
01:49:29,470 --> 01:49:31,200
You're wearing my pink pants.

2669
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:32,880
Do you want to embarrass me?

2670
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:33,200
No.

2671
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,270
It's funny when we walk.

2672
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:35,680
Can I wear this?

2673
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,150
It'll get stuck in the crotch.

2674
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,040
Try it.

2675
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,480
Or you can wear mine.

2676
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,670
This is pink.

2677
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:45,560
I'll leave it to you.

2678
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:51,230
What should I wear, Mr. Wang?

2679
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:52,400
Let me see your clothes first.

2680
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,310
I'll go with you.

2681
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:54,520
I'm going to wear

2682
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,600
a little bit educated.

2683
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,200
Because we are a girl group.

2684
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,240
You need to dance a little bit.

2685
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,200
Let's interact this time.

2686
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,360
In the first part,

2687
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,320
in the first part.

2688
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,440
and act.

2689
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,760
That kind of plot.

2690
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:09,080
Okay.

2691
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,560
Let's put down the microphone

2692
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,600
and dance together.

2693
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,080
You play here.

2694
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:21,520
No.

2695
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,270
Right hand.

2696
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,350
Okay.

2697
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,200
Ready, go.

2698
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Bro.

2699
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:38,520
It's impossible.

2700
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:41,040
It's impossible.

2701
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:45,240
Try again.

2702
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,160
I'll be cursed to death.

2703
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,040
You insulted the piano.

2704
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:49,520
Try again.

2705
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,080
Try again.

2706
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,800
Ready, go.

2707
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,000
Hello.

2708
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,600
What do you think?

2709
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,310
What do you think of

2710
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,360
What do you think?

2711
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,160
I think black and white are good.

2712
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,430
So you think it's not bad, right?

2713
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,710
Just add some accessories.

2714
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:12,600
That's all.

2715
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,280
Bye.

2716
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,200
What are you two doing?

2717
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,160
We were just chatting.

2718
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,600
What are you doing with Susu?

2719
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,320
Don't take our job.

2720
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,040
I want to know

2721
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,000
What are you doing?

2722
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,240
We... Then you...

2723
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,360
Awesome.

2724
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:27,200
Very greasy.

2725
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,080
What are you doing?

2726
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,200
We're ashamed.

2727
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:29,920
I don't want to say it.

2728
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:30,880
Dance "Northeast Love Story"?

2729
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,640
No.

2730
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,190
Really?

2731
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:32,830
No.

2732
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:34,270
Fatty can't do anything.

2733
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:35,480
Do you think I can?

2734
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:37,150
Then what will you do?

2735
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:38,270
I'll show her

2736
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:39,200
what a rugby game is.

2737
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,600
Knock her over.

2738
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,480
No, I have to ask Fatty.

2739
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:42,840
Okay.

2740
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,080
He's tired.

2741
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,960
The most embarrassing day.

2742
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,880
Really, I have to rap in my thirties.

2743
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,880
How can we piece together the future?

2744
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,880
Happiness is mine. No one can borrow it.

2745
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,760
Forget who I hate

2746
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,510
Who forgot to thank you?

2747
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,360
I think I should

2748
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,960
for 500 times.

2749
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,360
I think I can rap.

2750
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:06,960
I mean

2751
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,310
you're going to practice "Planet Fall".

2752
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:10,560
We only have half an hour.

2753
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,510
That's enough.

2754
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:14,640
We need to divide it.

2755
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,030
"Don't Guess" is easy.

2756
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:16,880
The rap part.

2757
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,720
I'll do it.

2758
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,680
Four sentences each.

2759
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:20,160
We need to adjust the atmosphere.

2760
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,200
Because we are rapping.

2761
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:22,200
Be funny.

2762
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,760
There's no funny part.

2763
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:24,510
How?

2764
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:25,310
I told you to adjust the atmosphere.

2765
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:26,520
She's so happy.

2766
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:26,840
Let's sing.

2767
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,800
They will be excited.

2768
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,920
What should we do?

2769
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,920
Why is it funny when someone plays the piano?

2770
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,960
This thing

2771
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,280
You can't force it.

2772
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,480
Mine should be funny.

2773
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,280
We need to adjust the atmosphere.

2774
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,200
I'd better be the one

2775
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,350
We can't be together.

2776
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:37,520
I can practice alone.

2777
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:39,160
Let me finish this first.

2778
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,600
Let's go.

2779
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,440
Stay close to each other.

2780
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:02,240
Once again announce to the world

2781
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:03,640
Don't pinch your throat on purpose.

2782
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,200
Just shout it out.

2783
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,270
But my voice cracked.

2784
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:07,640
Let me hear it.

2785
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,880
Announce all over the world

2786
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:15,200
I'll really die of embarrassment.

2787
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,160
Let me tell you.

2788
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,840
I want to wear a mask to perform.

2789
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,030
Kick away your worries secretly

2790
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,480
Get rid of?

2791
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,880
Do you want me to die?

2792
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,320
No.

2793
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,680
Whose heartbeat is it?

2794
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,120
It's screaming.

2795
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,750
There, thump thump.

2796
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:36,400
Use this.

2797
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,440
I quit.

2798
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,040
I wish you happiness every day.

2799
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,280
Cherish it.

2800
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,240
Now the romantic trip

2801
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,360
in the house

2802
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,600
Find your true love.

2803
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,390
Come on, soup.

2804
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,990
I beg you.

2805
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,840
I said, come up here.

2806
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,480
I have something to tell you.

2807
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,400
Crazy.

2808
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,200
Dates are automatically.

2809
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:16,600
or random?

2810
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,400
I don't know.

2811
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,750
Actually, I didn't know

2812
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:20,240
everyone in the house.

2813
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,720
Me too.

2814
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,720
Have you had a date with Xinxin?

2815
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,230
No.

2816
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:30,640
I only have one date with Susu and Hua.

2817
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,240
That's not a date.

2818
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,520
I'm always with Harry anyway.

2819
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,190
So if you have a chance in the future,

2820
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:39,870
if you have a chance next time?

2821
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:41,600
I don't know.

2822
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,680
I don't think so.

2823
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,920
I may be passive.

2824
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,160
Let's see if you want to ask me out.

2825
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:50,880
Okay.

2826
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,120
Sure.

2827
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,120
I'll ask you out with Harry.

2828
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:53,720
Who will you choose?

2829
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,120
So bad.

2830
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,680
Answer me.

2831
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,510
He must be under pressure.

2832
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:02,110
Although you're a fake brother,

2833
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,640
he was nice to me.

2834
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,720
I still don't know

2835
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,840
who sent me

2836
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,200
on the first day?

2837
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,440
Five boys.

2838
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,840
I'll get rid of them first, right?

2839
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,600
Harry too

2840
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:13,880
And the soup.

2841
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:16,720
It can only be fat or map.

2842
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,360
I think it's probably a map.

2843
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,800
But the map...

2844
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:20,830
When we texted,

2845
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:22,520
the map didn't come back.

2846
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,000
I think there should be ten people.

2847
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,600
when all ten people are here.

2848
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,270
So do you think it should be a map?

2849
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:27,640
I think it's probably a map.

2850
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,350
Go back and ask.

2851
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:29,310
and ask around.

2852
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:31,960
In reality,

2853
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,200
you don't have such emotional ups and downs.

2854
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,230
It's also rare.

2855
01:55:35,230 --> 01:55:36,510
Yes, very rare.

2856
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:37,720
you won't text you

2857
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,200
because of a girl?

2858
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,400
Why are you so angry?

2859
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,110
I don't think it's bad.

2860
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:42,750
I think so too.

2861
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:45,150
I've been in love for years

2862
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:46,160
for years.

2863
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:46,880
Yes.

2864
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:49,400
How long has it been since I had such ups and downs?

2865
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,160
To be honest,

2866
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:51,390
Yes.

2867
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:53,680
Up.

2868
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,320
This is love.

2869
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:54,080
What do you want to draw?

2870
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,440
Pick a color.

2871
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,840
I'll draw one.

2872
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,480
I want blue.

2873
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:00,350
Okay, I'll draw an egg tart.

2874
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:01,200
I drew two hearts.

2875
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,000
Okay.

2876
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,870
Tae-seo.

2877
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:08,720
Can I sign this?

2878
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,240
Yes.

2879
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,160
Okay.

2880
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,790
You sit inside and I'll sit outside.

2881
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,520
Good evening.

2882
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,760
Good evening.

2883
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,080
Let's sign the center.

2884
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,710
Hua.

2885
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:45,470
Stay next to me.

2886
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:48,440
Sure.

2887
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,600
What do you want to draw?

2888
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,390
I'll draw a big ear picture.

2889
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:54,520
Okay, it's done.

2890
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,150
Hold my hand.

2891
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:59,000
Okay.

2892
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:07,360
So cute.

2893
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,280
Cute.

2894
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,280
We're the center.

2895
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,520
OK.

2896
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,000
We'll invite you later.

2897
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,200
Who will be the next group?

2898
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,080
Take a guess.

2899
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,800
Maybe it's Fatty.

2900
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,920
I guess it's Fatty Xinxin.

2901
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,880
It sounds like Susu.

2902
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,360
Good evening.

2903
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:48,600
Done.

2904
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,310
Your hand...

2905
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,590
Good evening.

2906
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,990
I'm fine. Thank you.

2907
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:18,270
Soup looks like a foreigner wearing a suit

2908
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,960
You're wearing a Chinese uniform?

2909
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,790
Yes, just like that.

2910
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:24,000
His clothes are very nice today.

2911
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,400
I feel like a little prince.

2912
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,960
Like a nobleman.

2913
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,270
I can't draw.

2914
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:36,350
It's colorless.

2915
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:37,880
Bro, you're a little rash.

2916
01:59:39,870 --> 01:59:41,310
Xiao Ling is good at drawing.

2917
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:42,910
I heard someone praising me.

2918
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,400
You wrote my name for me.

2919
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,200
Aren't we too slow?

2920
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,910
Okay, good.

2921
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,400
Your handwriting is ugly.

2922
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,520
Thank you.

2923
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,590
Why did you draw a head like me?

2924
02:00:06,590 --> 02:00:07,640
I didn't draw it.

2925
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,440
I drew it.

2926
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,000
Did you draw the head?

2927
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,750
The one with big ears.

2928
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,240
I thought it was a balloon.

2929
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:15,710
You are the "Biography of the Triple Calendar".

2930
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,640
I’m 4 Mao.

2931
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:24,510
Long time no see.

2932
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:35,440
This way.

2933
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:39,320
Why do you want green?

2934
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,670
This is yellow.

2935
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:52,990
Sit inside.

2936
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,440
I want to be the first.

2937
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:00,160
You want to be the first?

2938
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,040
Who wants to be the first?

2939
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:01,790
Sure.

2940
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:04,880
No.

2941
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,840
So awkward.

2942
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,160
We were a bit

2943
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,950
Because the first one has no pressure.

2944
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:10,720
The first one has no pressure.

2945
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:11,840
I was too stressed.

2946
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,600
Don't worry.

2947
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:15,680
Don't be afraid.

2948
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,310
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

2949
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:17,840
Don't be afraid.

2950
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,520
Hua.

2951
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,920
Wang siblings.

2952
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,840
Wang siblings.

2953
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,150
We are siblings of the Luo family.

2954
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:38,720
Why can't it be the Yuan family?

2955
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,080
Anything is fine.

2956
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,120
We brought two songs.

2957
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:46,360
One is singing.

2958
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:47,710
and the other is singing and dancing.

2959
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,110
So you want to see singing and dancing first

2960
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:50,840
or first?

2961
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:51,960
Singing and dancing.

2962
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,310
Singing and dancing, OK?

2963
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:54,880
Singing and dancing.

2964
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,600
Let's interact more later, okay?

2965
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,520
Don't make us too embarrassed.

2966
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,480
Let's warm up the stage.

2967
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:08,640
Music.

2968
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,560
Full of vitality.

2969
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:17,040
YES! OK!

2970
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:22,110
Yes! OK!

2971
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:40,720
The flowers are beautiful.

2972
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:42,240
Thank you.

2973
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:43,230
So cute.

2974
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,080
Let's get high.

2975
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,190
It's really a great opening.

2976
02:03:56,190 --> 02:03:57,880
When Hua was performing on stage,

2977
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,040
she was very confident.

2978
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,280
Be confident and shine.

2979
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:02,910
His singing is really good.

2980
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:04,480
The two of them

2981
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,920
are always happy.

2982
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,840
Their singing and dancing will be fine.

2983
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:08,990
It's really great.

2984
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:14,840
Next is our BBQ.

2985
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:15,550
Yes.

2986
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:37,630
I think our performance

2987
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:39,640
perfect teamwork.

2988
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:42,680
Brothers' Night makes me very happy.

2989
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:43,680
Because as a

2990
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,080
the atmosphere,

2991
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,480
Not only did I sing,

2992
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,440
I also performed a show.

2993
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,320
and danced.

2994
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:50,800
I think he can give us

2995
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:51,710
100 points.

2996
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:52,990
First of all, we're brave enough

2997
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:54,320
is commendable.

2998
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:54,800
Yes.

2999
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:57,240
And during the performance,

3000
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:58,400
we also heard a lot of applause.

3001
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:01,120
The picture is so cool.

3002
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:02,880
The kind of singing and dancing.

3003
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:05,950
Passion and liveliness can touch me.

3004
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:08,320
With so many songs together,

3005
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,680
He remembers the moves.

3006
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,800
He can even sing it.

3007
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:14,520
Drawing.

3008
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,720
When dancing,

3009
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:17,920
when dancing.

3010
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,320
Let me see

3011
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,200
I've never seen before.

3012
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:25,200
Thank you.

3013
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:27,960
Awesome!

3014
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:28,880
So strong.

3015
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:31,120
I'm really panicking now.

3016
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:31,920
I'm under a lot of pressure.

3017
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:32,920
Too much pressure.

3018
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,950
My toes are really stingy.

3019
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,910
What should I do?

3020
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:39,800
I don't know.

3021
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,560
It must be stressful.

3022
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,160
We'll only be beautiful.

3023
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:46,960
Oh no, I want to go home.

3024
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:51,320
We just play

3025
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:53,760
"The River of Heart".

3026
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,680
Okay.

3027
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:00,440
So elegant

3028
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,080
My four hands are playing together.

3029
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,000
We didn't have enough time to practice.

3030
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,800
We just cooperated in a mess.

3031
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:27,600
Come on.

3032
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:28,990
I'm still a little nervous.

3033
02:07:28,990 --> 02:07:30,360
I made a little mistake.

3034
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:31,600
But the overall effect

3035
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:32,510
is not bad.

3036
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:34,720
I think it's good to be happy.

3037
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:36,510
It's good.

3038
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,080
It's so nice.

3039
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,640
Beautiful.

3040
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,710
We have

3041
02:07:43,710 --> 02:07:45,470
One has a single song.

3042
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:47,920
They are well prepared.

3043
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,080
This song is more fun.

3044
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:50,590
Okay.

3045
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:51,000
Okay.

3046
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,200
Is she a princess?

3047
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,750
Xiao Ling is so elegant.

3048
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:21,840
She doesn't look like us.

3049
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,120
He's performing for us.

3050
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:27,440
It's beautiful sitting there.

3051
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,720
It's just a poster.

3052
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:31,800
I'm looking at their handsome and beautiful side.

3053
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:43,160
I can tell she's a princess.

3054
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,160
Mimi is great.

3055
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,080
Thank you, Sunny.

3056
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:50,400
The prince is here

3057
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,200
Prince.

3058
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,920
Love.

3059
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,000
Did he practice it?

3060
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:02,840
He practiced it for me alone.

3061
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:03,710
Not this.

3062
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:29,520
When he plays the soup,

3063
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,520
he's also charming.

3064
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:32,830
It's a bonus.

3065
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:40,830
Tom!

3066
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:42,800
I love you.

3067
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,480
Prince of Depression.

3068
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,560
My restless heart

3069
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,440
I calmed down.

3070
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:50,110
Really.

3071
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:51,960
I'm so stressed.

3072
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:52,600
You know?

3073
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,120
I'm going to faint.

3074
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,440
My stomach hurts.

3075
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,110
During the rehearsal,

3076
02:09:58,110 --> 02:09:59,120
I sang better.

3077
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,360
I'm basically confused now.

3078
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:05,440
Xinxin.

3079
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,680
I'm nervous.

3080
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:07,870
It's okay.

3081
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:09,720
The moment I got the microphone,

3082
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,680
my hands were stiff.

3083
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:13,720
I can't move my legs.

3084
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:15,960
Let's sing "Planet Fall".

3085
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,680
I'm more nervous now.

3086
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:19,640
Who knows?

3087
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,950
Both of you are rappers.

3088
02:10:21,950 --> 02:10:23,390
I'm responsible for "Zhai Xinxin".

3089
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:25,280
You want to give me the stars?

3090
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:25,680
This.

3091
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:26,160
This is it.

3092
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,760
Come on.

3093
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,640
Can you dance with me?

3094
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,680
Train Iron Palm.

3095
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,560
Really, I was going to say

3096
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:23,640
Xinxin.

3097
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:24,830
Fatty.

3098
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,280
Xin, Fatty.

3099
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,200
Try your best.

3100
02:11:46,590 --> 02:11:47,960
I'm so nervous.

3101
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,710
I thought it through.

3102
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:53,440
to interact with you.

3103
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:54,720
We talked and laughed.

3104
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:56,080
and rhythm.

3105
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,400
and rhythm.

3106
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,680
We look at each other.

3107
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:00,350
No.

3108
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:01,840
Nothing.

3109
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,640
She's more nervous than me.

3110
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:05,630
I didn't expect that.

3111
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:07,070
He didn't even move.

3112
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:08,510
I was going to have some interaction

3113
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:09,600
I didn't dare to move at all.

3114
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:11,200
I kept staring at the screen.

3115
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:12,800
Hurry up.

3116
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,630
Finish it quickly.

3117
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,390
Xinxin.

3118
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,240
Fatty.

3119
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:17,120
Xinxin.

3120
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,040
Have fun.

3121
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:19,840
What?

3122
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:22,750
Brothers and sisters.

3123
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:23,840
I dare not go on.

3124
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,470
I dare not.

3125
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:26,720
Who knows what ice cellar is?

3126
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,030
This is an ice cellar.

3127
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:28,830
I need to change later.

3128
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:31,230
Somebody help me

3129
02:12:31,230 --> 02:12:32,190
Somebody help me

3130
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,160
I'm so nervous.

3131
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:35,120
You're too nervous.

3132
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,360
I swallowed all the words.

3133
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,430
I'm so embarrassed.

3134
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:39,600
Not at all.

3135
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:41,790
Applaud for you like iron clap.

3136
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:42,800
Really.

3137
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:43,390
I love you.

3138
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,440
Okay.

3139
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:51,160
Don't forget the movements.

3140
02:12:51,550 --> 02:12:52,350
Move.

3141
02:12:52,350 --> 02:12:53,720
Not now.

3142
02:12:54,430 --> 02:12:55,550
I want to stand out, you know?

3143
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,960
I want a sprayer now.

3144
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,030
We were both nervous before the performance.

3145
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:02,270
I was still reading the lyrics.

3146
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:03,520
and thinking about the movements.

3147
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,270
Harry is him.

3148
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:08,400
My hands are cold and sweating.

3149
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,720
It's actually warm in the arena.

3150
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,920
But he kept sweating.

3151
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,560
Maybe it's because of him.

3152
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,840
a man who has a crush on him.

3153
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:15,870
he gets more nervous.

3154
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:16,880
Who knows?

3155
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,440
So handsome and beautiful.

3156
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:24,560
They're talking about the talk show.

3157
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:25,760
The hat is fine.

3158
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:36,670
We're going to perform a song.

3159
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:39,960
and micro gesture dance.

3160
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,200
Please forgive me.

3161
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:44,960
Okay.

3162
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:52,640
The DNA moved.

3163
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:59,040
It's like your singing style.

3164
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:35,160
Harry's outfit

3165
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,560
I think it's very cute.

3166
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,430
That suit and hat

3167
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:40,030
are all his sister's.

3168
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:41,150
I think it's cute.

3169
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:42,590
It's funny.

3170
02:14:42,590 --> 02:14:44,480
Harry is wearing

3171
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,750
a white cow.

3172
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,440
Susu looks handsome.

3173
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,550
Black and white.

3174
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:54,840
It's like a stage performance.

3175
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:58,800
I think their costumes impressed me.

3176
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:11,840
Who knows?

3177
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,040
We need to add some movements.

3178
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:13,600
Harry.

3179
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,480
Who knows?

3180
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,680
Why do you do this?

3181
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:20,160
Sing it again.

3182
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,070
OK. Here comes the king.

3183
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:25,310
Come on.

3184
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:26,270
Nervous.

3185
02:15:26,270 --> 02:15:27,280
So stressed.

3186
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,160
So nervous.

3187
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:29,920
Supermodel

3188
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,000
You've got full marks.

3189
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,560
Are you two standing up there?

3190
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,000
Five minutes.

3191
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,280
Tarri and I will do a show together.

3192
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,400
And...

3193
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,000
I'll invite you

3194
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,520
with us.

3195
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,960
Please cooperate.

3196
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,390
No.

3197
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,590
I didn't even expect that.

3198
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:48,030
Yes, you can do it.

3199
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:49,880
Good luck.

3200
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:50,430
Okay.

3201
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:29,470
Tata's eyes will change soon.

3202
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:38,110
Tata.

3203
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:40,000
Is this the tower next to me?

3204
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:09,040
We're stuck.

3205
02:17:11,070 --> 02:17:13,920
Get ready to go with us.

3206
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:15,549
Let's go together.

3207
02:17:15,549 --> 02:17:16,600
Fatty, come with me.

3208
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,360
Get up.

3209
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:18,680
Susu, get up.

3210
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:20,830
Get up.

3211
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,520
Okay, let's go.

3212
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,480
Let's take a detour.

3213
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,799
Let's take a detour.

3214
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:26,320
Pants?

3215
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,670
Really? We look like clowns.

3216
02:17:29,629 --> 02:17:31,280
It's not like a fashion show.

3217
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:34,680
Walk a few laps.

3218
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:38,240
Throw the handkerchief.

3219
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:38,559
Throw the handkerchief.

3220
02:17:39,799 --> 02:17:41,080
Okay.

3221
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,520
Please take your seats.

3222
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,920
Thank you.

3223
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:56,670
Seeing Tata's performance today,

3224
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:59,520
As expected from a professional.

3225
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,400
She should shine so brightly.

3226
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:04,440
If I tell you how I feel,

3227
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:05,080
Tata is always

3228
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,480
in my heart.

3229
02:18:07,639 --> 02:18:10,080
Tata and Tarri are really like that.

3230
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,360
are totally out.

3231
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,520
It's totally different

3232
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:15,549
It's totally different

3233
02:18:15,549 --> 02:18:18,080
Terri is cool and cool.

3234
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,510
Tata is totally different

3235
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:21,559
is totally different.

3236
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:22,799
That kind of cat outfit.

3237
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:24,190
I feel

3238
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,200
I got goose bumps.

3239
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,160
It's very eye-catching.

3240
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:30,400
I've never seen them go on a show before.

3241
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,870
Not only did they go on a show,

3242
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:33,360
they also took us to the show.

3243
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:34,840
The atmosphere was really good.

3244
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,400
It made us all happy.

3245
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,600
into it.

3246
02:18:39,549 --> 02:18:40,670
Amazing.

3247
02:18:40,670 --> 02:18:41,559
Because in my eyes,

3248
02:18:41,559 --> 02:18:42,480
is a little girl.

3249
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,360
kind

3250
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:44,400
and spoiled by her family.

3251
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:46,719
When she went on stage, her temperament changed.

3252
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,840
I feel like I can see her other side.

3253
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:52,190
This is a huge contrast.

3254
02:18:53,719 --> 02:18:55,480
For me and Tata,

3255
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,719
this is a piece of cake.

3256
02:18:57,719 --> 02:19:00,030
Because we've all been to a bigger TV station.

3257
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:03,440
Tata and I are quite confident.

3258
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:06,910
The whole process went well.

3259
02:19:07,709 --> 02:19:08,959
Let's have a toast.

3260
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:09,790
Come on.

3261
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:11,160
Cheers.

3262
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:12,400
The first party.

3263
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,320
Cheers.

3264
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:22,110
There's a text message.

3265
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,440
I can't edit my own.

3266
02:19:32,719 --> 02:19:34,320
I can't name the soup.

3267
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:57,560
I voted for Terri and Tata.

3268
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,520
The model is very cool.

3269
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,280
I feel like this.

3270
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,960
Then they pulled us up

3271
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,120
and interacted.

3272
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:05,200
This is something I didn't expect.

3273
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,120
I think we can play like this.

3274
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:09,280
So I think it's very memorable.

3275
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:10,400
I remember the model step.

3276
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:11,560
So I voted for them.

3277
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,440
Why did you choose Terri and Tata?

3278
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:17,920
Because it’s related to my training.

3279
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:20,800
I think whoever performs better

3280
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:21,920
I will vote for.

3281
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,440
I vote for Xinxin and Fatty.

3282
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:27,440
Because other people

3283
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:30,000
our major is

3284
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,440
to show themselves.

3285
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:33,640
They can stand in front of so many people

3286
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:34,880
in front of so many people.

3287
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:35,560
and rap.

3288
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:36,720
I think he's very brave.

3289
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,760
I voted for Tata and Terri.

3290
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:44,280
It's so cool.

3291
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:46,200
It's rare to see such a performance.

3292
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:53,920
I voted

3293
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:56,000
the best performance partner.

3294
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:56,640
Because I think

3295
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:59,400
she and Tu

3296
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,600
The passion and liveliness can touch me.

3297
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:06,360
I voted for soup and Xiaoling.

3298
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,360
Maybe I'm selfish.

3299
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:12,000
I choose soup.

3300
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,480
I think they did a good job.

3301
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,480
I voted for Hua's team.

3302
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:24,320
Because they sang and danced.

3303
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:25,200
I think they're great.

3304
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:46,640
So sudden. Why?

3305
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,040
Model group.

3306
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,440
Really?

3307
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:50,840
I thought we had zero votes.

3308
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,840
Me too.

3309
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,040
Amazing.

3310
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:56,280
Let's get straight to the point.

3311
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:58,040
I'm the one being treated differently.

3312
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,000
Why should I change myself

3313
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:00,840
because of this?

3314
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:01,480
I can't do it.

3315
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:02,520
You don't need to stress.

3316
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:03,520
Do you want to hear me out?

3317
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,280
I can't accept this explanation.

3318
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,120
But what you said and did

3319
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:06,880
are different.

3320
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,600
No.

3321
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:08,880
Yes.

3322
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:09,400
Make it clear.

3323
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:10,040
Okay.

3324
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:10,520
I'm sorry.

3325
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:11,280
I apologize for this.

3326
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:13,280
Just say it if you want to.

3327
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,560
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

3328
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,760
I hope this day will come for you.

3329
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,840
Forget it.

3330
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,920
Whether I go or not is in my hands.

3331
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:29,680
I want to go on a date.

3332
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:32,560
Okay, you try.

3333
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:33,600
I'll try too.

3334
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,680
to see who will get it.

3335
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:49,120

3341
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:21,560
"Love Siblings" has been searched hundreds of times. It's all about Baidu Baidu.

3342
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:41,760
I'm from the neighboring China, Beijing Yanqing Resort Village. and enjoy the French vacation in the suburbs.
