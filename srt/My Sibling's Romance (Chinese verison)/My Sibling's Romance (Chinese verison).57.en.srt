1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Because you didn't receive the text,

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,400
so I made you breakfast, right?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,920
Yes.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,320
This is the first time you made breakfast for me.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Are you holding my hand?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,080
Don't make me angry.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,200
I thought you were going to write something.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
This song should go with those two.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
Let's welcome our sweet couple

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,120
to our scene.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,000
We brought you sweets.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,080
I don't know

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,320
is like.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,920
Let me analyze it.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,040
Share it.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,440
after the recording.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,960
What did you do?

18
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,440
Mi-shim.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,360
National College.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:19,680
Shu Qiu.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,080
Love Sisters

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
Double love.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,120
and intervene in love and social therapy.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,000
"Love Sisters".

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,240
We're lovers' family members.

26
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,880
We're going to

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,960
of this episode.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Hua.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,360
Come here.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,600
I want to talk to you.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
I still want to ask

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
Do you think our relationship

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,759
be affected?

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
because you think

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,479
I'm not passionate enough with you.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
I didn't say I neglected you these days.

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
I want to say

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,400
we can talk about

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,440
about us later.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,160
You must be busy these days.

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,320
You must be worried about your feelings too.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
I don't know

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
about our relationship.

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,079
After all, your relationship with Fatty

46
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,040
he may be close to you

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,440
and close.

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Maybe this change

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,520
So I didn't know

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,640
how to

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
completely

52
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
and get along with you.

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
I want to tell myself

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't want to know.

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,240
I think this is right.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,960
But after Fatty approached me,

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,880
after he touched me.

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,000
and come back to me.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
I went around the same circle with Tae-seo.

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
Come to me.

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,680
To me,

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
to me.

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,800
I just talked to Fatty.

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,880
In my heart,

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,040
in my heart.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,520
He said

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,240
he respected me to get along with you.

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm a person

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,079
think a lot.

70
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,000
Because I think

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,440
in this atmosphere,

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
in this atmosphere.

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,640
But for friendship,

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,320
I hope I can

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
My sister.

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,760
I wanted to hug you.

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
Why are you so pretty today?

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,160
You lie to me every day.

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
I haven't said it for two days.

80
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
I've been distant from you.

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
That's why I didn't tell you.

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,760
You're so pretty today.

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,880
I think

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,800
a girl's friendship

85
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,280
is worth my 100% effort.

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,160
Of course,

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm sure of something.

88
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,720
Then I'll try it.

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,200
I hope I can

90
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,320
make you feel that I'm sincere.

91
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,160
I think when we are

92
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,600
too sensitive,

93
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
It's awkward time.

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,560
It's awkward.

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,280
to friendship

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
to this day.

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,360
There are many things

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,160
in private.

99
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,960
There are

100
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,520
For example,

101
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
your facial expressions

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
or my movements

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
make you feel there might be some misunderstanding.

104
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
I think...

105
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,480
I think it's okay.

106
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm willing to find you.

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm willing to

108
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,160
with you.

109
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
A while ago,

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
when I didn't receive your message,

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,560
I wasn't upset at all.

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
I told my friend

113
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,600
I said, "So what?"

114
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,320
I made friends here.

115
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I think I really like Xinxin.

116
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,680
Xinxin and I are good friends.

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
In the next two days,

118
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,720
I misunderstood.

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,200
Then I told Fatty

120
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,680
I said,

121
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,920
It's better if you don't like her.

122
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,560
I told you it was complicated.

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,200
You know?

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,120
I said,

125
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,840
I think

126
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,360
we would be purer.

127
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
We might talk more.

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,600
And you may be more willing to share

129
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,120
with me.

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes.

131
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Even my feelings

132
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,880
my feelings.

133
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,159
And I blamed him.

134
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,080
I said it was all your fault.

135
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
Are you done now?

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
You're so clingy.

137
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,200
You're always like this.

138
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
So scary.

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,159
It's the same for me when I'm in a relationship.

140
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,120
I want to kiss you 800 times a day.

141
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
Seriously.

142
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,200
I haven't put it on for days.

143
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,040
I haven't even gone to your bed.

144
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,760
You scary Gemini.

145
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,880
Flower is

146
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,440
who likes to touch me.

147
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,720
who likes to touch me.

148
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
I feel

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,440
I was needed.

150
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,000
So I'm very happy.

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
I'm grateful that she came to me.

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Actually our relationship

153
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,480
has become quite good.

154
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm happy to have such a change.

155
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,920
Yes.

156
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,400
She even cried for me.

157
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
Go down and write your diary.

158
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,640
Tonight, when you answer those questions

159
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,800
in front of everyone,

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
I thought you didn't like me.

161
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
You're just answering questions.

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
There's no emotion or emotion.

163
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
Didn't you say it's cooked?

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
Anyway, Yinbo, you eat first.

165
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840
Really?

166
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,000
Then one less confessing tomorrow.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm afraid Yinbo will confess.

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
I'll poison him to death today.

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,560
How is it?

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm leaving.

171
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
How does it feel?

172
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,720
I want to cry.

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
I don't want to leave Bobo.

174
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,800
Come to Shanghai.

175
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,640
Come to Shanghai.

176
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm here to pick you up.

177
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,760
Come on.

178
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,480
Three, two, one.

179
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,560
Cherish the last meal.

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,760
The last dinner.

181
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't say that.

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Do you think our friendship

183
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,240
our friendship

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
change our friendship

185
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840
because of fat?

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
I think you are influenced.

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
I'm not affected.

188
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,080
Okay.

189
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
I think I'm fine.

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
I care about this.

191
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
Tell her to come tomorrow.

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,960
What are you doing?

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,720
I want to see my sister.

194
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Yes.

195
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
What do you want to tell her when you see her?

196
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
Sister.

197
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,240
Yuan Bo is really a good boy.

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,560
He posts good people cards when he sees him.

199
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,600
Yes.

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
I feel like I have to see him every month.

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,600
and every month

202
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
or every month.

203
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,320
You don't have to ask.

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,480
Who asked?

205
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
He was in a hurry.

206
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,360
I have to ask him more accurately.

207
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
Actually,

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,920
I can't make any decision for you.

209
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
But in my opinion,

210
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,680
he doesn't deserve your love.

211
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm Soup.

212
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm Xiaoling.

213
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,120
I called Xiaoling here.

214
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm now

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
a tool now.

216
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,240
Help me

217
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,640
for Susu.

218
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Yes.

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,280
The next day.

220
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
The last day.

221
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,120
(Confession Day)

222
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:32,160
Time for the brothers' diary.

223
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,840
I feel like yesterday.

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,560
What did I write?

225
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,680
I feel better than yesterday.

226
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm not that exhausted.

227
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,040
You asked me what I thought.

228
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
We were talking in the siblings' house.

229
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,160
The brothers' diary exchange time.

230
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,200
I can be more calm and rational
The brothers' diary exchange time.

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,640
I can be more calm and rational

232
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
more rationally.

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
no matter what happens in the end,

234
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
I'll be by his side.

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
So I hope he can take his time.

236
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,680
There's nothing to be afraid of.

237
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
I wrote it.

238
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Can you stop

239
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,480
at such a emotional moment?

240
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,720
This is me.

241
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,040
Okay.

242
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,480
Are you feeling sad these days?

243
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,360
Maybe a few days ago.

244
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
You said you're sorry.

245
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
I don't want to write it today.

246
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,440
But I think your date with Tu is going well.

247
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm happy for you.

248
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,080
I think he's your type.

249
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,800
Really?

250
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
I think

251
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
I cried for Fatty.

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,240
I really wanted to choose Fatty.

253
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,800
But I thought about it for a long time.

254
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,760
I think you and Fatty

255
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
have been to a sports day.

256
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,280
You'll have a better choice

257
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,560
you'll have a better choice.

258
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,080
The first time I asked you

259
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,680
if you would choose

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,440
On the night of our first day (siblings' house)

261
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,800
Yeah, you said so too.

262
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm not satisfied with

263
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm not satisfied with the answer.

264
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
But I also chose the drawing.

265
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
Take a look.

266
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,960
What did I write?

267
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,640
You wrote Eagle Hunting Chicken.

268
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,680
Time exchange for brothers' diary.

269
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
Time for the brothers' diary.

270
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Hug me.

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
Hug together.

272
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Why are our content so different?

273
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Why is my handwriting so much better than yours?

274
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
You're pretty.

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,120
I don't want to see it.

276
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,680
What's wrong?

277
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm going to cry again.

278
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,640
Don't cry.

279
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Your makeup is messed up.

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,400
No one will do it for you.

281
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
I don't know how to make up.

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,760
I'll draw you a pretty face.

283
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
That day,

284
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,000
It was me.

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
The day we went to the cat cafe.

286
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,480
Why?

287
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,920
Why?

288
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,400
How could she...

289
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,360
How could she do this to you?

290
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes.

291
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,480
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

292
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,520
I want to cry even more.
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

293
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,040
I want to cry even more.

294
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,240
Why did you mention this too?

295
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
You can't do it.

296
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
Last time we had a good chat

297
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,920
before I became an adult.

298
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I think so.

299
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
Why is it so hard?

300
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,120
Because your weight will be bigger.

301
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,640
so your butt will be hurt.

302
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,800
Please copy it 100 times.

303
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,240
And chant it 100 times every day.

304
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,560
What is it?

305
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,320
I've always had

306
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,920
is always mine.

307
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll copy it when I think of it.

308
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
What?

309
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,240
I thought you were going to write something.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,640
You deserve better

311
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
and love you more.

312
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
Tom and I

313
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,560
between Tom and me.

314
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,840
He has indeed changed.

315
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,440
I cried for him.

316
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,040
He cried for me.

317
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,880
This is

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
I remember.

319
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
We're closer than before.

320
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
I want to be someone who cares about your feelings.

321
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
I want to take care of you.

322
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,360
(Diaries for Time Exchange)

323
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120

324
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,160
I said I'll keep an eye on him.

I said I'll keep an eye on him.

326
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Don't take the initiative

327
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,800
don't take the initiative.

328
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,040
Follow your heart.

329
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Don't be influenced by others.

330
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,440
If both of you

331
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
take the initiative,

332
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
It'll be better.

333
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,040
There are many misunderstandings

334
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,200
including being angry.

335
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,080
they don't say what they think.

336
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
That's why it's a misunderstanding.

337
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,920
From a brother's point of view,

338
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,640
I think you are suitable for each other.

339
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,520
For example,

340
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,200
If you like it,

341
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,880
just go ahead.

342
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
Because for you,

343
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
if distance

344
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,920
is not a big problem,

345
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
As long as you spend time,

346
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,840
you'll get along well.

347
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,720
That's all.

348
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,960
and read yours.

349
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,160
After reading yours,

350
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,720
I think I wrote it very well.

351
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,600
What do you mean thank you for your emergency call last night?

352
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,480
I feel it.

353
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,280
Emergency call.

354
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
You called me.

355
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,800
You said I was doomed.

356
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,080
Why is the soup unhappy?

357
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,280
What's wrong with you?

358
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,720
What?

359
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,360
I think it's because I said Brother Tata is handsome.

360
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,120
That time.

361
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,800
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

362
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
I just want to talk to you.

363
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,880
The soup is very angry.

364
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,320
Very angry

365
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
Why?

366
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,840
And why?

367
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
It's because of you.

368
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,240
Why?

369
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Because I praised Tata's brother.

370
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,880
I don't know.

371
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,480
I think so.

372
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
I don't know.

373
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
Time for the brothers' diary.

374
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
I've been wandering around the door several times.

375
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,080
Yes.

376
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
Are you holding the hand?

377
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,680
Your Chinese is good.

378
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,200
or my Chinese?

379
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,920
Let me see.

380
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,640
What do you mean?

381
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,240
That's the other half.

382
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Are you crazy?

383
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
Don't make me angry.

384
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,840
I feel these two days passed so quickly.

385
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
In the blink of an eye, I went back to my house.

386
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
But when I read it, I feel a little depressed now.

387
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,960
So I went back to my room.

388
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Although we haven't seen each other much,

389
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
A little bit.

390
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,200
But coincidentally,

391
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
I still have to read it.

392
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,240
But coincidentally,

393
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,640
we share a room

394
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,760
to a room.

395
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I really want to laugh when I read this.

396
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,440
Besides,

397
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
But I'm not in your three photos.

398
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,440
I won't forgive you.

399
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
My sister is not in these three.

400
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
I don't want to talk to you.

401
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,240
I don't want to talk to you every day.

402
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,440
I'm speechless.

403
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,160
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

404
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,840
Have a seat.

405
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,880
This diary...

406
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
Because of your letter,

407
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
broke my guard.

408
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,520
Why?

409
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,160
She wrote so sentimental.

410
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
So I wrote this diary very carefully.

411
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,520
I really didn't know how to write it at the beginning.

412
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,160
to the end.

413
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Take a look.

414
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,280
I wrote it so long.

415
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
Really?

416
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
Yes.

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
Let me see.

418
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,360
It's very boring.

419
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,400
Should I tear it off?

420
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,640
I must take revenge for that day.

421
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,600
You made me cry.

422
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,800
Then change it.

423
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Let's exchange.

424
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,520
Time for the brothers' diary.

425
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm nervous.

426
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,200
I was afraid I would cry

427
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,960
when I open my eyes.

428
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,119
A day full of emotions.

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,880
You didn't receive my message that day.

430
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,680
Yes.

431
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,040
Fatty saw my unhappiness.

432
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,680
and very angry.

433
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,200
I've always felt

434
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
he is more serious

435
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,319
he is more serious and serious than me.

436
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,560
He always encouraged me

437
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,599
that I'm excellent.

438
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,640
Definitely.

439
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,200
will always be behind me.

440
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,800
In this environment,

441
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,280
no matter what,

442
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,200
you have your siblings.

443
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
I will be there.

444
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,520
I'll be there

445
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,440
She's in a low mood today.

446
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
She's so strong.

447
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,760
I was worried all day.

448
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,840
When cutting the cake,

449
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,240
when cutting the cake.

450
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,040
But after talking,

451
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,440
I still saw her smile.

452
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
It feels strange.

453
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,400
Because I persuaded her

454
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,320
she was happy.

455
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,800
She made me forget the unhappiness

456
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
I met a wrong choice.

457
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,920
I hope you can make your own judgment in the future.

458
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
You can adjust yourself.

459
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,240
That's growth.

460
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,840
Tonight's message

461
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,080
We have zero votes.

462
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,560
I saw the video of my parents tonight

463
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,280
and what my parents said to me.

464
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm He Wenxin, He Wenjie's father.

465
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
Time exchange for brothers' diary.

466
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
I didn't expect my sister to cry first.

467
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
She's always been an excellent student.

468
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
She was under so much pressure

469
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
when I was young.

470
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
You did grow up earlier than me.

471
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
I'll take good care of you now.

472
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm envious of your siblings.

473
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,520
She told me a lot.

474
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,160
Sometimes I have high expectations for her.

475
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,920
From now on,

476
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
I need to learn to communicate.

477
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't be so mean to her.

478
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
But when I saw the video that day,

479
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,960
I was very touched.

480
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,080
When I see

481
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,240
a very harmonious relationship.

482
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,520
I really envy them.

483
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,360
It's okay.

484
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
You can also

485
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,720
It's the first time we went on a long trip.

486
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,480
The first stop is at the most familiar beach.

487
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
I'll win.

488
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,960
Trust me.

489
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Look here.

490
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Look up.

491
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,800
Raise your head.

492
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
A little to my side.

493
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,240
Awesome.

494
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
I think you look good no matter what.

495
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,840
Xin.

496
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,480
My sister is the only one who knows me the best.

497
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
My sister is really pretty.

498
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
I don't feel much seeing her every day.

499
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,800
I can accept

500
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,160
I can accept my zero vote brother.

501
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
They are really ignorant.

502
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
It's so touching.

503
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,320
In life, these four words describe me.

504
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,280
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

505
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
It's pretty.

506
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,720
It's specially made for you.

507
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,440
I can feel it.

508
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Have a seat.

509
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,560
Let's exchange.

510
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,960
Let's exchange.

511
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
Come on.

512
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,160
So did you put your heart into it?

513
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,360
I did.

514
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,000
What about you?

515
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,480
I'll put my heart into it.

516
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
I write until very late every day, okay?

517
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,840
Okay.

518
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,120
You're losing the first page.

519
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,520
How much did you write on the first page?

520
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,560
Let me see.

521
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,480
You...

522
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
Take a look.

523
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,920
Very sad.

524
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,320
Neither of us received any message.

525
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,600
So

526
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,320
I haven't received any message since today.

527
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Right?

528
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes.

529
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Because you didn't receive the text,

530
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
so I made you breakfast, right?

531
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Yes.

532
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,720
This is the first time you made breakfast for me.

533
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
But if you think about it,

534
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,440
I didn't receive it myself.

535
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,000
I made it for you.

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,880
Look how nice I am to you.

537
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Really?

538
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,240
But I need comfort.

539
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,760
Okay.

540
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,520
Thank you very much for

541
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,560
for allowing us

542
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,800
to spend so much time together.

543
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
It's quite sincere.

544
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
It's sincere.

545
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,360
Because I think this kind of opportunity

546
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,200
a chance like this.

547
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,240
When you get married,

548
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,320
When I get married,

549
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,160
I always want to touch you subconsciously.

550
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,280
and get close to you.

551
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,480
Yes.

552
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,200
Don't you think every day in the room

553
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,120
I always want to lean on you

554
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,600
I always want to lean closer to you.

555
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Suddenly,

556
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,280
I stared at you.

557
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,440
I asked you what to do.

558
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
you would avoid me.

559
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,520
You'll stare at me.

560
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,320
I said, "Calm down."

561
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,680
I like to stick to you.

562
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,120
Because of the birth of my nephew,

563
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,760
because of my nephew's birth.

564
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,920
I recalled the time

565
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,520
my care and love for you

566
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,600
much less.

567
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,160
The brothers' diary exchange time.

568
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,200
Did you forget when you were young?

569
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,920
Because of someone,

570
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,840
for a long time.

571
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,760
In my heart,

572
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,480
in my heart.

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,200
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

574
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I know.

575
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
After he was born,

576
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,960
I have some time, no time.

577
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,600
I would go to your house.

578
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,080
Why didn't you tell me?

579
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,440
I don't know.

580
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,200
Why didn't I tell you?

581
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,040
I just

582
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,280
hate me.

583
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,960
At that time,

584
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I could tell

585
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
She even teased me.

586
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,720
Really?

587
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,320
She said

588
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
is playing with his nephew every day.

589
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm not playing with you.

590
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
Seriously.

591
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,560
Yes.

592
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,680
I didn't expect you to say it that day.

593
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Actually, I felt bad.

594
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Because everyone asked me

595
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,240
what kind of sister you are.

596
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
I said I was so nice to my brother.

597
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,960
I never make my brother unhappy.

598
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,080
If I tell him about it,

599
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,760
I think

600
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,440
I didn't do it well.

601
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,400
99 points now.

602
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,040
OK.

603
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,920
99 points.

604
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,160
One point deducted.

605
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,480
Okay.

606
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,760
Well,

607
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm quite happy on a date.

608
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,200
This is the first date

609
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,920
First time with Fatty.

610
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,720
Fatty.

611
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
I usually take the initiative

612
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,440
proactively.

613
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
But Fatty kept pushing the process that day.

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
I felt very relaxed.

615
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
Later you said

616
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
do something according to your heart.

617
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,920
What did you do?

618
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
At that time.

619
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,560
I was...

620
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,600
Fatty was nice to me too.

621
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,480
And Tarri is

622
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,200
a ray of light in the dark.

623
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
Because three times in a row,

624
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
I wasn't chosen.

625
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,720
And then I somehow

626
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
(They're actually a team.)

627
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,640
Time for the brothers' diary.

628
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,320
Let's do it together.

629
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,800
Sure.

630
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,720
Then the two of us...

631
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,320
Thank you.

632
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
Don't slip.

633
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,760
Okay.

634
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,000
Time for the brothers' diary.

635
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,240
Time for the brothers' diary.

636
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,040
Today's date is different.

637
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,920
You went out with Tae-seo

638
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,200
with Tae-seo that day?

639
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
Do you remember

640
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,440
when we were young?

641
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,160
I said

642
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,600
I said I would have more photos

643
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
more than when I was an adult.

644
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,520
Because my mom was with me when I was young.

645
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,880
Tarri and Tata didn't come in.

646
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
I don't know where he came from.

647
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,200
I think I might like to be photographed.

648
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,760
and being recorded.

649
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,120
That day,

650
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
there were

651
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,440
in the camera.

652
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,600
He basically

653
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
of me.

654
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,520
Diaries exchange time.

655
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Let me take a photo for you.

656
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
The city tower?

657
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,000
Okay.

658
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,320
Excuse me.

659
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,960
Excuse me.

660
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Three, two, one.

661
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,880
I enjoyed it too.

662
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:20,960
The brothers' diary exchange time

663
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,400
So when you're being yourself,

664
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,440
others may see you.

665
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't understand

666
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,480
Hua and Terri.

667
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,360
I don't know what will happen to them.

668
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,440
Why can't I understand?

669
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,000
It's easy for us to understand, right?

670
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,000
What do you mean?

671
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,120
I always feel that you two

672
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,040
a little far and close.

673
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,920
Do you understand?

674
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,760
I feel that way too.

675
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,200
Right?

676
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
That's why I don't understand.

677
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,240
Yes.

678
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,120
Actually, after Tarri and I went to Tianjin,

679
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,920
after the trip to Tientsin.

680
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,320
Yes.

681
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
I can see that.

682
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,000
You set off fireworks and took the Ferris wheel.

683
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,840
So you were on a Ferris wheel

684
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,760
with Tae-ri.

685
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
I was looking forward to

686
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,200
for the Ferris wheel.

687
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,120
And Tarri and Fatty are also afraid of heights.

688
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,000
Those two don't want to go.

689
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll say it myself.

690
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm going.

691
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,760
And then,

692
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,680
Tae-seo said,

693
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,760
I can go.

694
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
Don't you know that when we were on the Ferris wheel,

695
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:13,920
he...

696
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,760
Let me move a little.

697
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,520
He's flustered.

698
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
He's nervous.

699
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,880
Just like that.

700
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,920
My legs are shaking.

701
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,120
Don't be afraid, Yinbo.

702
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,920
I'm here.

703
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,680
It's very hasty.

704
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,920
But he overcome his fear.

705
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,520
Take a photo for me.

706
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,600
This was blocked.

707
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm afraid even if I touch him.

708
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,360
But he looked for different angles

709
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,320
to take photos for me.

710
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
It's okay.

711
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,600
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

712
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,840
I think

713
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,760
quite touched.

714
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
I'll be more touched

715
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll be more touched.

716
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,200
What do you mean?

717
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,080
After I and Tae-seo

718
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
came down from the Ferris wheel,

719
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,720
we saw someone

720
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,880
he saw someone setting off fireworks.

721
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,560
He asked me

722
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,160
if I wanted to set off fireworks.

723
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,800
I said yes.

724
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:51,880
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

725
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,440
There are fireworks over there.

726
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,320
Where?

727
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,320
Yes.

728
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,040
He brought it himself.

729
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,280
I asked him to buy some.

730
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
Can you sell some to us?

731
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Just buy one bundle.

732
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
Can I?

733
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,680
Tae-seo told me

734
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
he's a very proactive person.

735
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,120
But when he went to buy fireworks,

736
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,800
with me,

737
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,560
I thought

738
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,880
this is

739
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,920
very happy.

740
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,840
Do you think I won't

741
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
my feelings?

742
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,920
Do you think I'm that irresponsible?

743
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,360
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

744
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,120
Time for the brothers' diary.

745
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,680
See?

746
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,640
But these are photos.

747
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,560
When I received your letter,

748
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,880
when I received your letter,

749
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
I cried to death.

750
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,440
The brothers' diary exchange time.

751
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,000
Let me tell you secretly.

752
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
Every time I talk about you

753
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,160
in front of my friends,

754
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,320
I was very proud.

755
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
They even recommend you

756
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
to my new friends.

757
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,880
Let me take a break.

758
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,720
Wait.

759
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
You're good at writing, right?

760
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,840
You're quite different from usual.

761
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,840
I've heard a lot

762
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,920
and heard a lot.

763
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,360
Her previous experience

764
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,560
is really a good girl.

765
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,280
I think after the recording,

766
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,880
Hua and I will continue to contact each other.

767
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,640
Because both of us are quite free.

768
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,360
Our work

769
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
is quite free.

770
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,320
If both sides

771
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,440
go towards each other,

772
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
after a long time of contact,

773
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,720
I think we still have a chance

774
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
to be together.

775
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Where is she from?

776
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,800
She's from Changsha.

777
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,920
But like me,

778
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,760
are relatively free to work.

779
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,040
So what does she do?

780
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,840
She used to work in a beauty company.

781
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,680
and now she's doing it herself.

782
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,880
Is there anyone else interested in her?

783
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,280
At first,

784
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,040
another guy was also interested in her.

785
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,240
But she might have touched me.

786
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,680
We actually choose each other.

787
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,040
Yes.

788
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
What does she attract you?

789
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,720
I think two people

790
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
in many aspects.

791
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,400
For example?

792
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,040
For example?

793
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,320
I've always been passive.

794
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,720
She might take the initiative.

795
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Do you want dumplings?

796
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,560
Thank you.

797
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,960
What do you want to drink, Yinbo?

798
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,760
It's hot and cold.

799
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Honey water

800
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,960
Honey lemon

801
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,680
International model

802
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
Nice.

803
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,320
What are you doing?

804
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,600
She's the kind of person who takes care of people.

805
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,720
The brothers' diary exchange time.

806
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,960
Thank you.

807
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,240
for caring about my feelings.

808
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Susu.

809
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,480
I want to be with you.

810
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,040
Yes.

811
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,560
I hope you can accept

812
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,880
my kindness to you.

813
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Because I think you deserve it.

814
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
No matter what choice you make,

815
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,960
I support you.

816
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,800
Although life in the small house is over,

817
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,320
I think we just started

818
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,080
Let's hug.

819
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
There's an unspeakable magic.

820
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,360
It's like God thinks

821
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,280
you two should get to know each other.

822
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,640
Yes, you have to.

823
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,240
So I'm really lucky

824
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,160
and beautiful.

825
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,800
Let’s applaud

826
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
our brave members.

827
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,400
thank you.

828
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,440
I hope you can always believe

829
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,400
there will always be someone

830
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,600
love you because you are you.

831
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,960
We also hope that

832
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,560
can continue

833
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
and continue to express love

834
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,680
in our lives.

835
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
In this journey,

836
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
no matter what the result is,

837
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,960
whether we've gained love,

838
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,520
But we must have become

839
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
a better family and lover.

840
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,640
Thank you again

841
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,880
for your contribution

842
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,680
This is the end of our first season.

843
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm going to say goodbye.

844
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,840
Unwilling

845
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,200
Let's say our slogan for the last time.

846
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
Love Sisters

847
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,560
Double the love.

848
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,040
It's really over.

849
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,240
Love Siblings.

850
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,600
Love Siblings.

851
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,280
Double love.

852
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,560
Thank you all for dating

853
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
In the observation room

854
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,760
in the observation room

855
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,560
together.

856
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,280
What impressed me the most

857
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,760
are

858
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,520
are

859
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,400
Brother.

860
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,080
Mr. Huang Hongfan.

861
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
and Mr. Lu.

862
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,640
and Mr. Dodon.

863
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
so deeply.

864
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
mainly because

865
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,800
his growth environment

866
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,680
and the way of education

867
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,760
is more similar to our family.

868
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,240
Many of my ideas

869
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,720
he can relate to me

870
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,080
in time.

871
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
Thank you for supporting us

872
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,000
for supporting us.

873
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,640
and like us.

874
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,080
and support our show.

875
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,400
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

876
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Actually, when I watch the show,

877
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,920
I have a lot of different feelings.

878
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,520
At that time, I will see Ms. Lu

879
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
on the screen.

880
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,600
when I saw Ms. Lu

881
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,360
my feelings.

882
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,040
So I think

883
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,760
Ms. Lu is like

884
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,560
a bosom friend across the screen.

885
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm very happy

886
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
through "Love Siblings",

887
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,160
know me.

888
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,480
Thank you for

889
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
for your understanding and support.

890
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,000
especially Dan.

891
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,480
Brother.

892
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
And Song Yeon-ju.

893
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
When I had a conflict with the soup,

894
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
you were really worried.

895
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you, Dan.

896
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
for understanding

897
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,760
what I did.

898
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,960
Lastly, thank you for your love for sweet candy.

899
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,800
We've received your blessings.

900
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Thank all the love family members

901
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
for your support and company.

902
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,800
And I think

903
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
Mr. Wu Zun and Mr. Zhu Dan

904
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
take me

905
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,600
It's kind of like watching

906
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,200
of Cyber's son.

907
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,960
Mr. Wu Zun.

908
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,600
From beginning to end,

909
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,080
his concepts and ideas

910
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,920
are very similar to mine.

911
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
So they've been encouraging me and supporting me.

912
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,960
No matter where you are,

913
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
no matter where you are.

914
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,040
because of this love.

915
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,480
Although the house is over,

916
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
this love is still there

917
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,440
Thank the teachers of the loving family members

918
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
for spending

919
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,920
with us.

920
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,640
and witnessed our growth.

921
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,320
I'd like to say to Ms. Lu

922
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,240
I've liked you for a long time.

923
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,960
I also remember you said in the show

924
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,240
you need to do well

925
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,160
to get the appropriate love of my family.

926
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,280
I can relate to that.

927
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,120
I also like what you said.

928
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,000
I wore those

929
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,200
lost, anxious, inferiority, despair,

930
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,520
I became who I am now.

931
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,680
Our existence is worth being loved.

932
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
I hope I can be like you

933
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,360
like you.

934
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,680
Be strong and confident forever.

935
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,800
optimistic and cheerful.

936
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,960
I also want to tell Mi-na

937
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,640
It's said that girls

938
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,360
understand women's weakness the most.

939
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,800
and cherish each other.

940
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,040
Thank you for understanding me.

941
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,920
I hope your friends

942
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
your friends who understand you

943
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,960
who understands you.

944
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
I wish you happiness every day

945
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,600
and be happy.

946
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,560
I want to say

947
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,600
thank you for your encouragement.

948
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,440
Actually at the beginning of the show,

949
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
I was very nervous and nervous.

950
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
But when I just showed up,

951
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,320
your encouragement

952
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,560
made me feel

953
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,440
anxiety and anxiety

954
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,320
are gone.

955
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,280
I want to tell Mr. Yang Gen

956
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm a happy puppy in the house.

957
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,360
to make everyone happy.

958
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,800
In the observation room,

959
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,720
you're like a "Happy Machine".

960
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,320
You've brought us a lot of joy and surprises.

961
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,000
Thank you for your support

962
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
for your support and company.

963
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,400
I want to tell Zun

964
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,600
don't be angry.

965
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,320
Yours.

966
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,440
I picked up the script for you.

967
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,800
The second one is I want to tell Dunhan

968
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,840
the theme song is really good.

969
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,960
And I really like Mr. Dodon.

970
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,920
Thank you for your support

971
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,280
for supporting us.

972
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,320
and advice.

973
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,960
I've gained a lot.

974
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,400
I really want to thank you for your love.

975
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
In love,

976
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,360
I have many immature things.

977
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,760
but this journey has made me grow a lot.

978
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,280
Thank you for your blessing.

979
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,840
I hope we can find

980
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,360
the right person soon.

981
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,040
Come on.

982
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
Thank you

983
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,840
for your encouragement and support.

984
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,440
I want to say

985
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,160
thank you for pointing out

986
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,320
on the show.

987
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
As a man, I should take the initiative

988
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,680
and pay more attention to details.

989
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,760
Touch girls through details.

990
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,680
I'll remember what you said.

991
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,520
Keep up the good work.

992
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,320
First of all, thank you

993
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,360
in our studio

994
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,560
accompanied us through so many episodes.

995
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,680
And I learned a lot

996
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,320
from learning.

997
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,800
and grew up with everyone.

998
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,960
It's a surprise.

999
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,880
I'm very happy

1000
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,520
to meet you like this.

1001
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,480
Thank you very much

1002
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,800
on the show.

1003
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
from the third perspective,

1004
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,080
more clearly

1005
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,480
the reason behind some words.

1006
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
and more objective

1007
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,200
more objectively.

1008
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
what I didn't do perfectly.

1009
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,120
It helped me a lot.

1010
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,520
And here,

1011
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,760
I'd like to thank mentor Ziying.

1012
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,320
I think

1013
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
is very direct.

1014
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,320
I agree with the way I play straight.

1015
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,120
Thank you very much

1016
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Really?

1017
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,280
He's really coming.

1018
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Open the door.

1019
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,679
This song should go with those two.

1020
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
If it weren't for those two,

1021
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,040
why do we look like this?

1022
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,199
This is really...

1023
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,679
You look better in person.

1024
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,080
Center.

1025
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,800
I got goose bumps.

1026
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,159
Let's welcome our sweet couple

1027
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,080
to our scene.

1028
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,120
Our Sue Soup is here.

1029
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,199
because

1030
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,639
Love Sisters.

1031
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,360
So I came here.

1032
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,560
What wedding candies are these?

1033
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,280
We brought you sweets.

1034
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,040
Give it to me.

1035
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
It's too sweet.

1036
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,560
Thank you.

1037
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,080
I hope my baby will look like this in the future.

1038
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,000
Maybe.

1039
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
Come on.

1040
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,280
Mixed blood.

1041
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,800
Yes.

1042
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,320
Let's invite the soup and Susu

1043
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,680
and say hello

1044
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,960
Hello, I'm Soup.

1045
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,200
It's nice to meet you.

1046
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,800
Hello.

1047
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,400
Welcome soup.

1048
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Thank you.

1049
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,600
Hello, everyone. I'm Susu.

1050
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm very happy to be here.

1051
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,680
We're happy too.

1052
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,480
The sweet couple.

1053
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,640
We met in person.

1054
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes.

1055
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,360
I watched it on TV.

1056
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,720
I saw him in person today.

1057
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,760
This sentence is usually

1058
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,280
to the mentors.

1059
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,480
We're the same.

1060
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,280
Actually, after our sweet couple started,

1061
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,440
we've been loved by many viewers.

1062
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
We've collected

1063
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
the questions from the viewers.

1064
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Next, our family members

1065
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,480
each of you will draw a blind box.

1066
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,320
We have to

1067
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,080
in turn.

1068
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,360
Isn't this the blind box

1069
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,640
in the Confession Bureau?

1070
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,240
Yes.

1071
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,600
Here.

1072
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Thank you.

1073
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,560
It's time to take our big test.

1074
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,520
Nervous.

1075
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,320
Okay.

1076
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,720
Let's start with Mi-na.

1077
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,000
netizens,

1078
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,040
After watching the show,

1079
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,880
which episode do you think is the most dramatic?

1080
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,600
and famous scenes?

1081
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,960
I think the famous scene is the snowy day.

1082
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,560
Because it's very sudden.

1083
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
I didn't know it would snow the next day.

1084
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
I was thinking

1085
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,040
I didn't see snow in Beijing this year.

1086
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,880
Unfortunately,

1087
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,960
It's really snowing.

1088
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,560
It's snowing.

1089
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,120
It's snowing.

1090
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,680
Yes.

1091
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
This should be romantic.

1092
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,800
Let's listen to some dramatic

1093
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,240
we want to hear some dramatic

1094
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
But that's really romantic.

1095
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,920
I like the unfaired version.

1096
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,320
Yes, me too.

1097
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,400
Let me ask

1098
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
if you haven't

1099
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
We already kissed.

1100
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,480
Yes.

1101
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,560
No, no.

1102
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,920
So that was the first time.

1103
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,680
Yes.

1104
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
Okay.

1105
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,040
The netizens said

1106
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,600
Are you still a young teacher?

1107
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,720
A guiding lover.

1108
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,360
Su Su is a little weak.

1109
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,080
"Lin Daiyu."

1110
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,240
She may get sick once a month.

1111
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,480
At this time, I'm a "young teacher".

1112
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,960
She's a "young teacher".

1113
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,400
What should I do? Do it well.

1114
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
Jiang Dunhao, pay attention to your expression.

1115
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
You haven’t had this expression for the whole season.

1116
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,480
That's what I call a couple.

1117
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
I'll protect them.

1118
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Your background music

1119
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
It's their exclusive.

1120
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,040
You're so sweet.

1121
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,400
That's what I like.

1122
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,640
So sweet.

1123
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,200
It's easier to eat on site.

1124
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
During the show,

1125
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,040
and other guests

1126
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
have you reviewed it privately?

1127
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,080
in the show?

1128
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,480
I review it myself.

1129
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,200
For example, on that day,

1130
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,120
I didn't know

1131
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,280
how Su Su and Terri

1132
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,800
is like.

1133
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,880
I'll analyze it one by one.

1134
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,400
I'll just take a look.

1135
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,880
But after so many days

1136
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,080
I've grown a lot.

1137
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,280
It's actually quite interesting.

1138
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,000
If you

1139
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,560
from the perspective of God,

1140
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,480
there will be many different ideas.

1141
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
I really care about our soup.

1142
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,280
No, don't talk nonsense.

1143
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,680
This is the most memorable

1144
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,480
or the most ridiculous live comments.

1145
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
or online comments.

1146
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,680
I'm a social media platform.

1147
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,200
People will say

1148
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,480
with the photo of the soup,

1149
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
I want this "dad".

1150
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,640
I want this "dad".

1151
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,360
Are you thinking of being your child?

1152
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,920
Yes.

1153
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,760
Fall on them.

1154
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,640
Parents' love.

1155
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Yes.

1156
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,360
The netizens are crying in my comment zone.

1157
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,120
in my comment zone.

1158
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,080
Crying Girl.

1159
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,520
But it's actually quite fun.

1160
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah.

1161
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,720
We were worried about your cry.

1162
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Yes.

1163
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,960
Let me ask Susu.

1164
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
if your family

1165
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,520
about you?

1166
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,920
My dad saw my performance.

1167
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,320
For example,

1168
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,080
the soup crying.

1169
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
What should I explain to him?

1170
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,280
My dad said you did nothing wrong.

1171
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,240
You're fine.

1172
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,040
You did well.

1173
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,800
Yes, he kept praising me.

1174
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,080
Did he think about the soup?

1175
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
He has no comment.

1176
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,080
No evaluation.

1177
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,040
No evaluation.

1178
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,520
Good. Don't pressure him.

1179
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:05,880
Yes.

1180
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
I think her family is very open.

1181
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,400
A very open parent.

1182
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,080
Yes.

1183
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,760
So don't be so stressed.

1184
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,080
Another question.

1185
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Stewed ribs with pickles

1186
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
Whose mom made it

1187
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,560
It wasn't my mom.

1188
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,200
My mom did it.

1189
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,840
I thought it was my mom.

1190
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,880
I misunderstood.

1191
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Okay.

1192
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,960
Because my mom likes pickles too.

1193
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,920
My question is about Susu.

1194
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,000
Is there any difference

1195
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
in the show?

1196
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,520
I think it's almost the same.

1197
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,640
They are all very real.

1198
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,920
But he's nervous in the show.

1199
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,080
When he's offline,

1200
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,920
he would be more relaxed.

1201
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,080
He didn't say there was a string.

1202
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,960
We can communicate more smoothly.

1203
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,160
He's nervous now.

1204
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
Because there are cameras now.

1205
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,280
Yes.

1206
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
Run!

1207
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,720
Okay, I have one more.

1208
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,840
Excuse me.

1209
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,120
What's the name

1210
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,760
on WeChat?

1211
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,320
Is there any nickname?

1212
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,680
I gave it to Tom.

1213
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,600
A cat's expression symbol.

1214
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,520
And then the caro-shattered puppy version.

1215
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,720
I saw him crying a while ago,

1216
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,480
so I changed it to the version of the torn puppy.

1217
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,640
When you watch the show,

1218
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,160
he cried so much for you.

1219
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,680
What did you say to him?

1220
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,080
You cared so much about me.

1221
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,960
Your works

1222
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,600
are well-educated.

1223
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,000
Really.

1224
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,760
Your writing is amazing.

1225
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,640
Great.

1226
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
emotional value.

1227
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,040
The soup has changed.

1228
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,720
You look more cheerful.

1229
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm going to dig a hole.

1230
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,200
The name of the soup for Susu is

1231
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
Susu, Susy, pig.

1232
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,680
Pig.

1233
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,600
Suzy pig.

1234
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,960
Piggy expression symbol.

1235
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,320
My question is

1236
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,520
As an audience,

1237
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,480
which couple do you like the most

1238
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,720
or siblings.

1239
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,680
After the show,

1240
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,920
when I watched the show,

1241
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,960
I was quite addicted to Fatty and Xinxin.

1242
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
Brotherhood.

1243
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,600
Which soup do you like?

1244
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,800
In love,

1245
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm in love with Susu.

1246
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,160
Okay.

1247
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,280
And we're family.

1248
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,360
Actually, I'm in love with Xiao Ling.

1249
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
mainly because...

1250
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,680
Really.

1251
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,160
Maybe when I watch the show,

1252
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,480
Because when I was in the show,

1253
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,800
I can't feel

1254
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
how mature she is.

1255
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,640
including her ability to handle things.

1256
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,440
in handling things.

1257
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,480
And she's confident.

1258
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,400
and calm.

1259
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,880
Then I found that

1260
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,640
So amazing.

1261
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,800
Because we can't see each other

1262
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,880
after we went to college.

1263
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,240
During the holiday, I was also training in other places.

1264
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,080
or she had a shoot.

1265
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,280
So we really

1266
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,840
for about four years

1267
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,920
for about four years.

1268
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,560
She's different from four years ago.

1269
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,320
You don't know when you cried,

1270
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,920
when you cried.

1271
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,920
We cried so hard.

1272
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,880
I think the mood in the room

1273
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
will be magnified.

1274
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:47,960
Because

1275
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,400
Yes.

1276
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,720
We don't focus on social activities.

1277
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,120
I usually train in class.

1278
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,440
for 20 minutes.

1279
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,760
I've been socializing for a day.

1280
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,600
In the small house, from morning to night,

1281
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,120
for so many days.

1282
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,720
Okay, don't look for it. You're just a crybaby.

1283
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,080
That's right.

1284
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,200
Crying Girl.

1285
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,120
OK, my question.

1286
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,240
The first one is the soup.

1287
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,000
When can I learn

1288
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,160
When can I learn it?

1289
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,800
Yes.

1290
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,800
But he was stuttering.

1291
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
I haven't heard it yet

1292
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,720
Not yet.

1293
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,440
I don't dare to send it to her when I play badly.

1294
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,600
Then she was disappointed. I was afraid.

1295
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,520
I won't.

1296
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,040
I won't.

1297
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,400
What matters is her feelings.

1298
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,360
She won't think you played it perfectly.

1299
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,080
Right, Susu?

1300
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,080
Yang Gen won't mind, right?

1301
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,600
Family.

1302
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,080
It's true.

1303
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,800
Make your eyes...

1304
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,320
Yes, next question.

1305
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,000
Susu.

1306
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,120
Actually, a couple

1307
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,680
had some misunderstandings in the cabin.

1308
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,320
Which time was your biggest panic?

1309
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,600
I think if I didn't come back

1310
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,840
if I didn't come back,

1311
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,600
I should have

1312
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,280
when I texted him.

1313
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,680
The time I texted Tae-seo.

1314
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,320
and explain to him.

1315
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,040
The first time I saw his eyes red,

1316
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
I said something was wrong.

1317
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Then I went to him and he turned me down.

1318
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,360
After that,

1319
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,120
I had a lot of psychological fights.

1320
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,600
He said he would go to him again.

1321
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,080
Then I saw his eyes red.

1322
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,800
I asked him if he cried.

1323
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,960
He said he didn't cry.

1324
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
That was...

1325
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,480
I think

1326
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,760
I might not be good.

1327
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,560
But...

1328
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,320
Because for the second time,

1329
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,520
I think

1330
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,400
is different from his.

1331
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,720
So we both have our own grievances.

1332
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,840
It's nice.

1333
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,720
Looking back, it's all an experience.

1334
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,920
No need.

1335
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,560
This is a good question.

1336
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,000
Let's share the date

1337
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,080
after the recording.

1338
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
What did you do?

1339
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,880
I want to hear this.

1340
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,280
When the show is not officially announced,

1341
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,320
we went out

1342
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,440
and went out once.

1343
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,720
We went to the Shicha Sea.

1344
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,240
But there's no ice left.

1345
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,600
It's a pity.

1346
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,960
We went to a cafe.

1347
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,480
There was a cat inside.

1348
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,560
We went to the cat café again.

1349
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,680
But I was very happy that time.

1350
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,320
Maybe

1351
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,040
to make up for the show.

1352
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,760
Yes, when I took a picture,

1353
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,280
I said it felt familiar.

1354
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,960
One more question.

1355
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
Do you have

1356
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,520
Is there a new record of love?

1357
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,800
You can look forward to it.

1358
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,320
Where should we look forward to it?

1359
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,360
Send it out.

1360
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
You need to play the piano too.

1361
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,280
Let's listen together.

1362
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,400
Yes.

1363
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,280
Although we're the only ones here today,

1364
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,200
we all brought gifts.

1365
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,640
We want to

1366
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,400
to the netizens

1367
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,920
who watched us grow up.

1368
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,240
We may need the mentors

1369
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,280
to write a message

1370
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,200
to each of us.

1371
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,680
We each draw one, right?

1372
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,600
Two of you can draw two.

1373
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,000
Let’s start with Mr. Lynne.

1374
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,560
OK.

1375
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,760
Pick one yourself.

1376
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,400
I'll get one for her.

1377
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,800
"Prince".

1378
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,560
Prince.

1379
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,200
Huang ZiHongfan.

1380
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,520
I never thought

1381
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,280
Zun helped Huang Hongfan.

1382
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,480
This is

1383
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,440
they used before.

1384
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,240
It says

1385
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,920
I met

1386
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,040
who can record my friends.

1387
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
I hope you, who received the gift,

1388
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,040
take it and record yourself.

1389
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,480
You can also hand it to your friends.

1390
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,920
Let them record the cutest you

1391
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,320
May the film in the camera

1392
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,200
can determine your happy moments

1393
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,800
and form the negative of your life together.

1394
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,440
It's great.

1395
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,640
Guess whose it is.

1396
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,280
Flower.

1397
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,680
Why are you so sure it's Hwa?

1398
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,320
Record?

1399
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,520
She cares more about being recorded.

1400
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,480
This is Huahua's film camera.

1401
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,600
Okay, I got hand cream.

1402
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,560
Two things for winter.

1403
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,640
Apply hand cream and get close to the one you like.

1404
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,880
Here.

1405
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,040
The hand cream is carefully delivered.

1406
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,720
The first step to approach each other.

1407
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,160
I hope you, who received this gift,

1408
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,960
can also receive unexpected surprises

1409
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,440
and the sweetness of both ways.

1410
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Just like our sweet couple.

1411
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,400
So romantic.

1412
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:48,680
Romantic.

1413
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,120
How long did you hide it to send it out?

1414
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,080
Two days.

1415
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,360
Just put it in your pocket.

1416
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,520
Hide behind this cushion

1417
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,280
Put it up and hide it behind

1418
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,520
I don't know how to send it

1419
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,600
When we get the soup,

1420
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,560
the hand cream is warm.

1421
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,240
I played volleyball

1422
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,680
I played volleyball with Xiaoling.

1423
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,320
Throw it down from the second floor.

1424
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,360
I want to give volleyball as a gift.

1425
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,520
because when Xiaoling and I

1426
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,760
playing volleyball,

1427
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,360
there were live comments

1428
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,240
The map rearranged "playing straight".

1429
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,720
I hope when you receive a gift,

1430
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,360
When you meet someone you like,

1431
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,600
when you meet someone you like.

1432
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,320
No regrets.

1433
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,680
Why are there so many games?

1434
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,920
The game they play inside.

1435
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,440
Who is the mole? Mahjong cards.

1436
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,040
Yes.

1437
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
He plays games.

1438
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,160
Let me guess who can play games.

1439
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,560
Xiao Ling.

1440
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,760
Really?

1441
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,760
I don't know.

1442
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,600
The board game is something

1443
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,240
in the room.

1444
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,040
It's also a memorable moment

1445
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,120
a memorable moment.

1446
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,840
I hope it can bring happiness

1447
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,480
to the viewers.

1448
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,640
Xiao Ling.

1449
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,360
I think Xiao Ling loves playing games.

1450
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,440
It's Xiaoling's.

1451
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,400
We look so familiar.

1452
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,280
There's another one I'm helping Song.

1453
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,640
Book of Questions.

1454
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,840
You really like reading Book of Questions.

1455
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,720
Actually, before you open it,

1456
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,920
you already have the answer in your heart.

1457
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,160
The Book of Answer is just

1458
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,040
is looking for the voice that supports your heart.

1459
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,240
I hope you can

1460
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,760
can flip it when you're lost.

1461
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,400
you'll know

1462
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,960
your true thoughts.

1463
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,960
Right?

1464
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,000
Do you remember this

1465
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Pumpkin.

1466
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,960
Is it Xin's?

1467
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,720
I drink this every day.

1468
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,640
Pumpkin juice.

1469
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,000
It not only opened

1470
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,600
in my room,

1471
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,160
And it quickly approaches the house.

1472
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:31,880
Jiang Dunhao.

1473
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,520
Growing grass.

1474
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,720
The relationship between members.

1475
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,000
I hope you can

1476
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,600
can be in the best state

1477
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,920
to welcome the wonderful day.

1478
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,800
So pumpkin juice really reduces swelling

1479
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,320
Really

1480
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,600
This is Huang Zihong's.

1481
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,640
What's inside this?

1482
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,040
This is handmade.

1483
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,760
Tofu.

1484
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,360
Yes.

1485
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,400
This gift

1486
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,160
is the combination beans I experienced with Hua.

1487
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,880
Love is like piecing beans.

1488
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,040
accumulates more.

1489
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,360
Although the process is slow,

1490
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
but the moment it was completed

1491
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,720
It's full of joy.

1492
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,840
I hope you, who received this gift,

1493
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,760
can also make a beautiful pattern of love.

1494
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,400
It's a water glass.

1495
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,320
Fatty bought a glass for Hua.

1496
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,840
This is the first item

1497
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,120
in the house.

1498
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,760
and started the social life of the house with it.

1499
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,880
I hope this gift

1500
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,520
can fill your happiness

1501
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,800
for you who are busy with life.

1502
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,680
Okay, thank you, Fatty.

1503
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,040
It's a hat.

1504
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,320
This hat is in the small house.

1505
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,200
accompanied me when I was sad.

1506
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,480
Wearing it, you can disguise yourself

1507
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,600
to hide and cry.

1508
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,000
I hope you can

1509
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
you can have someone

1510
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,280
someone who cares about you will be with you

1511
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,280
to protect you from the wind and rain.

1512
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,120
Tata.

1513
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,360
She likes wearing this kind of hat.

1514
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,600
Tata.

1515
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,080
Isn't this Porky?

1516
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,720
No, Harry.

1517
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,320
Harry.

1518
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,120
Pinch it when you feel pressured.

1519
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,440
This gift has a special meaning.

1520
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,120
Because I'm a person who gets nervous easily

1521
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,400
